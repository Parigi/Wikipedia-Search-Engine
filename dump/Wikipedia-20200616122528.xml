'''Renewable energy''' is energy that is collected from [[renewable resource]]s, which are naturally replenished on a [[Orders of magnitude (time)|human timescale]], such as [[sunlight]], [[wind power|wind]], [[rain]], [[tidal power|tides]], [[wave power|waves]], and [[geothermal energy|geothermal heat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellabban | first1 = Omar | last2 = Abu-Rub | first2 = Haitham | last3 = Blaabjerg | first3 = Frede | year = 2014 | title = Renewable energy resources: Current status, future prospects and their enabling technology | url = | journal = [[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]] | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 748–764 [749] | doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2014.07.113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable energy often provides energy in four important areas: [[electricity generation]], [[space heating|air]] and [[water heating]]/[[air conditioning|cooling]], [[transportation]], and [[Stand-alone power system|rural (off-grid)]] energy services.&lt;ref name=ren15&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewables 2010 Global Status Report|url=https://www.harbortaxgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/REN21_GSR_2010_full_revised-Sept2010.pdf|publisher=REN21|date=September 2010|accessdate=October 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on [[REN21]]'s 2017 report, renewables contributed 19.3% to humans' [[World energy consumption|global energy consumption]] and 24.5% to their generation of electricity in 2015 and 2016, respectively. This energy consumption is divided as 8.9% coming from traditional [[biomass]], 4.2% as heat energy (modern biomass, geothermal and solar heat), 3.9% from hydroelectricity and the remaining 2.2% is electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and other forms of biomass. Worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than US$286 billion in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[[REN21]], [http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_FullReport_.pdf Global Status Report 2016].

Renewable energy flows involve natural phenomena such as [[sunlight]], [[wind]], [[tide]]s, [[Biomass|plant growth]], and [[Geothermal heating|geothermal heat]], as the [[International Energy Agency]] explains:&lt;ref&gt;IEA Renewable Energy Working Party (2002). ''Renewable Energy... into the mainstream'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly. In its various forms, it derives directly from the sun, or from heat generated deep within the earth. Included in the definition is electricity and heat generated from solar, wind, ocean, [[hydropower]], biomass, geothermal resources, and biofuels and hydrogen derived from renewable resources.}}

Renewable energy resources and significant opportunities for [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries. Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency, and technological diversification of energy sources, would result in significant [[Energy security and renewable technology|energy security]] and economic benefits.&lt;ref name="International Energy Agency 2012" /&gt; It would also reduce environmental [[pollution]] such as [[air pollution]] caused by burning of fossil fuels and improve public health, reduce premature mortalities due to pollution and save associated health costs that amount to several hundred billion dollars annually only in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Mark Z. | authorlink = Mark Z.

National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond, and some 120 countries have various policy targets for longer-term shares of renewable energy, including a 20% target of all electricity generated for the European Union by 2020. Some countries have much higher long-term policy targets of up to 100% renewables. Outside Europe, a diverse group of 20 or more other countries target renewable energy shares in the 2020–2030 time frame that range from 10% to 50%.&lt;ref name="ren2017"/&gt;

Renewable energy often displaces conventional fuels in four areas: [[electricity generation]], [[Solar water heating|hot water]]/[[space heating]], [[transportation]], and rural (off-grid) energy services:&lt;ref name="ren15" /&gt;
* '''Power generation'''
: By 2040, renewable energy is projected to equal coal and natural gas electricity generation. Several jurisdictions, including Denmark, Germany, the state of South Australia and some US states have achieved high integration of variable renewables. For example, in 2015 wind power met 42% of electricity demand in Denmark, 23.2% in Portugal and 15.5% in Uruguay. Interconnectors enable countries to balance electricity systems by allowing the import and export of renewable energy. Innovative hybrid systems have emerged between countries and regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=REN21|title=Renewables 2016: Global Status Report|url=http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report.pdf|website=Renewable Energy Policy Network|accessdate=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Heating'''
: [[Solar water heating]] makes an important contribution to [[renewable heat]] in many countries, most notably in China, which now has 70% of the global total (180&amp;nbsp;GWth). Most of these systems are installed on multi-family apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated 50–60 million households in China. Worldwide, total installed [[solar water heating]] systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households. The use of biomass for heating continues to grow as well. In Sweden, national use of biomass energy has surpassed that of oil. Direct geothermal for heating is also growing rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fast Growth for Copper-Based Geothermal Heating &amp; Cooling|url=http://en.coppercanada.ca/videos-publications/videos/bright-new-age/geothermal.html|accessdate=26 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426225322/http://en.coppercanada.ca/videos-publications/videos/bright-new-age/geothermal.html|archive-date=26 April 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newest addition to Heating is from [[Geothermal heat pump|Geothermal Heat Pumps]] which provide both heating and cooling, and also flatten the electric demand curve and are thus an increasing national priority&lt;ref name="energy.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/geothermal-heat-pumps|title=Geothermal Heat Pumps - Department of Energy|website=energy.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Net Zero Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://netzerofoundation.org|title=Net Zero Foundation|website=netzerofoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Renewable thermal energy]]).
* '''Transportation'''
[[File:Soybeanbus.jpg|thumb|A bus fueled by [[biodiesel]]]]

:[[Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]], mostly from [[carbohydrate]]s produced in [[sugar]] or [[starch]] crops such as [[Maize|corn]], [[sugarcane]], or [[sweet sorghum]]. [[cellulose|Cellulosic biomass]], derived from non-food sources such as trees and grasses is also being developed as a [[feedstock]] for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] [[Fuel additive|additive]] to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[Biofuel in the United States|USA]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]]. [[Biodiesel]] can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[diesel fuel|diesel]] additive to reduce levels of particulates, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[hydrocarbon]]s from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common [[biofuel]] in Europe.

:A [[solar vehicle]] is an [[electric vehicle]] powered completely or significantly by direct [[solar energy]]. Usually, [[photovoltaic]] (PV) cells contained in [[solar panel]]s convert the [[sun]]'s energy directly into [[electric energy]]. The term "solar vehicle" usually implies that solar energy is used to power all or part of a vehicle's [[Vehicle propulsion|propulsion]]. [[Solar power]] may be also used to provide power for communications or controls or other auxiliary functions. Solar vehicles are not sold as practical day-to-day transportation devices at present, but are primarily demonstration vehicles and engineering exercises, often sponsored by government agencies. High-profile examples include [[Tûranor PlanetSolar|PlanetSolar]] and [[Solar Impulse]]. However, indirectly solar-charged vehicles are widespread and [[Electric boat|solar boats]] are available commercially.

== History ==

Prior to the development of coal in the mid 19th century, nearly all energy used was renewable. Almost without a doubt the oldest known use of renewable energy, in the form of traditional [[biomass]] to fuel fires, dates from more than a million years ago.

In the 1860s and 1870s there were already fears that civilization would run out of fossil fuels and the need was felt for a better source. In 1873 Professor [[Augustin Mouchot]] wrote:

[[Max Weber]] mentioned the end of fossil fuel in the concluding paragraphs of his [[Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus]] (The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism), published in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Weber suggests that the modern economic world will determine the lifestyle of everyone born into it "until the last [[hundredweight]] of fossil fuel is burned" (''[http://www.zeno.org/Soziologie/M/Weber,+Max/Schriften+zur+Religionssoziologie/Die+protestantische+Ethik+und+der+Geist+des+Kapitalismus/II.+Die+Berufsethik+des+asketischen+Protestantismus/2.+Askese+und+kapitalistischer+Geist bis der letzte Zentner fossilen Brennstoffs verglüht ist]'').&lt;/ref&gt; Development of solar engines continued until the outbreak of World War I. The importance of solar energy was recognized in a 1911 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article: "in the far distant future, [[Fossil fuel|natural fuels]] having been exhausted [solar power] will remain as the only means of existence of the human race".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbs.edu/research/pdf/12-105.pdf "Power from Sunshine": A Business History of Solar Energy] 25 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

This section is for a basic description of the main renewable energy technologies. New and emerging technologies should be added to the section towards the end of the article. Pros and cons of different technologies are discussed in [[Renewable energy debate]]. Thanks. --&gt;

=== Wind power ===
{{Main|Wind power}}

In 2018, worldwide [[Installed wind power capacity|installed capacity]] of wind power was 564&amp;nbsp;GW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://resourceirena.irena.org/gateway/dashboard/?topic=4&amp;subTopic=19|title=Data and Statistics - IRENA REsource|website=resourceirena.irena.org|language=en|access-date=2019-04-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128183740/http://resourceirena.irena.org/gateway/dashboard/?topic=4&amp;subTopic=19|archive-date=28 November 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air flow can be used to run [[wind turbine]]s. Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600&amp;nbsp;kW to 9 MW of rated power. The power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine.&lt;ref name="EWEA"&gt;{{cite web | title = Analysis of Wind Energy in the EU-25 | publisher = European Wind Energy Association | url = http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/ewea_documents/documents/publications/WETF/Facts_Summary.pdf | accessdate = 11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high-[[altitude]] sites, are preferred locations for wind farms. Typically, [[Capacity factor|full load hours]] of wind turbines vary between 16 and 57 percent annually, but might be higher in particularly favorable offshore sites.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Kaltschmitt]], Wolfgang Streicher, Andreas Wiese (eds.): ''Erneuerbare Energien. Systemtechnik, Wirtschaftlichkeit, Umweltaspekte''. Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg 2013, p. 819.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind-generated electricity met nearly 4% of global electricity demand in 2015, with nearly 63&amp;nbsp;GW of new wind power capacity installed. Wind energy was the leading source of new capacity in Europe, the US and Canada, and the second largest in China. In Denmark, wind energy met more than 40% of its electricity demand while Ireland, Portugal and Spain each met nearly 20%.

Globally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production, or 40 times current electricity demand, assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome. This would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas, particularly in areas of higher wind resources, such as offshore. As offshore wind speeds average ~90% greater than that of land, so offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land-stationed turbines.&lt;ref&gt;"Offshore stations experience mean wind speeds at 80 m that are 90% greater than over land on average." [http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/winds/global_winds.html Evaluation of global wind power] "Overall, the researchers calculated winds at 80 meters [300 feet] above [[sea level]] traveled over the ocean at approximately 8.6 meters per second and at nearly 4.5 meters per second over land [20 and 10 miles per hour, respectively]."

=== Hydropower ===
{{Main|Hydroelectricity|Hydropower|}}
[[File:ThreeGorgesDam-China2009.jpg|thumb|The [[Three Gorges Dam]] on the [[Yangtze River]] in China]]
In 2017, worldwide renewable hydropower capacity was 1,154&amp;nbsp;GW.&lt;ref name="IRENA2018" /&gt;

Since water is about 800 times [[Density of air|denser than air]], even a slow flowing stream of water, or moderate sea [[Swell (ocean)|swell]], can yield considerable amounts of energy. There are many forms of water energy:
* Historically, hydroelectric power came from constructing large hydroelectric dams and reservoirs, which are still popular in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moran|first=Emilio F.|last2=Lopez|first2=Maria Claudia|last3=Moore|first3=Nathan|last4=Müller|first4=Norbert|last5=Hyndman|first5=David W.|date=2018|title=Sustainable hydropower in the 21st century|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=115|issue=47|pages=11891–11898|doi=10.1073/pnas.1809426115|pmid=30397145|issn=0027-8424|pmc=6255148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of largest hydroelectric power stations|largest]] of them are the [[Three Gorges Dam]] (2003) in [[China]] and the [[Itaipu Dam]] (1984) built by Brazil and Paraguay.
* [[Small hydro]] systems are hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to {{nowrap|50 MW}} of power. They are often used on small rivers or as a low-impact development on larger rivers. China is the largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world and has more than 45,000 small hydro installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/RE_Technologies_Cost_Analysis-HYDROPOWER.pdf |title=DocHdl2OnPN-PRINTRDY-01tmpTarget |date= |accessdate=2019-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity]] plants derive energy from rivers without the creation of a large [[reservoir]]. The water is typically conveyed along the side of the river valley (using channels, pipes and/or tunnels) until it is high above the valley floor, whereupon it can allowed to fall through a penstock to drive a turbine. This style of generation may still produce a large amount of electricity, such as the [[Chief Joseph Dam]] on the Columbia river in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|url=https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Run-of-the-river_hydroelectricity|last=Afework|first=Bethel|date=3 September 2018|work=Energy Education|accessdate=27 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many run-of-the-river hydro power plants are [[micro hydro]] or [[pico hydro]] plants.

Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. For countries having the [[List of countries by electricity production from renewable sources|largest percentage]] of electricity from renewables, the top 50 are primarily hydroelectric. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity stations larger than 10&amp;nbsp;GW: the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, [[Itaipu Dam]] across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and [[Guri Dam]] in Venezuela.&lt;ref name=wi2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |title=Use and Capacity of Global Hydropower Increases |last=Institute |first=Worldwatch |date=January 2012 |website= |access-date=18 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924062448/http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |archive-date=24 September 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wave power]], which captures the energy of ocean surface waves, and [[tidal power]], converting the energy of tides, are two forms of hydropower with future potential; however, they are not yet widely employed commercially. A demonstration project operated by the [[Ocean Renewable Power Company]] on the coast of [[Maine]], and connected to the grid, harnesses tidal power from the [[Bay of Fundy]], location of world's highest tidal flow. [[Ocean thermal energy conversion]], which uses the temperature difference between cooler deep and warmer surface waters, currently has no economic feasibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Does Ocean Wave Power Work?|url=https://energyinformative.org/wave-energy/|work=Energy Informative|accessdate=27 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top five trends in wave power|url=https://www.power-technology.com/features/wave-power-energy/|last=Unwin|first=Jack|date=12 March 2019|accessdate=27 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solar energy]], radiant [[light]] and [[heat]] from the [[sun]], is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as [[solar heating]], [[photovoltaics]], [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP), [[concentrator photovoltaics]] (CPV), [[solar architecture]] and [[artificial photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=ie11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Fuels and Artificial Photosynthesis|work=Royal Society of Chemistry |year=2012 |url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Policy/Documents/solar-fuels.asp|accessdate= 11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either [[passive solar]] or [[active solar]] depending on the way they capture, convert, and distribute solar energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable [[thermal mass]] or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that [[Ventilation (architecture)|naturally circulate air]]. Active solar technologies encompass [[solar thermal energy]], using [[Solar thermal collector|solar collectors]] for heating, and [[solar power]], converting [[sunlight]] into [[electricity]] either directly using [[photovoltaics]] (PV), or indirectly using [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP).

A [[photovoltaic system]] converts light into electrical [[direct current]] (DC) by taking advantage of the [[photoelectric effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Sources: Solar|url=https://www.energy.gov/energysources/solar.htm|work=Department of Energy|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solar PV has turned into a multi-billion, [[growth of photovoltaics|fast-growing]] industry, continues to improve its cost-effectiveness, and has the most potential of any renewable technologies together with CSP.&lt;ref&gt;NREL.gov [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/51946.pdf U.S. Renewable Energy Technical Potentials: A GIS-Based Analysis], July 2013 {{rp|iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;thinkprogress.org [http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/07/30/606271/national-renewable-energy-laboratory-solar-has-the-most-potential-of-any-renewable-energy-source/ National Renewable Energy Laboratory: Solar Has The Most Potential Of Any Renewable Energy Source] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122225836/http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/07/30/606271/national-renewable-energy-laboratory-solar-has-the-most-potential-of-any-renewable-energy-source/ |date=22 January 2015 }}, 30 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrated solar power (CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. [[Dish stirling|CSP-Stirling]] has by far the highest efficiency among all solar energy technologies.

In 2011, the [[International Energy Agency]] said that "the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries' energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance [[sustainability]], reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating [[climate change]], and keep [[fossil fuel]] prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared".&lt;ref name=ie11&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf |title=Solar Energy Perspectives: Executive Summary |year=2011 |publisher=International Energy Agency |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113032718/http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf |archivedate=13 January 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy has the largest proportion of solar electricity in the world; in 2015, solar supplied 7.7% of electricity demand in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Italian Solar Renaissance|url=https://www.enelgreenpower.com/media/news/d/2018/06/the-italian-solar-renaissance-|work=Enel Green Power|date=22 June 2018|accessdate=22 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422234207/https://www.enelgreenpower.com/media/news/d/2018/06/the-italian-solar-renaissance-|archive-date=22 April 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, after another year of rapid growth, solar generated approximately 2% of global power, or 460 TWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar energy|url=https://www.iea.org/topics/renewables/solar/|work=IEA|accessdate=22 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geothermal energy ===
{{Main|Geothermal energy|Geothermal electricity|Renewable thermal energy}}
[[File:NesjavellirPowerPlant edit2.jpg|thumb|Steam rising from the [[Nesjavellir Geothermal Power Station]] in Iceland]]
Global geothermal capacity in 2017 was 12.9&amp;nbsp;GW.&lt;ref name="IRENA2018" /&gt;

High temperature geothermal energy is from [[thermal energy]] generated and stored in the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the [[temperature]] of matter. Earth's geothermal energy originates from the original formation of the planet and from [[radioactive decay]] of minerals (in currently uncertain&lt;ref name=Dye&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dye | first1 = S. T. | year = 2012 | title = Geoneutrinos and the radioactive power of the Earth | url = | journal = Reviews of Geophysics | volume = 50 | issue = 3| page = 3 | doi=10.1029/2012rg000400 | bibcode=2012RvGeo..50.3007D| arxiv = 1111.6099}}&lt;/ref&gt; but possibly roughly equal&lt;ref name=Gando&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gando | first1 = A. | last2 = Dwyer | first2 = D.

The [[geothermal gradient]], which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of [[heat]] from the core to the surface. The adjective ''geothermal'' originates from the Greek roots ''geo'', meaning earth, and ''thermos'', meaning heat.

The heat that is used for geothermal energy can be from deep within the Earth, all the way down to Earth's core&amp;nbsp;– {{convert|4,000|mi}} down. At the core, temperatures may reach over 9,000&amp;nbsp;°F (5,000&amp;nbsp;°C). Heat conducts from the core to surrounding rock. Extremely high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt, which is commonly known as magma. Magma convects upward since it is lighter than the solid rock. This magma then heats rock and water in the crust, sometimes up to {{convert|700|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nemzer |first=J |title=Geothermal heating and cooling |url=http://www.geothermal.marin.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980111021839/http://geothermal.marin.org/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=1998-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low temperature geothermal&lt;ref name="energy.gov"/&gt; refers to the use of the outer crust of the Earth as a [[thermal battery]] to facilitate [[renewable thermal energy]] for heating and cooling buildings, and other refrigeration and industrial uses. In this form of geothermal, a [[geothermal heat pump]] and [[ground-coupled heat exchanger]] are used together to move heat energy into the Earth (for cooling) and out of the Earth (for heating) on a varying seasonal basis. Low temperature geothermal (generally referred to as "GHP") is an increasingly important renewable technology because it both reduces total annual energy loads associated with heating and cooling, and it also flattens the electric demand curve eliminating the extreme summer and winter peak electric supply requirements. Thus low temperature geothermal/GHP is becoming an increasing national priority with multiple tax credit support&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsireusa.org/|title=Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency® - DSIRE|website=DSIRE}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focus as part of the ongoing movement toward net zero energy.&lt;ref name="Net Zero Foundation"/&gt;

Biomass is [[Biomaterial|biological material]] derived from living, or recently living organisms. It most often refers to plants or plant-derived materials which are specifically called [[lignocellulosic biomass]].&lt;ref name="Biomass Energy Center"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061008081905/http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=76,15049&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL Biomass Energy Center].

Retrieved on 28 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of [[biofuel]]. Conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into: ''thermal'', ''chemical'', and ''biochemical'' methods. Wood remains the largest biomass energy source today;&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303740704577524822063133842|title=Log In|website=online.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; examples include forest residues – such as dead trees, branches and [[tree stump]]s –, yard clippings, wood chips and even [[municipal solid waste]]. In the second sense, biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial [[Chemical industry|chemicals]], including [[biofuel]]s.

[[Biofuel]]s include a wide range of fuels which are derived from [[biomass]]. The term covers [[Biofuels#Solid biofuels|solid]], [[Biofuels#Ethanol|liquid]], and [[Biofuels#Biogas|gaseous]] fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.apenergy.2009.04.036| title = Political, economic and environmental impacts of biofuels: A review| year = 2009| last1 = Demirbas | first1 = A.| journal = Applied Energy| volume = 86| pages = S108–S117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Liquid biofuels include bioalcohols, such as bioethanol, and oils, such as biodiesel. Gaseous biofuels include [[biogas]], [[landfill gas]] and [[synthetic gas]].

With advanced technology being developed, cellulosic biomass, such as trees and grasses, are also used as feedstocks for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[Ethanol fuel in the United States|United States]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]]. The energy costs for producing bio-ethanol are almost equal to, the energy yields from bio-ethanol. However, according to the [[European Environment Agency]], biofuels do not address global warming concerns.&lt;ref name=eea-biofuels&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/about-us/governance/scientific-committee/sc-opinions/opinions-on-scientific-issues/sc-opinion-on-greenhouse-gas |title=Opinion of the EEA Scientific Committee on Greenhouse Gas Accounting in Relation to Bioenergy |accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biodiesel is made from [[vegetable oil]]s, [[animal fat]]s or recycled greases. It can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, or more commonly as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe. Biofuels provided 2.7% of the world's transport fuel in 2010.&lt;ref name=ren212011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=REN21 |year=2011 |pages=13–14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513045354/http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |archivedate=13 May 2012 |author-link=REN21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biomass, biogas and biofuels are burned to produce heat/power and in doing so harm the environment. Pollutants such as sulphurous oxides (SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrous oxides (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), and particulate matter (PM) are produced from the combustion of biomass; the World Health Organisation estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/|title=WHO - 7 million premature deaths annually linked to air pollution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomass combustion is a major contributor.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/ |title=WHO - Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104165807/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/ |archivedate=4 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs292/en/|title=WHO - Household air pollution and health|website=Who.int|accessdate=26 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integration into the energy system ==
{{Main|Variable renewable energy}}
Renewable energy production from some sources such as wind and solar is more variable and more geographically spread than technology based on fossil fuels and nuclear. While integrating it into the wider energy system is feasible, it does lead to some additional challenges. In order for the energy system to remain stable, a set of measurements can be taken. Implementation of energy storage, using a wide variety of renewable energy technologies, and implementing a [[smart grid]] in which energy is automatically used at the moment it is produced can reduce risks and costs of renewable energy implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|IPCC|2011|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some locations, individual households can opt to purchase renewable energy through a [[consumer green energy program]].

===Electrical energy storage===
{{main|Energy storage|Grid energy storage}}
Electrical energy storage is a collection of methods used to store electrical energy. Electrical energy is stored during times when production (especially from intermittent sources such as [[wind power]], [[tidal power]], [[solar power]]) exceeds consumption, and returned to the [[power grid|grid]] when production falls below consumption. [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] accounts for more than 90% of all grid power storage. Costs of [[lithium-ion batteries]] are dropping rapidly, and are increasingly being deployed grid [[ancillary services]] and for domestic storage.

From the end of 2004, worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60% annually for many technologies. In 2015 global investment in renewables rose 5% to $285.9 billion, breaking the previous record of $278.5 billion in 2011. 2015 was also the first year that saw renewables, excluding large hydro, account for the majority of all new power capacity (134&amp;nbsp;GW, making up 53.6% of the total). Of the renewables total, wind accounted for 72&amp;nbsp;GW and solar photovoltaics 56&amp;nbsp;GW; both record-breaking numbers and sharply up from 2014 figures (49&amp;nbsp;GW and 45&amp;nbsp;GW respectively). In financial terms, solar made up 56% of total new investment and wind accounted for 38%.

In 2014 global [[wind power]] capacity expanded 16% to 369,553 MW.&lt;ref name="GWEG-2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwec.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GWEC_GlobalWindStats2014_FINAL_10.2.2015.pdf |title=GWEC Global Wind Statistics 2014 |date=10 February 2015 |publisher=GWEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yearly wind energy production is also growing rapidly and has reached around 4% of worldwide electricity usage,&lt;ref name=wwea2014&gt;{{cite book |author=The World Wind Energy Association |title=2014 Half-year Report |year=2014|pages=1–8 |publisher=WWEA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 11.4% in the EU,&lt;ref name=EWEA2015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewea.org/fileadmin/files/library/publications/statistics/EWEA-Annual-Statistics-2015.pdf|title=Wind in power: 2015 European statistics- EWEA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is widely used in [[Wind power in China|Asia]], and the [[Wind power in the United States|United States]].

[[Renewable energy in Brazil|Brazil]] has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world, involving production of [[ethanol fuel]] from sugar cane, and ethanol now provides 18% of the country's automotive fuel. Ethanol fuel is also widely available in the United States.

In 2017, investments in renewable energy amounted to US$279.8 billion worldwide, with China accounting for US$126.6 billion or 45% of the global investments, the US for US$40.5 billion, and Europe for US$40.9 billion.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"/&gt; The results of a recent review of the literature concluded that as [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emitters begin to be held liable for damages resulting from GHG emissions resulting in climate change, a high value for liability mitigation would provide powerful incentives for deployment of renewable energy technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heidari|first1=Negin|last2=Pearce|first2=Joshua M.|year=2016|title=A Review of Greenhouse Gas Emission Liabilities as the Value of Renewable Energy for Mitigating Lawsuits for Climate Change Related Damages|url=https://www.academia.edu/19418589|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=55C|issue=|pages=899–908|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2015.11.025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy technologies are getting cheaper, through technological change and through the benefits of mass production and market competition. A 2018 report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), found that the cost of renewable energy is quickly falling, and will likely be equal to or less than the cost non-renewables such as fossil fuels by 2020. The report found that solar power costs have dropped 73% since 2010 and onshore wind costs have dropped by 23% in that same timeframe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Renewable Energy Will Be Consistently Cheaper Than Fossil Fuels By 2020, Report Claims|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2018/01/13/renewable-energy-cost-effective-fossil-fuels-2020/#28c56e054ff2|last=Dominic|first=Dominic|magazine=Forbes|date=13 January 2018|accessdate=18 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current projections concerning the future cost of renewables vary however. The EIA has predicted that almost two thirds of net additions to power capacity will come from renewables by 2020 due to the combined policy benefits of local pollution, decarbonisation and energy diversification.

According to a 2018 report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, wind and solar power are expected to generate roughly 50% of the world's energy needs by 2050, while coal powered electricity plants are expected to drop to just 11%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Energy Outlook 2018|url=https://bnef.turtl.co/story/neo2018?teaser=true|publisher=Bloomberg|work=Bloomberg New Energy Finance|accessdate=18 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hydro-electricity and geothermal electricity produced at favourable sites are now the cheapest way to generate electricity. Renewable energy costs continue to drop, and the levelised cost of electricity ([[LCOE]]) is declining for wind power, solar photovoltaic ([[Photovoltaics|PV]]), concentrated solar power ([[Concentrated solar power|CSP]]) and some biomass technologies.&lt;ref name=irena111&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/Overview_Renewable%20Power%20Generation%20Costs%20in%202012.pdf |title=Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2012: An Overview |author=International Renewable Energy Agency |year=2012 |website=irena.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid-connected capacity in areas with good resources. As the cost of renewable power falls, the scope of economically viable applications increases. Renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity. Where "oil-fired generation is the predominant power generation source (e.g. on islands, off-grid and in some countries) a lower-cost renewable solution almost always exists today".&lt;ref name=irena111/&gt; A series of studies by the US [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] modeled the "grid in the Western US under a number of different scenarios where intermittent renewables accounted for 33 percent of the total power." In the models, inefficiencies in cycling the fossil fuel plants to compensate for the variation in solar and wind energy resulted in an additional cost of "between $0.47 and $1.28 to each MegaWatt hour generated"; however, the savings in the cost of the fuels saved "adds up to $7 billion, meaning the added costs are, at most, two percent of the savings."&lt;ref name=ArsTechnica&gt;

=== Trends for individual technologies ===

==== Hydroelectricity ====
In 2017 the world renewable hydropower capacity was 1,154&amp;nbsp;GW.&lt;ref name="IRENA2018" /&gt; Only a quarter of the worlds estimated hydroelectric potential of 14,000 TWh/year has been developed, the regional potentials for the growth of hydropower around the world are, 71% Europe, 75% North America, 79% South America, 95% Africa, 95% Middle East, 82% Asia Pacific. However, the political realities of new reservoirs in western countries, economic limitations in the third world and the lack of a transmission system in undeveloped areas, result in the possibility of developing 25% of the remaining potential before 2050, with the bulk of that being in the Asia Pacific area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/hydropower_essentials.pdf|title=Renewable Energy Essentials : Hydropower|website=Iea.org|accessdate=26 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329132409/http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/hydropower_essentials.pdf|archive-date=29 March 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is slow growth taking place in Western counties,{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} but not in the conventional dam and reservoir style of the past.

Recent technological advances have expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are usually much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels. As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate [[global warming]] if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels.

Renewable energy technology has sometimes been seen as a costly luxury item by critics, and affordable only in the affluent developed world. This erroneous view has persisted for many years, however between 2016 and 2017, investments in renewable energy were higher in developing countries than in developed countries, with China leading global investment with a record 126.6 billion dollars.

Technology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power: the approximately 1.3 billion people around the world who don't have access to grid electricity. Even though they are typically very poor, these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps. Solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/39544/?p1=MstCom |title=In the Developing World, Solar Is Cheaper than Fossil Fuels |last=Bullis |first=Kevin |date=27 January 2012 |work=Technology Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, an estimated 3 million households get power from small solar PV systems.&lt;ref name=re10&gt;REN21 (2010).

Some [[Small Island Developing States]] (SIDS) are also turning to solar power to reduce their costs and increase their sustainability.

Micro-hydro configured into mini-grids also provide power. Over 44 million households use [[biogas]] made in household-scale digesters for [[lighting]] and/or [[cooking]], and more than 166 million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves.&lt;ref name="REN21 2011 14"/&gt; Clean liquid fuel sourced from renewable feedstocks are used for cooking and lighting in energy-poor areas of the developing world.

Renewable energy projects in many developing countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to [[poverty reduction]] by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment. Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting. Renewable energy can also contribute to education, by providing electricity to schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/ren21-1.pdf Energy for Development: The Potential Role of Renewable Energy in Meeting the Millennium Development Goals] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527233918/http://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/ren21-1.pdf |date=27 May 2008 }} pp. 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy ==
Policies to support renewable energy have been vital in their expansion. Where Europe dominated in establishing energy policy in early 2000s, most countries around the world now have some form of energy policy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/topics/renewables/policies/|title=Policies|website=www.iea.org|access-date=2019-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Renewable Energy Agency]] (IRENA) is an [[intergovernmental organization]] for promoting the adoption of renewable energy worldwide. It aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate [[capacity building]] and technology transfer. IRENA was formed in 2009, by 75&amp;nbsp;countries signing the charter of IRENA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irena.org/downloads/Founconf/Signatory_States_20090126.pdf Signatory States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226062317/http://irena.org/downloads/Founconf/Signatory_States_20090126.pdf|date=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2019, IRENA has 160&amp;nbsp;member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irena.org/irenamembership|title=IRENA Membership|website=/irenamembership|language=en|access-date=2019-04-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406075718/https://irena.org/irenamembership|archive-date=6 April 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The then United Nations' Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity,&lt;ref name="renewableenergyworld1" /&gt; and in September 2011 he launched the UN [[Sustainable Energy for All]] initiative to improve energy access, efficiency and the deployment of renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/nov/02/human-development-report-renewable-energy|title=UN calls for universal access to renewable energy|last=Tran|first=Mark|date=2 November 2011|work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 [[Paris Agreement]] on climate change motivated many countries to develop or improve renewable energy policies.&lt;ref name="ren2017" /&gt; In 2017, a total of 121 countries have adapted some form of renewable energy policy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; National targets that year existed in at 176 countries.&lt;ref name="ren2017" /&gt; In addition, there is also a wide range of policies at state/provincial and local levels.&lt;ref name="ren212011" /&gt; Some [[Public utility|public utilities]] help plan or install [[Home energy upgrades from public utilities|residential energy upgrades]]. Under president [[Barack Obama]], the United States policy encouraged the uptake of renewable energy in line with commitments to the Paris agreement. Even though Trump has abandoned these goals, renewable investment is still on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2018/06/01/u-s-progressing-toward-obamas-climate-goals-despite-trump/|title=Despite Trump, U.S. Progressing Toward Obama's Climate Goals|last=McMahon|first=Jeff|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many national, state, and local governments have created [[Green bank (financial institution)|green banks]]. A green bank is a quasi-public financial institution that uses public capital to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Berlin, Reed Hundt, Marko Muro, and Devashree Saha. "State Clean Energy Banks: New Investment Facilities for Clean Energy Deployment"&lt;/ref&gt; Green banks use a variety of financial tools to bridge market gaps that hinder the deployment of clean energy. The US military has also focused on the use of [[renewable fuels]] for military vehicles. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable fuels can be produced in any country, creating a strategic advantage. The US military has already committed itself to have 50% of its energy consumption come from alternative sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nextnavy.com/air-force-cedes-the-green-lead-and-the-lede-to-navy/ |title=Air Force cedes the Green lead–and the lede–to Navy |first=Craig |last=Hooper |work=nextnavy.com |year=2011 |accessdate=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 100% renewable energy ===
{{update section|date=March 2019}}
{{Main|100% renewable energy}}

The incentive to use 100% renewable energy, for electricity, transport, or even total primary energy supply globally, has been motivated by [[global warming]] and other ecological as well as economic concerns. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. [[Renewable energy commercialization|Renewable energy use]] has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated.&lt;ref name=pg11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/04/100-percent-renewable-vision-building?amp;buffer_share=fdc06 |title=100 Percent Renewable Vision Building |last=Gipe |first=Paul |date=4 April 2013 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply. Also, Professors S. Pacala and [[Robert H. Socolow]] have developed a series of "[[stabilization wedges]]" that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change, and "renewable energy sources," in aggregate, constitute the largest number of their "wedges".&lt;ref name=Pacala&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/mae/people/faculty/socolow/Science-2004-SW-1100103-PAPER-AND-SOM.pdf|title= Stabilization Wedges: Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies |author1=S. Pacala  |author2=R.

Using 100% renewable energy was first suggested in a [[Science (journal)|Science]] paper published in 1975 by Danish physicist [[Bent Sørensen (physicist)|Bent Sørensen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sørensen | first1 = Bent | authorlink = Bent Sørensen (physicist) | year = 1975 | title = A plan is outlined according to which solar and wind energy would supply Denmark's needs by the year 2050 | url = | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 189 | issue = 4199| pages = 255–260 | doi = 10.1126/science.189.4199.255 | pmid=17813696| bibcode = 1975Sci...189..255S }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by several other proposals, until in 1998 the first detailed analysis of scenarios with very high shares of renewables were published. These were followed by the first detailed 100% scenarios. In 2006 a PhD thesis was published by Czisch in which it was shown that in a 100% renewable scenario energy supply could match demand in every hour of the year in Europe and North Africa. In the same year Danish Energy professor [[Henrik Lund (academic)|Henrik Lund]] published a first paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lund | first1 = Henrik | authorlink = Henrik Lund (academic) | year = 2006 | title = Large-scale integration of optimal combinations of PV, wind and wave power into the electricity supply | url = | journal = [[Renewable Energy (journal)|Renewable Energy]] | volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 503–515 | doi = 10.1016/j.renene.2005.04.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he addresses the optimal combination of renewables, which was followed by several other papers on the [[Energy transition|transition]] to 100% renewable energy in Denmark. Since then Lund has been publishing several papers on 100% renewable energy. After 2009 publications began to rise steeply, covering 100% scenarios for countries in Europe, America, Australia and other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hohmeyer | first1 = Olav | last2 = Bohm | first2 = Sönke | year = 2015 | title = Trends toward 100% renewable electricity supply in Germany and Europe: a paradigm shift in energy policies | url = | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Energy and Environment | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 74–97 | doi = 10.1002/wene.128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 [[Mark Z. Jacobson]], professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, and Mark Delucchi published a study on 100% renewable global energy supply in the journal [[Energy Policy (journal)|Energy Policy]]. They found producing all new energy with [[wind power]], [[solar power]], and [[hydropower]] by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be "primarily social and political, not technological or economic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Jacobson: Barriers to 100% Clean Energy are Social and Political, Not Technical or Economic|url=https://www.ecowatch.com/mark-jacobson-barriers-to-100-clean-energy-are-social-and-political-no-1882122292.html|date=20 November 2015|work=Eco Watch|accessdate=10 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also found that energy costs with a wind, solar, water system should be similar to today's energy costs.&lt;ref name=enpol2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/DJEnPolicyPt2.pdf |title=Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part II: Reliability, system and transmission costs, and policies |author1=Mark A.

Similarly, in the United States, the independent National Research Council has noted that "sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change, energy security, and the escalation of energy costs … Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States, taken collectively, can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand."&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12619|title=Electricity from Renewable Resources: Status, Prospects, and Impediments |author=National Research Council| year=2010|page=4|publisher=National Academies of Science|doi=10.17226/12619 |isbn=978-0-309-13708-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political and not technological.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacobson|first=Mark Z.|last2=Delucchi|first2=Mark A.|last3=Cameron|first3=Mary A.|last4=Coughlin|first4=Stephen J.|last5=Hay|first5=Catherine A.|last6=Manogaran|first6=Indu Priya|last7=Shu|first7=Yanbo|last8=Krauland|first8=Anna-Katharina von|date=2019-12-20|title=Impacts of Green New Deal Energy Plans on Grid Stability, Costs, Jobs, Health, and Climate in 143 Countries|url=https://www.cell.com/one-earth/abstract/S2590-3322(19)30225-8|journal=One Earth|language=English|volume=1|issue=4|pages=449–463|doi=10.1016/j.oneear.2019.12.003|bibcode=2019AGUFMPA32A..01J|issn=2590-3330|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/stanford-researchers-have-a-plan-to-tackle-the-climate-emergency|title=Stanford Researchers Have an Exciting Plan to Tackle The Climate Emergency Worldwide|last=Koumoundouros|first=Tessa|date=2019-12-27|website=ScienceAlert|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2013 ''Post Carbon Pathways'' report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: [[climate change denial]], the [[fossil fuels lobby]], political inaction, unsustainable energy consumption, outdated energy infrastructure, and financial constraints.&lt;ref name="John Wiseman et al"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postcarbonpathways.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Post-Carbon-Pathways-Report-2013_Final-V.pdf |title=Post Carbon Pathways |last=Wiseman |first=John |date=April 2013 |work=University of Melbourne |display-authors=etal |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620031627/http://www.postcarbonpathways.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Post-Carbon-Pathways-Report-2013_Final-V.pdf |archivedate=20 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emerging technologies ==

Other renewable energy technologies are still under development, and include [[cellulosic ethanol]], [[hot-dry-rock]] geothermal power, and [[marine energy]].&lt;ref name="IEA"&gt;International Energy Agency (2007).

Many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies, but still depend on attracting sufficient attention and research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D) funding.&lt;ref name="IEA" /&gt;

There are numerous organizations within the academic, federal, and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy. This research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum. Most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Increasing the energy yield of generation from new and renewable energy sources | journal = Renewable Energy | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | year = 2007 | pages = 37–62 |author1=S.C.E.

* [[Cellulosic ethanol]]
: Several refineries that can process biomass and turn it into ethanol are built by companies such as [[Iogen Corporation|Iogen]], [[POET]], and [[Abengoa]], while other companies such as the [[Verenium Corporation]], [[Novozymes]], and Dyadic International&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dyadic.com/|title=Dyadic International - Bioenergy, Biopharmaceutical Enzymes}}&lt;/ref&gt; are producing enzymes which could enable future [[Cellulosic ethanol commercialization|commercialization]].

* [[Marine energy]]
[[File:Rance tidal power plant.JPG|thumb|[[Rance Tidal Power Station]], France]]

: Marine energy (also sometimes referred to as ocean energy) refers to the energy carried by [[ocean wave]]s, [[tide]]s, [[salinity]], and [[Ocean thermal energy conversion|ocean temperature differences]]. The movement of water in the world's oceans creates a vast store of [[kinetic energy]], or energy in motion. This energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes, transport and industries. The term marine energy encompasses both [[wave power]]{{spaced ndash}}power from surface waves, and [[tidal power]]{{spaced ndash}}obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. [[Reverse electrodialysis]] (RED) is a technology for generating electricity by mixing fresh river water and salty sea water in large power cells designed for this purpose; as of 2016 it is being tested at a small scale (50 kW). [[Offshore wind power]] is not a form of marine energy, as wind power is derived from the [[wind]], even if the [[wind turbine]]s are placed over water. The [[ocean]]s have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations. Ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Carbon Trust, ''Future Marine Energy. Results of the Marine Energy Challenge: Cost competitiveness and growth of wave and tidal stream energy'', January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of land is more expensive, and there are fewer rules and regulations for structures built on bodies of water not used for recreation. Unlike most land-based solar plants, floating arrays can be unobtrusive because they are hidden from public view. They achieve higher efficiencies than PV panels on land, because water cools the panels. The panels have a special coating to prevent rust or corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;Erica Goodemay, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/science/solar-power-floating-on-water.html?_r=0 New Solar Plants Generate Floating Green Power], ''New York Times'', 20 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, the Far Niente Winery in Oakville, California, pioneered the world's first floatovoltaic system by installing 994 solar PV modules with a total capacity of 477&amp;nbsp;kW onto 130 pontoons and floating them on the winery's irrigation pond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Winery-goes-solar-with-Floatovoltaics-3282171.php |title=Winery goes solar with Floatovoltaics |publisher=SFGate |date=29 May 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utility-scale floating PV farms are starting to be built.

* [[Solar-assisted heat pump]]
:A [[heat pump]] is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a "heat sink". Heat pumps are designed to move [[thermal energy]] opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A solar-assisted heat pump represents the integration of a [[heat pump]] and [[Solar thermal collector|thermal solar panels]] in a single integrated system. Typically these two technologies are used separately (or only placing them in parallel) to produce [[Water heating|hot water]].&lt;ref name = ref1&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bine.info/en/publications/themeninfos/publikation/elektrisch-angetriebene-waermepumpen/waermepumpen-plus-solar/ | title = Solar-assisted heat pumps | access-date = 21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pump's evaporator.&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.climatizzazioneconfontirinnovabili.enea.it/index.php/pompe-di-calore-elioassistite | title = Pompe di calore elio-assistite | language = it | access-date = 21 June 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120107065814/http://climatizzazioneconfontirinnovabili.enea.it/index.php/pompe-di-calore-elioassistite | archive-date = 7 January 2012 | url-status=dead | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this system is to get high [[Coefficient of performance|COP]] and then produce energy in a more [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficient]] and less expensive way.

:It is possible to use any type of solar thermal panel (sheet and tubes, roll-bond, heat pipe, thermal plates) or [[Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector|hybrid]] ([[Mono-crystalline silicon|mono]]/[[Polycrystalline silicon|polycrystalline]], [[Thin-film solar cell|thin film]]) in combination with the heat pump. The use of a hybrid panel is preferable because it allows covering a part of the electricity demand of the heat pump and reduce the power consumption and consequently the [[variable cost]]s of the system.
* [[Artificial photosynthesis]]
: Artificial photosynthesis uses techniques including [[nanotechnology]] to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds by splitting water to produce hydrogen and then using carbon dioxide to make methanol.&lt;ref&gt;Collings AF and Critchley C (eds). Artificial Photosynthesis{{spaced ndash}}From Basic Biology to Industrial Application (Wiley-VCH Weinheim 2005) p ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in this field are striving to design molecular mimics of photosynthesis which use a wider region of the solar spectrum, employ catalytic systems made from abundant, inexpensive materials that are robust, readily repaired, non-toxic, stable in a variety of environmental conditions and perform more efficiently allowing a greater proportion of photon energy to end up in the storage compounds, i.e., carbohydrates (rather than building and sustaining living cells).&lt;ref name=faunce&gt;{{cite journal|title=Energy and environment policy case for a global project on artificial photosynthesis |journal= Energy &amp; Environmental Science |publisher=RSC Publishing |doi=10.1039/C3EE00063J |volume=6 |issue=3 |page=695|year=2013 |last1=Faunce |first1=Thomas A. |authorlink2=Wolfgang Lubitz |last2=Lubitz |first2=Wolfgang |last3=Rutherford |first3=A.

* [[Algae fuels]]
: Producing liquid fuels from oil-rich varieties of algae is an ongoing research topic. Various microalgae grown in open or closed systems are being tried including some system that can be set up in brownfield and desert lands.
* [[Solar aircraft]]
[[File:Solar Impulse SI2 pilote Bertrand Piccard Payerne November 2014.jpg|thumb|In 2016, ''[[Solar Impulse]] 2'' was the first [[solar-powered aircraft]] to complete a [[circumnavigation]] of the world.]]

:An [[electric aircraft]] is an aircraft that runs on [[electric motor]]s rather than [[internal combustion engine]]s, with electricity coming from [[fuel cell]]s, [[solar cell]]s, [[ultracapacitors]], [[power beaming]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/gallery/Photo/Power-Beaming/index.html Power Beaming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217082723/http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/gallery/photo/Power-Beaming/index.html |date=17 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[electric battery|batteries]].

:Currently, flying manned electric aircraft are mostly experimental demonstrators, though many small [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s are powered by batteries. [[Model aircraft#Electric power|Electrically powered model aircraft]] have been flown since the 1970s, with one report in 1957.&lt;ref name="Noth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asl.ethz.ch/research/asl/skysailor/History_of_Solar_Flight.pdf|title=History of Solar Flight|last=Noth|first=André|date=July 2008|work=Autonomous Systems Lab|publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Technology|page=3|accessdate=8 July 2010|location=Zürich|quote=Günter Rochelt was the designer and builder of Solair I, a 16 m wingspan solar airplane ... 21st of August 1983 he flew in Solair I, mostly on solar energy and also thermals, during 5 hours 41 minutes.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201032732/http://www.asl.ethz.ch/research/asl/skysailor/History_of_Solar_Flight.pdf|archivedate=1 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/infographic-timeline-present-and-future-electric-flight|title=Infographic: A Timeline Of The Present And Future Of Electric Flight|date=|work=Popular Science|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first man-carrying electrically powered flights were made in 1973.&lt;ref name=JAWA74&gt;{{cite book |title= Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1974-75|last= Taylor |first= John W R |edition= |year=1974|publisher=Jane's Yearbooks |location= London|isbn=0-354-00502-2|page=573 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2015–2016, a manned, solar-powered plane, [[Solar Impulse 2]], completed a circumnavigation of the Earth.&lt;ref name=Batrawy&gt;{{cite news|author=Batrawy, Aya|date=9 March 2015|url=https://news.yahoo.com/solar-powered-plane-takes-off-flight-around-world-041503078.html| title=Solar-powered plane takes off for flight around the world|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Solar updraft tower]]
: The Solar updraft tower is a renewable-energy [[power plant]] for generating electricity from low temperature solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath a very wide greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall [[chimney]] tower. The resulting [[convection]] causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the [[chimney effect]]. This airflow drives [[wind turbine]]s placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce [[electricity]]. Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation, and may allow development of other applications, such as water extraction or distillation, and agriculture or horticulture. A more advanced version of a similarly themed technology is the [[Vortex engine]] which aims to replace large physical chimneys with a [[vortex]] of air created by a shorter, less-expensive structure.
* [[Space-based solar power]]
: For either photovoltaic or thermal systems, one option is to loft them into space, particularly Geosynchronous orbit. To be competitive with Earth-based solar power systems, the specific mass (kg/kW) times the cost to loft mass plus the cost of the parts needs to be $2400 or less. I.e., for a parts cost plus rectenna of $1100/kW, the product of the $/kg and kg/kW must be $1300/kW or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacejournal.ohio.edu/issue18/thermalpower.html|title=Online Journal of Space Communication|first=Online Journal of Space|last=Communication|website=spacejournal.ohio.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for 6.5&amp;nbsp;kg/kW, the transport cost cannot exceed $200/kg. While that will require a 100 to one reduction, SpaceX is targeting a ten to one reduction, Reaction Engines may make a 100 to one reduction possible.

* Water vapor

Collection of static electricity charges from water droplets on metal surfaces is an experimental technology that would be especially useful in low-income countries with relative air humidity over 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Water vapor in the atmosphere may be prime renewable energy source|url=https://techxplore.com/news/2020-06-vapor-atmosphere-prime-renewable-energy.html|access-date=2020-06-09|website=techxplore.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{update section|date=March 2019}}
{{Main|Renewable energy debate|Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy|Green job}}

Renewable electricity production, from sources such as wind power and solar power, is sometimes criticized for being variable or [[Intermittent power source|intermittent]], but is not true for concentrated solar, geothermal and biofuels, that have continuity. In any case, the [[International Energy Agency]] has stated that deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and, through local generation, contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Energy Agency]] (2007).

There have been "not in my back yard" ([[NIMBY]]) concerns relating to the visual and other impacts of some [[wind farm]]s, with local residents sometimes fighting or blocking construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/080114-wind-energy.html |title=Whatever Happened to Wind Energy? |publisher=LiveScience |date=14 January 2008 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the Massachusetts [[Cape Wind]] project was delayed for years partly because of aesthetic concerns. However, residents in other areas have been more positive. According to a town councilor, the overwhelming majority of locals believe that the [[Ardrossan Wind Farm]] in Scotland has enhanced the area.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gourlay |first=Simon |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/12/windpower.alternativeenergy |title=Wind farms are not only beautiful, they're absolutely necessary |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=17 January 2012 |date=12 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent{{when|date=May 2020}} UK Government document states that "projects are generally more likely to succeed if they have broad public support and the consent of local communities. This means giving communities both a say and a stake".&lt;ref&gt;Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change (2011). [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/48128/2167-uk-renewable-energy-roadmap.pdf UK Renewable Energy Roadmap (PDF)] p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In countries such as Germany and Denmark many renewable projects are owned by communities, particularly through [[cooperative]] structures, and contribute significantly to overall levels of renewable energy deployment.&lt;ref&gt;DTI, [http://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/36247mr_0_0.pdf Co-operative Energy: Lessons from Denmark and Sweden]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Report of a DTI Global Watch Mission, October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris C &amp; Pehnt M, [http://energytransition.de/wp-content/themes/boell/pdf/German-Energy-Transition.pdf German Energy Transition: Arguments for a Renewable Energy Future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403005225/http://energytransition.de/wp-content/themes/boell/pdf/German-Energy-Transition.pdf |date=3 April 2013 }}, Heinrich Böll Foundation, November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The market for renewable energy technologies has continued to grow. [[Climate change]] concerns and increasing in [[green job]]s, coupled with high oil prices, [[peak oil]], oil wars, [[oil spill]]s, promotion of [[electric vehicle]]s and renewable electricity, nuclear disasters and increasing government support, are driving increasing renewable energy legislation, incentives and [[renewable energy commercialization|commercialization]].&lt;ref name="UNEP" /&gt; New government spending, regulation and policies helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better than many other sectors.&lt;ref name="obama"/&gt;

While renewables have been very successful in their ever-growing contribution to electrical power there are no countries dominated by fossil fuels who have a [[Fossil fuel phase-out|plan to stop]] and get that power from renwables. Only Scotland and Ontario have stopped burning coal, largely due to good natural gas supplies. In the area of transportation, fossil fuels are even more entrenched and solutions harder to find.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/media/training/presentations/Day_2_Renewables_5_Transport.pdf|title=Renewable energy in transport|website=Iea.org|accessdate=26 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412100930/https://www.iea.org/media/training/presentations/Day_2_Renewables_5_Transport.pdf|archive-date=12 April 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's unclear if there are failures with policy or renewable energy, but twenty years after the Kyoto Protocol fossil fuels are still our primary energy source and consumption continues to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html|title=Statistical Review of World Energy - Home - BP|website=BP global}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geopolitics of renewable energy ==
{{expand section|date=March 2019}}
From around 2010 onwards, there was increasing discussion about the geopolitical impact of the growing use of renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317954274|title=The Geopolitics of Renewable Energy|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2019-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was argued that former fossil fuels exporters would experience a weakening of their position in international affairs, while countries with abundant sunshine, wind, hydropower, or geothermal resources would be strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281774890|title=Future Petroleum Geopolitics: Consequences of Climate Policy and Unconventional Oil and Gas|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2019-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also countries rich in critical materials for renewable energy technologies were expected to rise in importance in international affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Overland|first=Indra|date=2019-03-01|title=The geopolitics of renewable energy: Debunking four emerging myths|url= |journal=Energy Research &amp; Social Science|volume=49|pages=36–40|doi=10.1016/j.erss.2018.10.018|issn=2214-6296|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GeGaLo index of geopolitical gains and losses assesses how the geopolitical position of 156 countries may change if the world fully transitions to renewable energy resources. Former fossil fuels exporters are expected to lose power, while the positions of former fossil fuel importers and countries rich in renewable energy resources is expected to strengthen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Overland |first=Indra |last2=Bazilian |first2=Morgan|last3=Ilimbek Uulu| first3=Talgat |last4=Vakulchuk |first4=Roman |last5=Westphal |first5=Kirsten |date=2019|title=The GeGaLo index: Geopolitical gains and losses after energy transition|journal=Energy Strategy Reviews|language=en|volume=26|pages=100406|doi=10.1016/j.esr.2019.100406|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{expand section|date=March 2019}}
{{Main|Renewable Heat Incentive scandal|Operation Car Wash|Biomass#Environmental damage}}
The ability of [[biomass]] and [[biofuels]] to contribute to a reduction in {{CO2}} emissions is limited because both biomass and biofuels emit large amounts of air pollution when burned and in some cases compete with food supply. Furthermore, biomass and biofuels consume large amounts of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12039&amp;page=45 |title =Water Issues of Biofuel Production Plants |author=The National Academies Press |year=2008|accessdate = 31 March 2017 |journal=The National Academies Press|doi =10.17226/12039 |isbn =978-0-309-11361-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other renewable sources such as [[wind power]], [[photovoltaics]], and [[hydroelectricity]] have the advantage of being able to conserve water, lower pollution and reduce {{CO2}} emissions. 
The installations used to produce wind, solar and hydro power are an increasing threat to key conservation areas, with facilities built in areas set aside for nature conservation and other environmentally sensitive areas. They are often much larger than fossil fuel power plants, needing areas of land up to 10 times greater than coal or gas to produce equivalent energy amounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McGrath |first1=Matt |title=Climate change: Green energy plant threat to wilderness areas |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52023881 |publisher=bbc.com |date=25 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 2000 renewable energy facilities are built, and more are under construction, in areas of environmental importance and threaten the habitats of plant and animal species across the globe.
