{{main|Sample-return mission}}

A '''Mars Sample-Return''' ('''MSR''') mission would be a [[spaceflight]] mission to collect rock and dust samples on [[Mars]] and then [[sample-return mission|return them]] to [[Earth]]. Sample-return would be a very powerful type of exploration, because the analysis is freed from the time, budget, and space constraints of spacecraft sensors.&lt;ref name=mars&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/decadal/captem/AllanTreimanMars.pdf Treiman, et al. – Groundbreaking Sample Return from Mars: The Next Giant Leap in Understanding the Red Planet]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Louis Friedman]], Executive Director of [[The Planetary Society]], a Mars sample-return mission is often described by the planetary science community as one of the most important robotic space missions, due to its high expected scientific return on investment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/2013decadal/|title=Science Strategy – NASA Solar System Exploration|publisher=|access-date=2012-08-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721054020/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/2013decadal/|archive-date=2011-07-21|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its ability to prove the technology needed for a [[human mission to Mars]].

Over time, several concept missions have been studied, but none of them got beyond the study phase. The three latest concepts for an MSR mission are a NASA-ESA proposal, a Russian proposal ([[Mars-Grunt]]), and a Chinese proposal.

==Scientific value==
[[File:Martian Meteoritses (15651719446).jpg|thumb|400px|Mars meteorites in the [[Natural History Museum, Vienna|Natural History Museum]] in Vienna]]

The return of Mars samples would benefit science by allowing more extensive analysis to be undertaken of the samples than could be done by instruments painstakingly transferred to Mars. Also, the presence of the samples on Earth would allow scientific equipment to be used on stored samples, even years and decades after the sample-return mission.&lt;ref name="FUT"&gt;[http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/future/futureMissions.html Mars Sample-Return] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518010223/http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/future/futureMissions.html |date=2008-05-18}} (from the [[NASA]] website. Accessed 2008-05-26.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group|MEPAG]] identified 55 important future science investigations related to the exploration of Mars. In 2008, they concluded that about half of the investigations "could be addressed to one degree or another by MSR", making MSR "the single mission that would make the most progress towards the entire list" of investigations. Moreover, it was found that a significant fraction of the investigations cannot be meaningfully advanced without returned samples.&lt;ref name="iMARS"/&gt;

One source of Mars samples is what are thought to be [[Martian meteorite]]s, which are rocks ejected from Mars that made their way to Earth. Of over 61,000 [[meteorite]]s that have been found on Earth, 132 were identified as Martian {{as of|2014|3|3|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/metbull.php?code=54565 NWA 6963]&lt;/ref&gt; These meteorites are thought to be from Mars because they have elemental and isotopic compositions that are similar to rocks and atmosphere gases analyzed by spacecraft on Mars.&lt;ref name=pass48_12-14&gt;{{cite journal|last=Treiman|first=A.H.|display-authors=etal|title=The SNC meteorites are from Mars|journal=Planetary and Space Science|volume=48|issue=12–14|date=October 2000|pages=1213–1230|bibcode=2000P&amp;SS...48.1213T|doi=10.1016/S0032-0633(00)00105-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the possibility of [[life on Mars]] was questioned again when apparent microfossils might have been found in a Mars meteorite (see [[ALH84001]]).&lt;ref name="www2.jpl.nasa.gov"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/snc/nasa3.html|title=Mars Program Gears up for Sample Return Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a renewed interest in a Mars sample-return, and several different [[Spaceflight mission architecture|architectures]] were considered.&lt;ref name="www2.jpl.nasa.gov"/&gt; NASA administrator Goldin laid out three options for MSR: "paced", "accelerated", and "aggressive".&lt;ref name="www2.jpl.nasa.gov"/&gt; It was thought that MSR could be done for less than US$100 million per year, with something similar to then-current Mars exploration budgets.&lt;ref name="www2.jpl.nasa.gov"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mars In-Situ Resource UtilizationSample Return MISR.jpg|thumb|400px|Artist concept of a Mars sample-return mission, 1993]]
For at least three decades, Western scientists have advocated the return of geological samples from Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/docs/Vision_and_Voyages-FINAL.pdf|title=Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013–2022|publisher=National Academies Press|date=2011|page=6‑21|author1=Space Studies Board|author2=National Research Council|authorlink2=United States National Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; One concept was studied with the [[Sample Collection for Investigation of Mars]] (SCIM) proposal, which involved sending a spacecraft in a grazing pass through Mars upper atmosphere to collect dust and air samples without landing or orbiting.&lt;ref name="USRA-2008"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jones, S.M.|display-authors=etal|title=Ground Truth From Mars (2008) – Mars Sample Return at 6 Kilometers per Second: Practical, Low Cost, Low Risk, and Ready|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/msr2008/pdf/4020.pdf|date=2008|publisher=[[Universities Space Research Association|USRA]]|accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union considered a Mars sample-return mission, [[Mars 5NM]], in 1975 but it was cancelled due to the repeated failures of the [[N1 (rocket)|N1 rocket]] that would have been used to launch it. A double sample-return mission, [[Mars 5M|Mars 5M (Mars-79)]] planned for 1979, was cancelled due to complexity and technical problems.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

One mission concept (provisionally named simply Mars Sample-Return) was originally considered by NASA's [[Mars Exploration Program]] to return samples by 2008,&lt;ref&gt;''Return to Mars''. ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'', August 1998 issue&lt;/ref&gt; but was cancelled following a review of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marsnews.com/missions/sample_return|title=MarsNews.com :: Mars Sample Return|date=27 February 2015|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227025532/http://www.marsnews.com/missions/sample_return|archivedate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2001, the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) requested mission concepts and proposals from industry-led teams (specifically [[Boeing]], [[Lockheed Martin]], and [[TRW_Inc.|TRW]]). That following winter, JPL made similar requests of certain university [[aerospace engineering]] departments (namely both [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and the [[University of Michigan]]). A decade later, a NASA-ESA concept mission was aborted in 2012.&lt;ref name=msnbc/&gt;

The United States' [[Mars Exploration Program]], formed after ''[[Mars Observer]]''{{'s}} failure in September 1992,&lt;ref name=strategy9520&gt;{{cite web|last=Shirley|first=Donna|title=Mars Exploration Program Strategy: 1995–2020|url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/23620/1/96-0064.pdf|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|accessdate=18 October 2012|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511200249/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/23620/1/96-0064.pdf|archivedate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; supported a Mars sample-return.&lt;ref name=strategy9520/&gt; One example of a mission architecture was the ''Groundbreaking Mars Sample-Return'' by Glenn J. MacPherson in the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/decadal/captem/AllanTreimanMars.pdf Groundbreaking Sample-Return from Mars: The Next Giant Leap in Understanding the Red Planet.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2011, the National Research Council's [[Planetary Science Decadal Survey]], which laid out mission planning priorities for the period 2013–2022 at the request of [[NASA]] and the [[National Science Foundation|NSF]], declared a MSR campaign its highest priority [[Flagship Program|Flagship Mission]] for that period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livestream.com/2011lpsc/video?clipId=pla_18e48f98-4a78-4acc-ad2a-29c7a8ae326c&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it endorsed the proposed [[Mars Astrobiology Explorer-Cacher]] (MAX-C) mission in a "descoped" (less ambitious) form, although this mission plan was officially cancelled in April 2011.

In September 2012, the United States' Mars Program Planning Group endorsed a sample-return after evaluating long-term Mars' plans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacenews.com/civil/120925-mars-planning-group-endorses-sample-return.html Mars Planning Group Endorses Sample-Return.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/691580main_MPPG-Integrated-v13i-Summary%20Report-9-25-12.pdf Summary of the Final Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The key mission requirement for the planned [[Mars 2020|''Perseverance'' rover]] is that it must help prepare NASA for its MSR campaign,&lt;ref name='cost'&gt;{{cite news|url=http://spacenews.com/mars-2020-rover-mission-to-cost-more-than-2-billion/|title=Mars 2020 rover mission to cost more than $2 billion|work=[[SpaceNews]]|first=Jeff|last=Foust|date=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denver Museum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmns.org/museum-blog/Post/?nid=23546|title=NASA Eyes Sample-Return Capability for Post-2020 Mars Orbiter|last=Evans|first=Kim|work=Denver Museum of Nature and Science|date=13 October 2015 |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Planetary Decadal 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/ssbsite/documents/webpage/ssb_059308.pdf|title=Mission Concept Study: Planetary Science Decadal Survey – MSR Orbiter Mission (Including Mars Returned Sample Handling)|publisher=NASA|first=Richard|last=Mattingly|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is needed before any [[Human mission to Mars|crewed mission]] takes place.&lt;ref name="nasa-letapp20121220"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/announcements/Call_for_2020_Mars_Science_Rover-G.pdf|title=Call for ''Letters of Application'' for Membership on the Science Definition Team for the 2020 Mars Science Rover|publisher=NASA|first=Mitch|last=Schulte|date=20 December 2012|id=NNH13ZDA003L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MPPG&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/691580main_MPPG-Integrated-v13i-Summary%20Report-9-25-12.pdf|title=Summary of the Final Report|publisher=NASA{{\}}Mars Program Planning Group|date=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moskowitz&gt;{{cite news |last=Moskowitz |first=Clara |title=Scientists Offer Wary Support for NASA's New Mars Rover|date=5 February 2013|url=http://www.space.com/19606-mars-rover-2020-planetary-science.html|work=Space.com|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such effort would require three additional vehicles: [[Next Mars Orbiter|an orbiter]], a fetch rover, and a Mars ascent vehicle (MAV).

In mid-2006, the International Mars Architecture for the Return of Samples (iMARS) Working Group was chartered by the [[International Mars Exploration Working Group]] (IMEWG) to outline the scientific and engineering requirements of an internationally sponsored and executed Mars sample-return mission in the 2018–2023 time frame.&lt;ref name="iMARS"&gt;http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/reports/iMARS_FinalReport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, [[NASA]] and [[ESA]] established the [[Mars Exploration Joint Initiative]] to proceed with the [[ExoMars]] program, whose ultimate aim is "the return of samples from Mars in the 2020s".&lt;ref name=MEJI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/news/mars-20090708.html|title=NASA and ESA Establish a Mars Exploration Joint Initiative|date=8 July 2009|publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/reports/13117/App%20G%2009_Mars-Sample-Return-Lander.pdf|title=Planetary Science Decadal Survey: MSR Lander Mission|accessdate=2012-08-24|first=Phil|last=Christensen|date= April 2010|work=[[JPL]]|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; ExoMars' first mission would launch in 2018&lt;ref name="FUT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7500371.stm |title=BBC NEWS – Science/Nature – Date set for Mars sample mission|publisher=|date=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; with unspecified missions to return samples in the 2020–2022 time frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Aurora/SEMT8WWIPIF_0.html|title=Mars Sample Return: bridging robotic and human exploration|accessdate=2008-11-18|date=21 July 2008|publisher=European Space Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cancellation of the caching rover [[MAX-C]], and later NASA withdrawal from ExoMars, pushed back a sample-return mission to an undetermined date. Due to budget limitations the MAX-C mission was canceled in 2011, and the overall cooperation in 2012.&lt;ref name=msnbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/48753850|title=International cooperation called key to planet exploration|date=22 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pull-out was described as "traumatic" for the science community.&lt;ref name=msnbc/&gt;

In April 2018, a [[letter of intent]] was signed by NASA and ESA that may provide a basis for a Mars sample-return mission.&lt;ref name="BBC-20180426"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rincon|first=Paul|title=Space agencies intent on mission to deliver Mars rocks to Earth|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-43907326|date=26 April 2018|work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20180426"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff |title=Video (02:22) – Bringing Mars Back To Earth|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ie3-UwPLUho|date=26 April 2018|work=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2019, a mission architecture was proposed to return samples to Earth by 2032:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Foust|first=Jeff|url=https://spacenews.com/mars-sample-return-mission-plans-begin-to-take-shape/|title=Mars sample return mission plans begin to take shape|work=[[SpaceNews]]|date=28 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cowart|first=Justin|url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/2019/nasa-esa-latest-msr-plan.html|title=NASA, ESA Officials Outline Latest Mars Sample Return Plans|work=[[The Planetary Society]]|date=13 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2020, an updated version of the mission was presented.&lt;ref name="SFN-20200420" /&gt;

* The [[Mars 2020|''Perseverance'' rover]] will collect samples and leave them behind on the surface for later retrieval.
* After a launch in July 2026, a lander with a Mars ascent rocket (developed by NASA) and a sample collection rover (developed by ESA) lands near the Mars 2020 rover in August 2028. The new rover collects the samples left behind by Mars 2020 and delivers them to the ascent rocket. If Mars 2020 is still operational it could also deliver samples to the landing site. Once loaded with the samples, the Mars ascent rocket will launch with the sample return canister in spring 2029 and reach a low Mars orbit.
* The ESA-built Earth-return orbiter launches on an [[Ariane 6]] booster in October 2026 and arrives at Mars in 2027, using ion propulsion to gradually lower its orbit to the proper altitude by July 2028. The orbiter will retrieve the canister with the samples in orbit and return it to Earth during the 2031 Mars-to-Earth transfer window.
* The sample return canister, encapsulated within the Earth re-entry module, lands on Earth in spring 2032.

Robot to retrieve Mars rocks |work=BBC News|first=Jonathan|last=Amos|date=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MAV would launch from Mars and enter a 500&amp;nbsp;km orbit and [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]] with a [[Mars 2022 orbiter|new Mars orbiter]].&lt;ref name="Planetary Decadal 2010"/&gt; The sample container would be transferred to an Earth entry vehicle (EEV) which would bring it to Earth, enter the atmosphere under a parachute and hard-land for retrieval and analyses in specially designed safe laboratories.&lt;ref name="Denver Museum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Planetary Decadal 2010"/&gt;

===Two-launches architecture===
In this scenario, the sample-return mission would span two launches at an interval of about four years. The first launch would be for the orbiter, the second for the lander.&lt;ref name="newmsrplan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://futureplanets.blogspot.com/2009/12/new-mars-sample-return-plan.html|title=Future Planetary Exploration: New Mars Sample Return Plan|date=8 December 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lander would include the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV).

===Three-launches architecture===
This concept would have the sample-return mission split into a total of three launches.&lt;ref name="newmsrplan"/&gt; In this scenario, the sample-collection rover (e.g. [[Mars 2020]] rover) would be launched separately to land on Mars first, and carry out analyses and sample collection over a lifetime of at least 500 Sols (Martian days).&lt;ref name=development&gt;[http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/decadal/SamadAHayati.pdf Strategic Technology Development for Future Mars Missions (2013–2022)]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528044137/http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/decadal/SamadAHayati.pdf|date=2010-05-28}} (PDF) 15 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Some years later, a [[Mars 2022 orbiter|Mars orbiter]] would be launched, followed by a lander carrying the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV). The lander would bring a small and simple "fetch rover", whose sole function would be to retrieve the sample containers from the caches left on the surface or directly from the ''Perseverance'' rover, and return them to the lander where it would be loaded onto the MAV for delivery to the orbiter and then be sent to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100227064804/http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2010/02/24/2211442.aspx 'Bringing back Mars life'] ''MSNBC News'', February 24, 2010 by Alan Boyle.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=NASA plans Mars sample-return rover|first=Alexandra|last=Witze|date=15 May 2014|volume=509|issue=7500|pages=272|doi=10.1038/509272a|pmid=24828172| journal=Nature |bibcode=2014Natur.509..272W|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This design would ease the schedule of the whole project, giving controllers time and flexibility to carry out the required operations. Furthermore, the program could rely on the successful landing system developed for the [[Mars Science Laboratory]], avoiding the costs and risks associated with developing and testing yet another landing system from scratch.&lt;ref name="newmsrplan"/&gt; 

===SCIM===
{{Main|Sample Collection for Investigation of Mars}}
[[File:Scim br.jpg|thumb|400px|An artist's concept of SCIM passing through the Martian atmosphere.]]
SCIM (Sample Collection for Investigation of Mars) was a low-cost low-risk Mars sample-return mission design, proposed in the [[Mars Scout Program]].&lt;ref name="USRA-2008"/&gt; SCIM would return dust and air samples without landing or orbiting,&lt;ref name="USRA-2008"/&gt; by dipping through the atmosphere as it collects Mars material.&lt;ref name=scim&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/marsconcepts2012/pdf/4286.pdf Wadhwa, et al. – SCIM (2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; It uses heritage from the successful ''Stardust'' and ''Genesis'' sample-return missions.&lt;ref name=scim/&gt;

===Mars Future Missions===
{{Further|Mars Next Generation}}
Supports the development of the Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission that is planning to enter formulation (Phase A) as early as the summer of FY 2020. In FY 2021, MSR formulation activities include concept and technology development, and early design and studies in support of the Sample Return Lander and the Capture/Containment and Return System. It also supports a study of the facility required for the handling of returned samples. In developing concepts for a Mars Sample Return mission, the future budget supports an estimated MSR launch readiness date of 2026. Also included is funding for potential collaboration with Canada on the Mars Ice Mapper. The Mars Ice Mapper is a remote sensing mission under study intended to map and profile the near-surface (3–15 meters) water ice, particularly that which lies in the mid-latitude regions, in support of future science and exploration missions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/fy2021_congressional_justification.pdf – p. 469 – 10 February 2020&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it is currently unknown whether [[Life on Mars|life forms exist on Mars]], the mission could potentially transfer viable organisms resulting in [[interplanetary contamination|back contamination]]—the introduction of extraterrestrial organisms into [[biosphere|Earth's biosphere]]. The scientific consensus is that the potential for large-scale effects, either through pathogenesis or ecological disruption, is extremely small.&lt;ref name=iMars&gt;http://mepag.nasa.gov/reports/iMARS_FinalReport.pdf Preliminary Planning for an International Mars Sample Return Mission Report of the International Mars Architecture for the Return of Samples (iMARS) Working Group June 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=esf2010_PP&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2013/01/17/ESF_Mars_Sample_Return_backward_contamination_study.pdf European Science Foundation – Mars Sample Return backward contamination – Strategic advice and requirements] {{webarchive| url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602150139/http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2013/01/17/ESF_Mars_Sample_Return_backward_contamination_study.pdf|date=2 June 2016}} July, 2012, {{ISBN|978-2-918428-67-1}} – see Back Planetary Protection section.

Part of the sample-return mission would be to prevent contact between the Martian environment and the exterior of the sample container.&lt;ref name=esf2010_PP/&gt;&lt;ref name=mepag_ppt/&gt; In order to eliminate the risk of parachute failure, the current plan is to use the thermal protection system to cushion the capsule upon impact (at [[terminal velocity]]). The sample container will be designed to withstand the force of the impact.&lt;ref name=mepag_ppt/&gt; To receive the returned samples, NASA proposed a specially designed [[biosafety level|Biosafety Level 4]] containment facility, the Mars Sample-Return Receiving facility (MSRRF).&lt;ref name=samplereceivingfacility&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/pss/presentations/200803/04-Atlas-PPSonMSR.pdf|title=Mars Sample Return Receiving Facility|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not knowing what properties (e.g., size) any Martian organisms might exhibit is a complication in design of such a facility.&lt;ref name=MSRRF-clean-room&gt;{{cite report|title=Mars Sample Return Receiving Facility – A Draft Test Protocol for Detecting Possible Biohazards in Martian Samples Returned to Earth|date=2002|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/pss/presentations/200803/04-Atlas-PPSonMSR.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scientists and engineers, notably [[Robert Zubrin]] of the [[Mars Society]], argued in the [[fringe science|fringe]] ''[[Journal of Cosmology]]'' that contamination risk is functionally zero and there is little need to worry. They cite, among other things, lack of any verifiable incident although trillions of kilograms of material have been exchanged between Mars and Earth due to meteorite impacts.&lt;ref name=Zubrin2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zubrin|first=Robert|year=2010|title=Human Mars Exploration: The Time Is Now|journal=Journal of Cosmology|volume=12|pages=3549–3557 |url=http://journalofcosmology.com/Mars111.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Committee Against Mars Sample Return (ICAMSR) is a small [[advocacy]] group led by Barry DiGregorio, who campaigns against a Mars sample-return mission. While ICAMSR acknowledges a low probability for biohazards, it considers the proposed containment measures insufficient, and unsafe at this stage. ICAMSR is demanding more ''in situ'' studies on Mars first, and preliminary biohazard testing at the International Space Station before the samples are brought to Earth.&lt;ref name=icamsr&gt;[http://www.icamsr.org/protection.html International Committee Against Mars Sample Return].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=woese&gt;Barry E.
