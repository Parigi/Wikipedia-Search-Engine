{{Contains Indic text}}
The '''hamsa''' ([[Sanskrit]]: हंस, ''{{IAST|haṃsa}}'' or ''hansa'') is an [[aquatic bird|aquatic]] [[bird of passage]], which various scholars have interpreted as the [[goose]], the [[swan]],&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;Lindsay Jones (2005), Encyclopedia of religion, Volume 13, Macmillan Reference, {{ISBN|978-0028657332}}, page 8894, Quote: "In Hindu iconography the swan personifies Brahman-Atman, the transcendent yet immanent ground of being, the Self."&lt;/ref&gt; or even the [[flamingo]].&lt;ref name="monier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cush"&gt;Denise Cush (2007), Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415556231}}, page 697&lt;/ref&gt; Its icon is used in Indian and Southeast Asian culture as a spiritual symbol and a decorative element. It is believed by Hindus to be the [[vahana]] (or ''vehicle'') of [[Brahma]], [[Gayatri]], [[Saraswati]], and [[Vishvakarma]].&lt;ref name=cush/&gt;

== Identification ==
Monier Williams translates the term from Sanskrit as "a goose, gander, swan, flamingo (or other aquatic bird, considered as a bird of passage ...)."&lt;ref name="monier"&gt;[[Monier Monier-Williams]], Monier Williams Sanskrit Dictionary, [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/1300/mw__1319.html हंस, Hamsa], [[University of Cologne]], Germany, {{ISBN|978-8120615090}}, page 1286&lt;/ref&gt; The word is also used for a mythical or poetical bird with knowledge. In the [[Rig Veda]], it is the bird which is able to separate Soma from water, when mixed; in later Indian literature, the bird separates milk from water when mixed.&lt;ref name=monier/&gt; In Indian philosophical literature, ''hamsa'' represents the individual soul or spirit (typified by the pure sunlight-white like color of a goose or swan), or the "Universal Soul or Supreme Spirit".&lt;ref name=monier/&gt;

The word ''Hamsa'' is cognate with Latin "(h)anser", Greek "χήν", German "Gans", English "goose", Spanish "ganso" and Russian "гусь".&lt;ref&gt;J. Pokorny, [[Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch]]. *''[http://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/index.htm#ĝhan-s.htm ĝhan-s-]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean Vogel, in 1952, questioned the identification of ''hamsa'' as swan, because swans were rare, at least in modern India, while the bar-headed goose (''[[Anser indicus]]'') were somewhat common.&lt;ref name=vogel/&gt; Some have criticised Vogel's view as being over-reliant on artistic representations from south India and Sri Lanka, where the white swan is rare.  According to Vogel, Western and Indian scholars may have preferred translating ''hamsa'' in Sanskrit text as swan because the indigenous goose appears plump while the swan (and, Vogel adds, the flamingo) appears more graceful. Vogel also rules out the [[ruddy shelduck]] which is unambiguously referred to in Sanskrit as ''Chakravaka''.&lt;ref name=vogel&gt;Jean P Vogel, [https://archive.org/details/TheGooseInIndianLiteratureAndArt ''The Goose in Indian Literature and Art''] (Arts &amp; Letters, Vol. XXVII, 1952; Reprinted Leiden, 1962), pages 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sanskrit and Pali languages, both have alternate words for goose such as ''Jalapada'', ''Dhamara'', ''Cakragki'', ''Majjugamana'', ''Shvetagaruta'' and others.&lt;ref&gt;Maung Tin, ''[http://www.myanmarnet.net/nibbana/books/pali-pmtin.pdf Pali English Dictionary], British Burma Press'', Cornell University Archives&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monier Monier-Williams, ''[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html Monier Williams Sanskrit Dictionary]''. See ''Goose'', [[University of Cologne]], Germany, {{ISBN|978-8120615090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dave states that the hymns of [[Rigveda]], and verses in Hindu Epics and Puranas mention a variety of birds with the root of ''hamsa'' (हंस), such as Maha-hamsa, Raj-hamsa, Kal-hamsa and others, most of which he identifies as swans particularly mute swan, while some refer to geese.&lt;ref name=dave422/&gt; Dave's identification is based on the details provided in the Sanskrit texts about the changes in plumage over the bird's life, voice, migratory habits, courtship rituals and flying patterns.&lt;ref name=dave422&gt;{{cite book|author=Dave, KN |year=2005| title=Birds in Sanskrit Literature|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-8120818422|pages= 422-447}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave cites several Sanskrit works from the Ṛgveda onwards that unambiguously identify the haṃsa as a bird of snowy white plumage. Dave notes that the breeding grounds of various types of swan range from the Caspian to Siberia and Western Turkestan, and that they are seen mainly in Sind, Panjab and sometimes in Nepal and Rajasthan. Some Sanskrit texts, states Dave, distinguish between ''Hamsa'' and ''Kadamb'', the former being [[swan]] and latter a [[bar-headed goose]].&lt;ref name=dave422/&gt; The Indian ornithologist [[Salim Ali]] noted that Raghuvira's (with whom Dave worked) identifications of birds in Sanskrit literature were dubious and often far-fetched. Ali considered Raj-hamsa as the bar-headed and Kadamb as the greylag goose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ali, S.|url=https://archive.org/details/AzadMemorialBirds/page/n22/mode/1up/| title=Bird study in India: Its history and its importance|year=1979| publisher=ICCR|place=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the earliest art in India, up until the early colonial period, does not depict swans, but rather birds that resemble the bar-headed goose. Hence, the birds painted at the Ajanta Caves in the depiction of the Hamsa Jataka resemble the bar-headed goose,&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20171211151602/http://ignca.nic.in:80/jatak002.htm&lt;/ref&gt; which are famous for their yearly migration into the Himalayas, while the text of the Jataka itself clearly describes white swans that are like clouds in a blue sky.

==In Hinduism==
The hamsa is often identified with the Supreme Spirit, Ultimate Reality or [[Brahman]] in [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=jones/&gt; The flight of the hamsa symbolizes [[moksha]], the release from the cycle of [[samsara]].&lt;ref name=bowker&gt;John Bowker (1998), Picturing God, Series Editor: Jean Holm, Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-1855671010}}, pp 99-101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Leviton (2011), Hierophantic Landscapes, {{ISBN|978-1462054145}}, pp 543&lt;/ref&gt;

The hamsa is also the [[vahana]] of [[Saraswati]] – the goddess of knowledge and creative arts, and her husband [[Brahma]] – the god with powers of creation, in Hindu trinity and his other wife [[Gayatri]] - the goddess of vedas(vedmata), one of Adi shakti and her other husband [[Vishvakarma]] - the god of Architect.&lt;ref name=cush/&gt;&lt;ref name=bowker/&gt;

[[Lake Manasarovar]] in Hindu mythology, is seen as the summer abode of the hamsa. Poetical images are derived from the flight of the hamsa to that lake in the [[Himalaya]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kalidasa]]'s maha-kavya ''[[Raghuvaṃśa]]''&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Yoga===
During [[pranayama]], which is a [[Yoga|yogic]] exercise of breath control, hamsa came to epitomize the [[prana]], the breath of life.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Paramahamsa===
{{main|Paramahamsa Upanishad|Hamsa Upanishad}}
In view of the association of a hamsa with several attributes as indicated above, Hindu [[rishi]]s and [[sadhu]]s have been given the title of ''paramahamsa'', that is, the ''supreme hamsa''. It connotes a particular person who has reached a high level of spirituality.{{Sfn|Deussen|1997|pp=717-720}}{{sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp= 137-140}}

For example, ''[[Paramahamsa Upanishad]]'' calls that [[Yogi]] a Paramahamsa who is neither opinionated nor affected by defamation, nor jealous, not a show off, is humble, and is oblivious to all the human frailties. He is immune to the existence of his body, which he treats as a corpse. He is beyond false pretensions and lives realizing the Brahman. In chapter 3, the ''Paramahamsa Upanishad'' states that the one who understands the difference between "staff of knowledge" and "staff of wood", is a [[Paramahamsa]].{{sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp= 137-140}}

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
He does not fear pain, nor longs for pleasure.
He forsakes love. He is not attached to the pleasant, nor to the unpleasant.
He does not hate. He does not rejoice.

Firmly fixed in knowledge, his Self is content, well-established within. 
He is called the true Yogin. He is a knower.

His consciousness is permeated with that, the perfect bliss.
That Brahman I am, he knows it. He has that goal achieved.
&lt;/poem&gt;
| Paramahamsa Upanishad, Chapter 4 (Abridged)|{{sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp= 137-140}}{{Sfn|Deussen|1997|pp=753-755}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_upanishhat/paramahamsa_upan.html?lang=sa|title= परमहंसोपनिषत् |accessdate=7 January 2016|publisher= sanskritdocuments.org|page=॥ ४॥, verse 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Mythology===
Hamsa, or Hansa, are part of Indian mythology. ''Arayanna'', or heavenly hamsa (swans), are said to live in ''Manasasaras'' in the [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref name=george/&gt; They are mentioned in the Hindu Epic, the [[Ramayana]].&lt;ref name=george/&gt; Hamsa, the swan, is part of the mythical love story of Nala and [[Damayanti]], where it carries the stories, historical information and messages between the two strangers.&lt;ref name=george&gt;George Williams (2001), Handbook of Hindu Mythology, {{ISBN|978-1576071069}}, pages 58-59&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indian mythology, it is said to eat pearls and separate milk from water from a mixture of both.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Myers (1999), Music of Hindu Trinidad: Songs from the India Diaspora, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226554532}}, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastern Religious scholar, Alan Watts, stated that the Hindu tradition includes a myth regarding half a Hamsa's eggshell becoming the sky and the other half becoming the earth. A similar egg-sky-earth cosmological story can be found in the Finlandic myths recorded in the Kalevala, where the eggshell of a duck forms the sky and earth.

==Buddhism==
[[Image:CrystalGoose.JPG|thumb|A bird probably a goose [[reliquary]], found in [[Taxila]], [[Gandhara]] (1st century CE). This was found inside a granite bowl, with a gold sheet inscription (now lost). Scholars state the lost inscription read "a relic of the Buddha was placed in the goose reliquary for the benefit of Sira's parents in a future existence". Now at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;British Museum Collection [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=226006&amp;partId=1 Bird, probably a goose, carved in rock crystal.]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The hamsa was also used extensively in the art of [[Gandhara]], in conjunction with images of the [[Shakyamuni Buddha]]. It is also deemed sacred in the [[Buddhadharma]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

== Contemporary usage ==
The name in other languages in which it is culturally important are [[Hindi]]: ''hans'', [[Telugu language|Telugu]]: హంస, ''hamsa'' [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: ''அன்னப்பறவை''; {{lang-km|ហង្ស}}, ''hong''; {{lang-my|ဟင်္သာ}}, {{IPA-my|hɪ́ɰ̃θà|IPA}}, and commonly spelt ''hintha'' or ''hinthar''; {{lang-mnw|ဟံသာ (ၜိုပ်)}}, {{IPA-mnw|hɔŋsa|}} or ''hongsa''; [[Shan language|Shan]]: {{my|ႁင်းသႃႇ}}, {{IPA-shn|haŋ˦ sʰaː˨|}} or ''hangsa''; [[Thai language|Thai]]:  ''hong'' (หงส์), {{IPA-th|hǒŋ|}}; [[Malay language|Malay]]: ''angsa'' (اڠسا‎).

The hintha (hamsa) is widely depicted in Burmese art, considered to be "swan" in its mythology, and has been adopted as the symbol of the [[Mon people]].&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Fraser-Lu (1994), Burmese Crafts: Past and Present, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195886085}}, page 116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Reid and Michael Grosberg (2005), Myanma (Burma), {{ISBN|978-1740596954}}, page 140&lt;/ref&gt;
