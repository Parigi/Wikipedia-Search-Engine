'''Peter Kenneth Frampton''' (born 22 April 1950)&lt;ref name="AllMusic Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.allmusic.com/artist/peter-frampton-mn0000320845/biography|title=Peter Frampton Biography|first=Steve| last=Huey|publisher=[[AllMusic.com]]|accessdate=November 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--cited source, AllMusic.com, also verifies middle name Kenneth--&gt; is an English-American  rock musician, singer, songwriter, producer, and guitarist. He was previously associated with the bands [[Humble Pie]] and [[The Herd (UK band)|the Herd]]. After the end of his 'group' career, as a solo artist, Frampton released several albums including his international breakthrough album, the live release ''[[Frampton Comes Alive!]]''. The album sold more than 8 million copies in the United States and spawned several hit singles.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gold &amp; Platinum |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&amp;se=peter+frampton#search_section |publisher=RIAA|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then he has released several other albums. He has also worked with [[Ringo Starr]], [[the Who]]'s [[John Entwistle]], [[David Bowie]] and both [[Matt Cameron]] and [[Mike McCready]] from [[Pearl Jam]], among others.

Frampton is best known for such hits as "Breaking All the Rules", "[[Show Me the Way (Peter Frampton song)|Show Me the Way]]", "[[Baby, I Love Your Way]]", "[[Do You Feel Like We Do]]", and "[[I'm in You (song)|I'm in You]]", which remain staples on classic rock radio. He has also appeared as himself in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[Madam Secretary (TV series)|Madam Secretary]]''. Frampton is known for his work as a guitar player, particularly with a [[talk box]] and his voice.

==Early life==
Peter Kenneth Frampton was born to Owen and Peggy (née {{Not a typo|ffitch}}&lt;!-- The surname "ffitch" is often spelt with a lowercase initial "f" and the source uses this spelling --&gt;) Frampton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Welch |first1=Chris |title=Owen Frampton |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/owen-frampton-320315.html |accessdate=25 May 2019 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=18 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Beckenham]], Kent, UK.&lt;ref name="AllMusic Bio" /&gt; He attended [[Bromley Technical High School]],&lt;ref name="bromleytech"&gt;Sandford (1997): pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; at which his father, [[Owen Frampton]], was a teacher and the head of the Art department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beckenham.towntalk.co.uk/about/fame/352/Peter-Frampton/ |title=Peter Frampton, Beckenham Hall of Fame|work=Beckenham TownTalk |date=22 April 1950 |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first became interested in music when he was seven years old. Having discovered his grandmother's [[banjolele]] in the attic,&lt;ref name=CNN-Phillips&gt;Interview with Kyra Phillips: – [http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Music/04/05/frampton/ "Frampton: 'It's been a journey'"]. – [[CNN]] – Friday, 9 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; he taught himself to play it, going on to later teach himself how to play guitar and piano as well.  At the age of eight, he began taking classical music lessons.&lt;ref name=60s70s&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frampton.com/70.html |title=Peter Frampton History – 60's/70's |website=Frampton.com |accessdate=11 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016143145/http://www.frampton.com/70.html |archivedate=16 October 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AllMusic-Bio&gt;Huey, Steve. – [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4302|pure_url=yes}} Peter Frampton]. – [[AllMusic]]&lt;/ref&gt;

His early influences were [[Cliff Richard]] &amp; [[the Shadows]] (featuring guitarist [[Hank Marvin]]) and American rockers [[Buddy Holly]] and [[Eddie Cochran]] and later [[the Ventures]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[the Beatles]]. His father introduced him to the recordings of Belgian [[Romani people|gypsy]] [[jazz]] guitarist [[Django Reinhardt]].&lt;ref name=CNN-Phillips /&gt;&lt;ref name=TCE-2001-02-04&gt;Nager, Larry. – [http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2001/02/04/tem_no_fade_in_framptons.html "No fade in Frampton's future"]. – ''[[Cincinnati Enquirer]]''. – 4 February 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
===Early bands===
By the age of 12, Frampton played in a band called the Little Ravens. Both he and [[David Bowie]], who was three years older, were pupils at [[Bromley]] Technical School (where his father Owen Frampton was Bowie's art instructor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Gosling|first1=Emily|title=Teaching David Bowie|url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/may-2012/teaching-david-bowie/|accessdate=1 January 2017|magazine=Design Week|date=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Little Ravens played on the same bill at school as Bowie's band, George and the Dragons.&lt;ref name=60s70s /&gt; Peter and David would spend lunch breaks together, playing Buddy Holly songs.&lt;ref name=60s70s /&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyMail"&gt;Buxton, John. – "Answers to Correspondents". – [[Daily Mail|''London Daily Mail'']] – p.64. – 19 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 14, Peter was playing with a band called the Trubeats followed by a band called the Preachers, produced and managed by [[Bill Wyman]] of [[the Rolling Stones]].&lt;ref name=60s70s /&gt;

He became a successful child singer, and in 1966 he became a member of [[The Herd (UK band)|the Herd]]. He was the lead guitarist and singer, scoring several British pop hits. Frampton was named "The Face of 1968" by [[teen magazine]] ''Rave''.&lt;ref name=60s70s /&gt;&lt;ref name=TCE-2001-02-04 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TCE-50&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2001/02/04/tem_50_years_of_peter.html |title=50 years of Peter Frampton |website=Enquirer.com |date=4 February 2001 |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, when Frampton was 18 years old, he joined with [[Steve Marriott]] of [[Small Faces]] to form [[Humble Pie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Slice of Humble Pie: Peter Frampton's Underrated Band Deserves Another Listen|url=https://www.howardstern.com/show/2016/2/24/8-slices-peter-framptons-humble-pie/|website=Howard Stern|publisher=The Howard Stern Production Company, Inc.|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While playing with Humble Pie, Frampton also did session recording with other artists, including: [[Harry Nilsson]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]],  and [[John Entwistle]]'s ''[[Whistle Rymes]]'', in 1972.&lt;ref name=TCE-50 /&gt; [[Pete Drake]] introduced him to the "[[talk box]]" that was to become one of his trademark guitar effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Giles|first1=Jeff|title=How Peter Frampton Met the Talk Box|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/peter-frampton-talk-box/|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lux, Joanna. and David Dayen. – [http://www.g4tv.com/techtvvault/features/30669/Peter_Frampton_More_Alive_Than_Ever.html "Peter Frampton: More Alive Than Ever"]. – [[G4 Media]]. – 13 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lovelady, Nicholas. – [http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~ni900332/ "Frampton and the Talkbox"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012184009/http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~ni900332/ |date=12 October 2007 }}. – [[University of Central Florida]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solo career===
After four studio albums and one live album with [[Humble Pie]], Frampton left the band and went solo in 1971, just in time to see [[Performance Rockin' the Fillmore|''Rockin' the Fillmore'']] rise up the US charts.&lt;ref name=60s70s /&gt; He remained with [[Dee Anthony]] (1926-2009), the same personal manager that Humble Pie had used.&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, Cameron. – "Frampton: Rock Star of the Year". – ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. – 10 February 1977. – RS232.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenblatt, Mike. "Peter Frampton." Goldmine 37, no. 10 (09, 2011): 60-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

His own debut was 1972's ''[[Wind of Change (album)|Wind of Change]]'', with guest artists [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Billy Preston]].&lt;ref name=TCE-2001-02-04 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TCE-50 /&gt; This album was followed by ''[[Frampton's Camel]]'' in 1973, which featured Frampton working within a group project. In 1974, Frampton released ''[[Somethin's Happening]]''. Frampton toured extensively to support his solo career, joined for three years by his former Herd mate [[Andy Bown]] on keyboards, [[Rick Wills]] on bass, and American drummer John Siomos. In 1975, the ''[[Frampton (album)|Frampton]]'' album was released. The album went to No. 32 in the US charts, and is certified [[Gold Album|Gold]] by the [[RIAA]].&lt;ref name=60s70s /&gt;

Peter Frampton had little commercial success with his early albums. This changed with Frampton's best-selling live album, ''[[Frampton Comes Alive!]]'', in 1976, from which "[[Baby, I Love Your Way]]", "[[Show Me the Way (Peter Frampton song)|Show Me the Way]]", and an edited version of "[[Do You Feel Like We Do]]", were hit singles. The latter two tracks also featured his use of the [[talk box]] guitar effect. The album was recorded in 1975, mainly at the [[Winterland|Winterland Ballroom]] in [[San Francisco, California]], where Humble Pie had previously enjoyed a good following. Frampton had a new line-up, with Americans [[Bob Mayo]] on keyboards and rhythm guitar and Stanley Sheldon on bass. Wills had been sacked by Frampton at the end of 1974, and Bown had left on the eve of ''Frampton Comes Alive'', to return to England and new fame with [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]]. ''Frampton Comes Alive'' was released in early January, debuting on the charts on 14 February at number 191. The album was on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] for 97 weeks, of which 55 were in the top 40, of which 10 were at the top. The album beat, among others, [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s ''[[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|Fleetwood Mac]]'' to become the top selling album of 1976, and it was also the 14th best seller of 1977. With sales of eight million copies it became the biggest selling live album, although with others subsequently selling more it is now the fourth biggest. ''Frampton Comes Alive!'' has been certified as eight times platinum.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacyrecordings.com/Peter-Frampton.aspx#]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123182422/http://www.legacyrecordings.com/Peter-Frampton.aspx|date=23 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/frampton_peter/artist.jhtml |title=Peter Frampton &amp;#124; New Music And Songs |publisher=MTV |date=22 April 1950 |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/101306/lif_5535265.shtml |title=Peter Frampton: Still a guitar man |website=Jacksonville.com |date=13 October 2006 |accessdate=11 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311051126/http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/101306/lif_5535265.shtml |archive-date=11 March 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AllMusic-ComesAlive&gt;Eder, Bruce. – [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r7699|pure_url=yes}} ''Frampton Comes Alive!'']. – [[AllMusic]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/searchResult.jsp?configType=BBCOM_SIMPLEDEFAULT&amp;pubList=Billboard&amp;an=bbcom&amp;action=Submit&amp;kw=&amp;exposeNavigation=true&amp;keyword=Frampton+Comes+Alive%21&amp;searchType=ARTICLE_SEARCH&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228085612/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/searchResult.jsp?configType=BBCOM_SIMPLEDEFAULT&amp;pubList=Billboard&amp;an=bbcom&amp;action=Submit&amp;kw=&amp;exposeNavigation=true&amp;keyword=Frampton+Comes+Alive%21&amp;searchType=ARTICLE_SEARCH&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0|date=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/business|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234354/http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=855691|url-status=dead|title=Billboard Business|archivedate=26 September 2007|website=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/business|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929115158/http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=855680|url-status=dead|title=Billboard Business|archivedate=29 September 2007|website=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The album won Frampton a Juno Award in 1977.&lt;ref name="Inc.1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Melhuish|title=Juno 1977 |work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ayMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA76|date=23 April 1977|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=76–|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of ''Frampton Comes Alive!'' put him on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', in a famous shirtless photo by [[Francesco Scavullo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/coverwall/1976#0211 |title=Pictures and Photo Galleries |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frampton later said he regrets the photo because it changed his image as a credible artist into a teen idol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2001/02/04/tem_no_fade_in_framptons.html |title=No fade in Frampton's future |website=Enquirer.com |date=4 February 2001 |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1976, he and manager Dee Anthony visited the [[White House]] at the invitation of [[Steven Ford]], the president's son.&lt;ref&gt;"Random Notes". – 16 December 1976. – RS228.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 August 1979, Frampton received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for his contributions to the recording industry at 6819 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/peter-frampton|title=Peter Frampton {{!}} Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=Walkoffame.com|access-date=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/peter-frampton/|title=Peter Frampton|website=Latimes.com|access-date=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Setbacks====
Frampton's following album, ''[[I'm in You]]'' (1977) contained the hit title single and went platinum, but fell well short of expectations compared to ''[[Frampton Comes Alive!]]''.&lt;ref name=60s70s /&gt;

He starred, with the [[Bee Gees]], in producer [[Robert Stigwood]]'s poorly received film ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1978). Frampton's career seemed to be falling as quickly as it had risen.&lt;ref name=60s70s /&gt;&lt;ref name=TCE-2001-02-04 /&gt; He also played guitar on the [[Grease (song)|title song]] of the 1978 film [[Grease (film)|''Grease'']], a song newly-written for the film by [[Barry Gibb]].

Frampton suffered a near-fatal car accident in the Bahamas in 1978 that marked the end of his prolific period and the beginning of a long fallow period where he was less successful than previously. He returned to the studio in 1979 to record the album ''[[Where I Should Be]]''. Among those contributing to the album were past band members [[Stanley Sheldon]] (bass), [[Bob Mayo]] (keyboards/guitar/vocals), and [[John Siomos]] (drums/vocals).&lt;ref name=60s70s /&gt;&lt;ref name=AllMusic-Bio /&gt;

In 1980, his album ''[[Rise Up (Peter Frampton album)|Rise Up]]'' was released to promote his tour in Brazil, although he suffered another serious setback that year when all his guitars were thought destroyed in a cargo plane crash that killed three people. Among the instruments he lost was the black Les Paul Custom which he had named "Phenix"&lt;ref name=GibsonGuitarGreats&gt;[http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Gibson-Guitar-Greats-Peter-Frampton.aspx Gibson Guitar Greats: Peter Frampton] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916235152/http://www.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Gibson-Guitar-Greats-Peter-Frampton.aspx |date=16 September 2018 }}, at Gibson.com; published 4 April 2017; retrieved 16 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt; (pictured on the cover of ''Frampton Comes Alive'') given to him by Mark Mariana and first used on the night of the recording of the Humble Pie live album ''Performance'', and which he had used all through his early solo career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gibson.com/news-lifestyle/features/en-us/peterframptontalksaboutwan.aspx |title=Gibson Guitars: "Peter Frampton On Wanting to Find a New Guitar, Not Wanting to Be Alive, and Definitely Not Wanting to be Eric Clapton" |website=Gibson.com |date= |accessdate=29 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180130091310/http://www.gibson.com/news-lifestyle/features/en-us/peterframptontalksaboutwan.aspx |archive-date=30 January 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The guitar was recovered and returned to him in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/peter-frampton-reunited-with-best-guitar-after-31-years/?_r=0|title = Peter Frampton Reunited with 'Best Guitar' After 31 Years|first=James C.|last= McKinnley Jr.|date=3 January 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album eventually turned into ''[[Breaking All the Rules (Peter Frampton album)|Breaking All the Rules]]'', released the next year in 1981.

Although his albums generally met with little commercial success, Frampton continued to record throughout the 1980s. He did, however, achieve a brief, moderate comeback of sorts in 1986 with the release of his ''[[Premonition (Peter Frampton album)|Premonition]]'' album, and the single "Lying", which became a big hit on the [[Mainstream Rock]] charts. Most notably, he also united with old friend David Bowie, and both worked together to make albums. Frampton played on Bowie's 1987 album ''[[Never Let Me Down]]'' and sang and played on the accompanying [[Glass Spider Tour]].&lt;ref name=AllMusic-Bio /&gt;&lt;ref name=TCE-2001-02-04 /&gt;&lt;ref name=80s /&gt; Frampton would, in 2013, credit his participation in this tour for helping revive his career.&lt;ref name=AM13&gt;{{Citation | title=David Bowie Helped Revive Peter Frampton | url=http://www.antimusic.com/news/13/January/03David_Bowie_Helped_Revive_Peter_Frampton.shtml | accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking for the band experience again after touring with Bowie, Frampton kept referencing Steve Marriott, and at the beginning of 1991 rejoined his old Humble Pie mate for some shows (Marriott's last English gigs) at the Half Moon in Putney, London. The chemistry was still there for a while, as both Frampton and Marriott laid down some tracks in L.A. and prepared to do a "Frampton-Marriott" tour. However, Marriott abruptly returned to England in April and he died in a house fire less than 24 hours after his return. Broken up by Marriott's death, Frampton went off the road for a time, then reformed his old touring band with his old friends Bob Mayo and John Regan.  At least three songs, and possibly a fourth, from the ended Marriott-Frampton partnership were subsequently recorded; two ending up on Frampton's "Shine On" compilation, a third on his subsequent solo album.

In the late 1990s, he starred in an infomercial plugging the internationally successful eMedia Guitar Method, a piece of instructional software represented as an alternative to taking actual guitar lessons. He claimed in the infomercial that the software was the best way to learn guitar.&lt;ref name=90s&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frampton.com/90.html |title=Peter Frampton History – '90s |website=Frampton.com |accessdate=11 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417143914/http://www.frampton.com/90.html |archivedate=17 April 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Frampton wrote and released the album ''[[Peter Frampton (album)|Peter Frampton]]'', the final version of which contained material recorded on Tascam cassette recorders. Originally released on the Relativity label, this record was re-released in 2000 by Legacy Records, with four bonus tracks and additional notes by Peter.

In 1995, Frampton released ''[[Frampton Comes Alive! II]]'', which contained live versions of many of the songs from his 1980s and 1990s solo albums. ''Frampton Comes Alive! II'' was accompanied by a video release on DVD, recorded at [[The Fillmore]] Theatre on 15 June 1995. Although there was a large amount of marketing for the album, it did not sell well.&lt;ref name=90s /&gt; After ''Frampton Comes Alive! II'', he recorded and toured with [[Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings]] and [[Ringo Starr's All-Starr Band]],&lt;ref name=AllMusic-Bio /&gt; where he and [[Jack Bruce]] performed a cover version of [[Cream (band)|Cream's]] "[[Sunshine of Your Love]]".

[[File:PeterFrampton06.jpg|thumb|right|Frampton performing in September 2006]]
In 2003, Frampton released the album ''[[Now (Peter Frampton album)|Now]]'', and embarked on a tour with [[Styx (band)|Styx]] to support it. It was on this tour in 2004 he lost good friend and long time bandmate [[Bob Mayo]]. He also toured with [[The Elms (band)|the Elms]], and appeared in 2006 on the [[Fox Broadcasting]] variety show ''[[Celebrity Duets]]'', paired with [[Chris Jericho]] of [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] fame. They were the first pair voted out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox.com/celebrityduets/recaps/index.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004233340/http://www.fox.com/celebrityduets/recaps/index.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 October 2006|title=FOX Broadcasting Company: Celebrity Duets: Recaps|author=|date=4 October 2006|access-date=24 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 September 2006, Frampton released an instrumental work titled ''Fingerprints''. His band consisted of drummer Shawn Fichter, guitarist [[Audley Freed]], bassist [[John Regan (bassist)|John Regan]] (Frampton's lifelong best friend,&lt;ref name=CNN-Phillips /&gt;), and keyboardist-guitarist Rob Arthur, and guest artists such as members of [[Pearl Jam]], [[Hank Marvin]], and his bassist on ''[[Frampton Comes Alive!]]'', [[Stanley Sheldon]] – the only member of the backing band on that album still alive.

====Recent events====
On 11 February 2007, ''Fingerprints'' was awarded the 2007 [[Grammy Award]] for Best Pop Instrumental Album. In February 2007, he also appeared on the Chicago-based PBS television show ''[[Soundstage (TV series)|Soundstage]]''.

Frampton released his 14th studio album, ''[[Thank You Mr. Churchill]]'', on 27 April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulletin.aarp.org/states/sd/2009/32/articles/singer_guitarist_peter_frampton_still_busy_ever.html |title=Daily News – Articles &amp; Info on Health, Money, Social Security, Medicare, Politics – Bulletin Today |website=Bulletin.aarp.org |date=7 March 1965 |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 2010 he began touring North America with the English band [[Yes (band)|Yes]]; the two acts had played stadium shows on a bill together in 1976.

He embarked on a UK Tour in March 2011 in support of his new album, visiting Leamington Spa, Glasgow, Manchester, London and Bristol.

Frampton went on tour in 2011 with The Frampton Comes Alive 35th Anniversary Tour that showcased and followed exactly the songs on the play list for the original tour from 1976, recorded for the famous ''Frampton Comes Alive!'' The concerts each night started with the prerecorded thump of a microphone being turned on, familiar to many fans of the album, followed by the recorded voice of Jerry Pompili saying, "If there was ever a musician that was an honorary member of San Francisco society, Mr. Peter Frampton"...and then the crowd goes wild. He played the album song for song for 69 locations between 15 June 2011, and 22 October 2011, throughout the US.

On 11 June 2011, Frampton performed a live set for "[[Guitar Center]] Sessions" on [[DirecTV]].

As an inside joke, he also appears briefly in the film as "Reg", a [[road manager]] for Humble Pie, Frampton's real-life former band.&lt;ref name=TCE-2001-02-04 /&gt;

In 2001, Frampton appeared as himself in ''[[Drew Carey's Back-to-School Rock 'n' Roll Comedy Hour]]'', in which he performs "You Had To Be There" and appears in a brief scene with Mimi, in which he recalls their past relationship.

On 20 December 2006, Frampton appeared on ''[[The Colbert Report]]''. [[Stephen Colbert]] had a fake feud with [[the Decemberists]] to be decided by a [[Guitar battle|head cutting]] duel. When Colbert faked an injury, Colbert called on Father Christmas to supply a guitar hero, at which point Frampton appeared and won the shred-down.

==Personal life==
===Marriages, other relationships and family===
Frampton has been married three times and has three children.

His first marriage was to Mary Lovett, from 1972 to 1976.

He was sued by Penelope J. "Penny" McCall in 1978 for [[palimony]]. McCall asked for half of Frampton's earnings during the five years that they were together. According to McCall, she gave up her job as a rock promoter and devoted herself full-time to Frampton, just as he achieved superstar status. A New York judge ruled that Frampton and McCall never intended to marry each other and "never held themselves out to the public as husband and wife" and dismissed her complaint on the grounds that to act otherwise would condone [[adultery]]. The case set precedent in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Peter Frampton Leaves Mark on Divorce and Family Law | url=http://www.johnkgrubb.com/peter-frampton-leaves-mark-on-divorce-and-family-law.html | work=John K.

===Other===
In June 1978, Frampton was involved in a near-fatal car accident in [[the Bahamas]] and suffered broken bones, a [[concussion]], and muscle damage. Dealing with the pain of the accident led to a brief period of [[drug abuse]].&lt;ref name=60s70s /&gt;&lt;ref name=AllMusic-Bio /&gt;

Frampton has lived in London and various U.S. locations, including [[Westchester County, New York]]; Los Angeles, California; and [[Nashville, Tennessee]].
