"'''Cry Me a River'''" is a song by American singer-songwriter [[Justin Timberlake]] for his debut solo album, ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]'' (2002). It was written by Timberlake and [[Scott Storch]] with producer [[Timbaland]] and was inspired by Timberlake's former relationship with singer [[Britney Spears]]. [[Jive Records]] released the song to [[Contemporary hit radio|contemporary hit]] and [[Rhythmic contemporary|rhythmic radio]] in the United States on November 26, 2002, as the album's second single. Accompanied by an [[electric piano]], [[Beatboxing|beatbox]], guitars, [[synthesizer]]s, [[Arabic music|Arabian]]-inspired [[riffs]] and [[Gregorian chant]]s, "Cry Me a River" is an [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] song about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his last girlfriend, who had cheated on him.

"Cry Me a River" received acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who considered it a stand-out track on ''Justified'' and praised Timbaland's production. The song earned several lists of best of the year and the decade (2000s), while ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' included it on their [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] at 484. It won a [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] at the [[2004 Grammy Awards|2004 ceremony]]. The song peaked at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[Pop Songs]] charts and charted in the top ten in other countries. It was certified double platinum by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) and platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI).

Filmmaker [[Francis Lawrence]] directed the music video for "Cry Me a River" in [[Malibu, California]]. In the controversial video, Timberlake's character invades the home of his ex-lover and films himself having sexual relations with another woman. Spears alleged that the video was a [[publicity stunt]], but Timberlake maintained that she did not inspire the production. The clip won the awards for [[Best Male Video]] and [[Best Pop Video]] at the [[2003 MTV Video Music Awards]]. Timberlake performed "Cry Me a River" on his four major concert tours: [[The Justified World Tour]] (2003–04), [[Justified and Stripped Tour]] (2003), [[FutureSex/LoveShow]] (2007), and [[The 20/20 Experience World Tour]] (2013–15). The song has been covered by various recording artists, including [[Kelly Clarkson]] and [[Taylor Swift]].

==Writing and production==
[[File:Britney Spears.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A blond woman wearing a black and white top and black pants is performing|Timberlake acknowledged in December 2011 that the inspiration for "Cry Me a River" was his ended relationship with [[Britney Spears]].]]

Timberlake and [[Scott Storch]] wrote "Cry Me a River" with [[Timbaland]], who produced the song.&lt;ref name="Notes"/&gt; Storch found working with Timberlake easy because of the song's meaning.&lt;ref name="mtv4"/&gt; Reporters believed its lyrics were inspired by Timberlake's romantic relationship with American recording artist [[Britney Spears]],&lt;ref name="mtv1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458390/timberlake-readies-new-single.jhtml?headlines=true|title=Justin Tightlipped About Whether 'River' Flows From Britney|last=Moss|first=Corey|date=October 29, 2002|accessdate=September 5, 2011|work=MTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ended in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1974703_1974707_1974580,00.html|title=Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, 2002|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|last=Webley|first=Kayla|date=March 23, 2010|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timberlake told [[MTV News]], "I'm not going to specifically say if any song is about anybody. I will say writing a couple of songs on the record helped me deal with a couple of things. To me songs are songs. They can stem from things that completely happened to you personally or they can stem from ideas that you think could happen to you."&lt;ref name="mtv1"/&gt; In December 2011, Timberlake admitted that he had written "Cry Me a River" after an argument with Spears: "I was on a phone call that was not the most enjoyable phone call. I walked into the studio and he [Timbaland] could tell I was visibly angry."&lt;ref name="huffington"/&gt; Timbaland recalled, "I was like, 'Man, don't worry about it' and he was like, 'I can't believe she did that to me' and he was like, 'You were my sun, you were my earth.'"&lt;ref name="huffington"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/12/22/justin-timberlake-britney-spears-cry-me-a-river_n_1164520.html|title=Justin Timberlake Reveals Britney Spears Inspiration Behind 'Cry Me A River'|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=December 22, 2011|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
===Development and synopsis===
The music video for "Cry Me a River" was directed by [[Francis Lawrence]], and filmed in [[Malibu, California]], during the week of October 29, 2002.&lt;ref name=mtv1/&gt; Lawrence created the video's concept and told MTV News, "[Justin and I] had a conversation on the phone and all he said was he wanted to have some dancing in it, but to do my thing. He told me what the song was about, but in a [general way] as well. He just said it was a kiss-off song and so I came up with this idea and he went for it".&lt;ref name=mtv3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1476973/river-about-britney-justin-but-not.jhtml|title='Cry Me A River' About Britney And Justin, But Not: VMA Lens Recap|last=Moss|first=Corey|date=August 18, 2003|accessdate=September 5, 2011|work=MTV News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031144756/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1476973/river-about-britney-justin-but-not.jhtml|archivedate=October 31, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence added that he also included some details in the video, including a reference to Spears's tattoo, which Timberlake enjoyed. He explained that he and Timberlake did not mention names while creating the video, only discussing the song's general beats.&lt;ref name=mtv3/&gt; Lawrence also revealed that executives of Jive Records were nervous about some aspects of the video, such as Timberlake's representation of a [[voyeur]] and the tone of some scenes he was portraying with a girl. "That's the thing I liked most about this project, was that he was coming into it with a super clean-cut image with [['N Sync]] and he's such a nice guy and so handsome and what I was into doing was making him be a bit scary. Lurking around the house in the rain, throwing a rock through her window, being a peeping Tom, getting revenge and doing stuff that's not really what a nice guy does."&lt;ref name=mtv3/&gt; The music video for "Cry Me a River" was released onto the [[iTunes Store]] on April 28, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/music-video/cry-me-a-river-edited-version/id207699128|title=Cry Me a River (Edited version)|work=iTunes Store (US)|accessdate=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She enters the house and goes with Timberlake to a bedroom, where she starts to undress and kiss him while being filmed. They stay in the bedroom for a moment; then the accomplice exits the house but Timberlake stays. As the blonde woman returns, he follows her around the house and hides in a closet as she showers. He gets closer to her and touches the glass surrounding the shower. The blonde woman senses someone in the room and turns around, but Timberlake is gone. She leaves the bathroom and goes into her bedroom, where the video he made with his new lover plays on the television.

Following the release of the music video, ''[[Us Weekly]]'' ran a cover story titled ''Britney Vs. Justin: The War Is On''. Timberlake denied that Spears inspired the video, saying, "The video is not about her. The video is about me."&lt;ref name="war"/&gt; However, Spears told ''Rolling Stone'' in October 2003 that she received a call from Timberlake saying there would be a look-alike of her in his music video. She states that he reassured her by saying, "Don't worry about it. It's not a big deal".&lt;ref name="britney rolling stone"/&gt; Spears, who had not seen the video, says she allowed him to do so but became infuriated after watching it. She recalled that when she asked why he had made a video about her, he replied, "Well, I got a controversial video."&lt;ref name="britney rolling stone"/&gt; She stated that it was a great [[publicity stunt]], commenting, "So he got what he wanted.

In 2013, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' editor Jason Lipshutz opined the clip was "one of the more brilliant musical moments in pop music since the dawn of the century.

He added, "The "Cry Me a River" video served a dual purpose for Timberlake: to court controversy, and to make its star seem more grown-up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5719195/why-wrecking-ball-is-miley-cyrus-cry-me-a-river-opinion | title=Why 'Wrecking Ball' Is Miley Cyrus' 'Cry Me A River' (Opinion) | work=Billboard | date=September 19, 2013 | accessdate=April 22, 2016 | author=Lipshutz, Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, ''Billboard'' critics named it the 24th "greatest music video of the 21st century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/list/8466543/100-greatest-music-videos-of-the-21st-century |title=The 100 Greatest Music Videos of the 21st Century: Critics' Picks |date=July 24, 2018 |work=Billboard |accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
