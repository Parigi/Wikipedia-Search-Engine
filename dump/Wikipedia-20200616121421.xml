'''''Phoenix''''' was a [[robotic spacecraft]] on a [[space exploration]] mission on [[Mars]] under the [[Mars Scout Program]]. The ''Phoenix'' [[lander (spacecraft)|lander]] landed on Mars on May 25, 2008.&lt;ref name="NASA-Phoenix" /&gt; Mission scientists used instruments aboard the lander to assess the local [[Planetary habitability|habitability]] and to research the history of [[water on Mars|water there]]. The total mission cost was about US$386 million, which includes cost of the launch.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title = NASA's Phoenix Mars Mission Gets Thumbs Up for 2007 Launch|url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/news/phoenix-060205.html|website = NASA official website|first1 = Guy|last1 = Webster|first2 = Dolores|last2 = Beasley|first3 = Lori|last3 = Stiles|date = June 2, 2005|accessdate = September 29, 2014|publisher = National Aeronautics and Space Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vic Stathopoulos"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mars Phoenix Lander |author=Vic Stathopoulos |website=AeroSpaceGuide.net |url=http://www.aerospaceguide.net/mars/phoenixlander.html |date=April 1, 2014 |accessdate=September 29, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809122553/http://www.aerospaceguide.net/mars/phoenixlander.html |archivedate=August 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cowing"&gt;{{cite web|title = NASA Has a Problem Calculating – and Admitting – What Space Missions Really Cost|first = Keith|last = Cowing|website = SpaceRef – Space news and reference|url = http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewnews.html?id=1027|date = June 3, 2005|accessdate = September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multi-agency program was headed by the [[Lunar and Planetary Laboratory]] at the [[University of Arizona]], under the direction of [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]. The program was a partnership of universities in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Denmark, Germany, the United Kingdom, NASA, the [[Canadian Space Agency]], the [[Finnish Meteorological Institute]], [[Lockheed Martin Space Systems]], [[MacDonald Dettwiler|MacDonald Dettwiler &amp; Associates]] (MDA) and other aerospace companies.&lt;ref name="jpl82"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-82 |title=NASA's ''Phoenix'' Spacecraft Reports Good Health After Mars Landing |accessdate=May 26, 2008 |date=May 25, 2008 |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528061944/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-82 |archivedate=May 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first mission to Mars led by a public university in NASA history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/opinions/2008/12/04/mars-space-arizona-oped-cx_ps_1205smith.html Forbes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217022119/http://www.forbes.com/opinions/2008/12/04/mars-space-arizona-oped-cx_ps_1205smith.html |date=December 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was led directly from the University of Arizona's campus in Tucson, with project management at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and project development at Lockheed Martin in Denver, Colorado. The operational funding for the mission extended through November 10, 2008.

''Phoenix'' was NASA's sixth successful landing out of seven attempts and was the first successful landing in a Martian polar region. The lander completed its mission in August 2008, and made a last brief communication with Earth on November 2 as available [[solar power]] dropped with the Martian winter. The mission was declared concluded on November 10, 2008, after engineers were unable to re-contact the craft.&lt;ref name="BBC_NASA_Mission_Declared_Dead"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7721032.stm|title=NASA Mars Mission declared dead|accessdate=November 10, 2008|publisher=BBC|date=November 10, 2008|first=Jonathan|last=Amos}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After unsuccessful attempts to contact the lander by the [[Mars Odyssey]] orbiter up to and past the Martian summer solstice on May 12, 2010, JPL declared the lander to be dead. The program was considered a success because it completed all planned science experiments and observations.&lt;ref name=discovery&gt;{{cite news|title=Dear Phoenix lander, will you raise from the dead? |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/dear-phoenix-mars-lander-will-you-rise-from-the-dead.html |newspaper=Discovery |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520023719/http://news.discovery.com/space/dear-phoenix-mars-lander-will-you-rise-from-the-dead.html |archivedate=May 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission overview==
[[File:070802 phoenix lab 02.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A labeled look at NASA's ''Phoenix'' Mars lander.]]

The mission had two goals. One was to study the [[geological]] history of water, the key to unlocking the story of past [[Climate change (general concept)|climate change]]. The second was to evaluate past or potential [[planetary habitability]] in the ice-soil boundary. ''Phoenix'''s instruments were suitable for uncovering information on the geological and possibly biological history of the Martian Arctic. ''Phoenix'' was the first mission to return data from either of the poles, and contributed to NASA's main strategy for Mars exploration, "''Follow the water.''"

The primary mission was anticipated to last 90 [[Timekeeping on Mars|sols]] (Martian days)—just over 92 Earth days. However, the craft exceeded its expected operational lifetime&lt;ref name="Sky &amp;amp; Telescope"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/community/skyblog/newsblog/27910644.html|title=Phoenix Surpasses 90-Day Mileston|publisher=SkyandTelescope.com|date=September 5, 2008|accessdate=August 1, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808031416/http://www.skyandtelescope.com/community/skyblog/newsblog/27910644.html|archive-date=August 8, 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a little over two months before succumbing to the increasing cold and dark of an advancing Martian winter.&lt;ref name="BBC_NASA_Mission_Declared_Dead" /&gt; Researchers had hoped that the lander would survive into the Martian winter so that it could witness polar ice developing around it – perhaps up to 1 metre of solid carbon dioxide ice could have appeared. Even had it survived some of the winter, the intense cold would have prevented it from lasting all the way through.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/070201_phoenix_update.html ''Phoenix'' Lander Readied For Mars Exploration], space.com, Leonard David, February 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The mission was chosen to be a fixed lander rather than a rover because:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The ''Phoenix'' Mars Mission with Dr. Deborah Bass|series=Futures in Biotech podcast|airdate=September 19, 2007|number=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* costs were reduced through reuse of earlier equipment (the total mission cost was estimated to be about US$386 million, which includes the launch&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vic Stathopoulos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cowing"/&gt;);
* the area of Mars where ''Phoenix'' landed is thought to be relatively uniform, thus traveling is of less value; and
* the [[weight budget]] needed for mobility could instead be used for more and better scientific instruments.

The 2003–2004 observations of [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|methane gas on Mars]] were made remotely by three teams working with separate data. If the methane is truly present in the [[atmosphere of Mars]], then something must be producing it on the planet now, because the gas is broken down by radiation on Mars within 300 years;&lt;ref name="methane3"&gt;Mumma, M.

===History===
[[File:Phoenix Mars Lander in testing PIA01885.jpg|thumb|right|''Phoenix'' during testing in September 2006]]

While the proposal for ''Phoenix'' was being written, the [[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars Odyssey Orbiter]] used its [[gamma-ray spectrometer]] and found the distinctive signature of [[hydrogen]] on some areas of the [[Martian surface]], and the only plausible source of hydrogen on Mars would be [[Water on Mars|water]] in the form of ice, frozen below the surface. The mission was therefore funded on the expectation that ''Phoenix'' would find water ice on the arctic plains of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7408033.stm |title=''Phoenix'' diary: Mission to Mars |publisher=BBC News |date=August 19, 2008 |accessdate=July 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2003 NASA selected the [[University of Arizona]] "''Phoenix''" mission for launch in 2007. It was hoped this would be the first in a new line of smaller, low-cost, [[Mars Scout Program|Scout]] missions in the agency's [[exploration of Mars]] program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2003-107 "Mars 2007 ''Phoenix'' studied water near Mars' North Pole"] August 4, 2003 NASA Press release. URL accessed April 2, 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060102212528/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2003-107 |date=January 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The selection was the result of an intense two-year competition with proposals from other institutions. The $325 million NASA award is more than six times larger than any other single research grant in University of Arizona history.

[[Peter Smith (scientist)|Peter H. Smith]] of the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, as Principal Investigator, along with 24 Co-Investigators, were selected to lead the mission. The mission was named after the [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]], a mythological bird that is repeatedly reborn from its own ashes. The ''Phoenix'' spacecraft contains several previously built components. The lander used for the 2007–08 mission is the modified [[Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander]] (canceled in 2000), along with several of the instruments from both that and the previous unsuccessful [[Mars Polar Lander]] mission. [[Lockheed Martin]], who built the lander, had kept the nearly complete lander in an environmentally controlled [[clean room]] from 2001 until the mission was funded by the NASA [[Mars Scout Program|Scout Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Phoenix'' Mars Lander- Spacecraft|website=Phoenix Mars Lander|url=http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/science_spacecraft.php|accessdate=June 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Phoenix'' was a partnership of universities, NASA centers, and the aerospace industry. The science instruments and operations were a [[University of Arizona]] responsibility. [[NASA]]'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in [[Pasadena, California]], managed the project and provided mission design and control. [[Lockheed Martin Space Systems]] built and tested the spacecraft. The [[Canadian Space Agency]] provided a [[meteorological station]], including an innovative [[laser]]-based atmospheric sensor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://passatltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CSA-Certificate-Recognition1.jpg "Certificate of Recognition"] Passat Ltd.[https://passatltd.com website].

Scientists from [[Imperial College London]] and the [[University of Bristol]] provided hardware for the mission and were part of the team operating the microscope station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Phoenix'' probe due to touch down on Martian surface |website=STFC |url=http://www.scitech.ac.uk/PMC/PRel/STFC/phoenix1.aspx |accessdate=May 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521031734/http://www.scitech.ac.uk/PMC/PRel/STFC/phoenix1.aspx |archivedate=May 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2005, following a critical review of the project's planning progress and preliminary design, NASA approved the mission to proceed as planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2005/jun/HQ_05141_Phoenix_Mars_Mission.html|title=NASA's ''Phoenix'' Mars Mission Begins Launch Preparations|publisher=NASA|date=June 2, 2005|accessdate=April 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the review was to confirm NASA's confidence in the mission.

==Scientific payload==
[[File:Phoenix Mars Lander.jpg|thumb|right|Phoenix Mars Lander being worked on by NASA engineers. The planned operational life of the ''Phoenix'' lander was 90 [[Timekeeping on Mars|Martian days]]. Each Martian day is 40 minutes longer than an Earth Day.]]

''Phoenix'' carried improved versions of University of Arizona panoramic cameras and volatiles-analysis instrument from the ill-fated [[Mars Polar Lander]], as well as experiments that had been built for the canceled [[Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander]], including a JPL trench-digging robotic arm, a set of wet chemistry laboratories, and optical and [[atomic force microscope]]s. The science payload also included a descent imager and a suite of meteorological instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2005.03.038 |pmid=16010756 |title=Phoenix—the first Mars Scout mission |journal=Acta Astronautica |volume=57 |issue=2–8 |pages=121–34 |year=2005 |last1=Shotwell |first1=Robert |bibcode=2005AcAau..57..121S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During EDL, the Atmospheric Structure Experiment was conducted. This used accelerometer and gyroscope data recorded during the lander's descent through the atmosphere to create a vertical profile of the temperature, pressure, and density of the atmosphere above the landing site, at that point in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Withers|first=Paul|last2=Catling|first2=D.C.|date=December 23, 2010|title=Observations of atmospheric tides on Mars at the season and latitude of the Phoenix atmospheric entry|url=https://faculty.washington.edu/dcatling/Withers2010_CatlingGRL.pdf|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=37|issue=24|pages=n/a|doi=10.1029/2010GL045382|via=|bibcode=2010GeoRL..3724204W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robotic arm and camera===
[[File:Arm Stowed.jpg|thumb|left|The robotic digging arm. ''Left'': at landing, with covering in place. ''Right'': the next day, with covering pushed aside.]]

The robotic arm was designed to extend 2.35 m from its base on the lander, and had the ability to dig down to 0.5 m below sandy surface. It took samples of dirt and ice that were analyzed by other instruments on the lander. The arm was designed and built for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory by ''Alliance Spacesystems, LLC''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliancespacesystems.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=121&amp;Itemid=130|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515101513/http://www.alliancespacesystems.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=121&amp;Itemid=130|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 15, 2011|publisher=Alliance Spacesystems|title=Mars '01 Robotic Arm|accessdate=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now MDA US Systems, LLC) in Pasadena, California. A rotating rasp-tool located in the heel of the scoop was used to cut into the strong permafrost. Cuttings from the rasp were ejected into the heel of the scoop and transferred to the front for delivery to the instruments. The rasp tool was conceived of at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The flight version of the rasp was designed and built by HoneyBee Robotics. Commands were sent for the arm to be deployed on May 28, 2008, beginning with the pushing aside of a protective covering intended to serve as a redundant precaution against potential contamination of Martian soil by Earthly life-forms.
The Robotic Arm Camera (RAC) attached to the robotic arm just above the scoop was able to take full-color pictures of the area, as well as verify the samples that the scoop returned, and examined the grains of the area where the robotic arm had just dug. The camera was made by the [[University of Arizona]] and [[Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mps.mpg.de/en/projekte/phoenix/rac/ |title=RAC Robotic Arm Camera |publisher=Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410015404/http://www.mps.mpg.de/en/projekte/phoenix/rac/ |archivedate=April 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/1999JE001123 |title=The MVACS Robotic Arm Camera |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets |volume=106 |issue=E8 |pages=17609–22 |year=2001 |last1=Keller |first1=H.

[[File:181451main surface stereo imager-hires.jpg|thumb|right|Surface Stereo Imager (SSI) built by the University of Arizona.]]

===Surface stereo imager===
The Surface Stereo Imager (SSI) was the primary camera on the lander. It is a [[stereo camera]] that is described as "a higher resolution upgrade of the imager used for [[Mars Pathfinder]] and the [[Mars Polar Lander]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Phoenix'' Mars Lander- SSI |website=Phoenix Mars Lander |url=http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/technology/ssi.php |accessdate=May 25, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011012548/http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/technology/ssi.php |archivedate=October 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It took several stereo images of the Martian Arctic, and also used the Sun as a reference to measure the atmospheric distortion of the [[Martian atmosphere]] due to dust, air and other features.

===Thermal and evolved gas analyzer===
[[File:183833main wb1-tega-hires.jpg|thumb|left|Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer (TEGA).]]
{{Main|Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer}}

The Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer (TEGA) is a combination of a high-temperature furnace with a [[mass spectrometer]]. It was used to bake samples of Martian dust and determine the composition of the resulting vapors. It has eight ovens, each about the size of a large ball-point pen, which were able to analyze one sample each, for a total of eight separate samples. Team members measured how much water vapor and [[carbon dioxide]] gas were given off, how much water ice the samples contained, and what minerals are present that may have formed during a wetter, warmer past climate. The instrument also measured [[Volatile organic compound|organic volatiles]], such as [[methane]], down to 10 [[Parts per billion|ppb]]. TEGA was built by the [[University of Arizona]] and [[University of Texas at Dallas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/1999JE001153 |title=Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer: Part of the Mars Volatile and Climate Surveyor integrated payload |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets |volume=106 |issue=E8 |pages=17683–98 |year=2001 |last1=Boynton |first1=William V |last2=Bailey |first2=Samuel H |last3=Hamara |first3=David K |last4=Williams |first4=Michael S |last5=Bode |first5=Rolfe C |last6=Fitzgibbon |first6=Michael R |last7=Ko |first7=Wenjeng |last8=Ward |first8=Michael G |last9=Sridhar |first9=K.

On May 29, 2008 (sol {{age in sols|2008|05|25|2008|05|29}}), electrical tests indicated an intermittent short circuit in TEGA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=May 30, 2008 |title=NASA'S ''Phoenix'' Lander Robotic Arm Camera Sees Possible Ice |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-090 |url-status=dead |publisher= Jet Propulsion Laboratory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531115209/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-090 |archivedate=May 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting from a glitch in one of the two filaments responsible for ionizing volatiles.&lt;ref name="nbc-snag"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=Andrea |title=Mars lander hunts ice and hits a snag |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/24896021 |accessdate=May 19, 2020 |work=msnbc.com |date=May 30, 2008 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA worked around the problem by configuring the backup filament as the primary and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;NASA press conference, June 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 11 the first of the eight ovens was filled with a soil sample after several tries to get the soil sample through the screen of TEGA. On June 17, it was announced that no water was found in this sample; however, since it had been exposed to the atmosphere for several days prior to entering the oven, any initial water ice it might have contained could have been lost via [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Mars Descent Imager===
[[File:181445main mardi-hires.jpg|thumb|right|Mars Descent Imager built by Malin Space Science Systems.]]

The Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) was intended to take pictures of the landing site during the last three minutes of descent. As originally planned, it would have begun taking pictures after the aeroshell departed, about 8&amp;nbsp;km above the Martian soil.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Before launch, testing of the assembled spacecraft uncovered a potential data corruption problem with an interface card that was designed to route MARDI image data as well as data from various other parts of the spacecraft. The potential problem could occur if the interface card were to receive a MARDI picture during a critical phase of the spacecraft's final descent, at which point data from the spacecraft's [[Inertial Measurement Unit]] could have been lost; this data was critical to controlling the descent and landing. This was judged to be an unacceptable risk, and it was decided to not use MARDI during the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/science_mardi.php|title=Mars Descent Imager (MARDI)|date=May 27, 2008|publisher=[[University of Arizona]]|access-date=February 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221082421/http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/science_mardi.php|archive-date=February 21, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the flaw was discovered too late for repairs, the camera remained installed on ''Phoenix'' but it was not used to take pictures, nor was its built-in microphone used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msss.com/msl/mardi/news/12Nov07/index.html|title=Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) Update|date=November 12, 2007|publisher=[[Malin Space Science Systems]]|access-date=December 3, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904020224/http://www.msss.com/msl/mardi/news/12Nov07/index.html|archive-date=September 4, 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MARDI images had been intended to help pinpoint exactly where the lander landed, and possibly help find potential science targets. It was also to be used to learn if the area where the lander lands is typical of the surrounding terrain. MARDI was built by [[Malin Space Science Systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/1999JE001144 |title=Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) on the Mars Polar Lander |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets |volume=106 |issue=E8 |pages=17635–50 |year=2001 |last1=Malin |first1=M.

It had originally been designed and built to perform the same function on the [[Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander]] mission; after that mission was canceled, MARDI spent several years in storage until it was deployed on the ''Phoenix'' lander.

===Microscopy, electrochemistry, and conductivity analyzer===
[[File:A prototype wet chemistry beaker.jpg|thumb|right|A prototype wet chemistry [[Beaker (glassware)|beaker]] showing some of the electrochemistry sensors on the sides of the beaker.]]

The Microscopy, Electrochemistry, and Conductivity Analyzer (MECA) is an instrument package originally designed for the canceled [[Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander]] mission. It consists of a [[wet chemistry]] lab (WCL), [[Optical microscope|optical]] and [[atomic force microscope|atomic force microscopes]], and a thermal and electrical [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] probe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spacecraft and Science Instruments|website=Phoenix Mars Lander|url=http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/science05.php|accessdate=March 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jet Propulsion Laboratory built MECA. A [[Switzerland|Swiss]] consortium led by the [[University of Neuchatel]] contributed the atomic force microscope.&lt;ref name="Atomic Force Microscope on Mars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mars-afm.ch/ |title=Atomic Force Microscope on Mars |accessdate=May 25, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531151057/http://www.mars-afm.ch/ |archivedate=May 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using MECA, researchers examined soil particles as small as 16 [[μm]] across; additionally, they attempted to determine the chemical composition of water-soluble ions in the soil. They also measured electrical and thermal conductivity of soil particles using a probe on the robotic arm scoop.&lt;ref name="DecagonTECP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.decagon.com/thermal/info/mars.php |title=Decagon designs part of the ''Phoenix'' Mars Lander |accessdate=May 25, 2008 |publisher=Decagon Devices, Inc. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528153334/http://www.decagon.com/thermal/info/mars.php |archivedate=May 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Optical microscope====
The [[optical microscope]], designed by the [[University of Arizona]], is capable of making images of the Martian [[regolith]] with a resolution of 256 pixels/mm or 16 micrometers/pixel. The field of view of the microscope is a 2×2&amp;nbsp;mm sample holder to which the robotic arm delivers the sample. The sample is illuminated either by 9 red, green and blue [[LED]]s or by 3 LEDs emitting [[UV|ultraviolet light]]. The electronics for the readout of the CCD chip are shared with the robotic arm camera which has an identical [[Charge-coupled device|CCD chip]].

====Atomic force microscope====
The [[atomic force microscope]] has access to a small area of the sample delivered to the optical microscope. The instrument scans over the sample with one of 8 [[silicon]] crystal tips and measures the repulsion of the tip from the sample. The maximum resolution is 0.1 [[micrometre]]s. A [[Switzerland|Swiss]] consortium led by the [[University of Neuchatel]] contributed the atomic force microscope.&lt;ref name="Atomic Force Microscope on Mars"/&gt;

====Wet Chemistry Laboratory (WCL)====
[[File:Phoenix wet chemistry lab.gif|thumb|200px|Illustration of how the wet chemistry lab onboard ''Phoenix'' mixes a Martian soil sample with water]]

The wet chemistry lab (WCL) sensor assembly and leaching solution were designed and built by [[Thermo Fisher Scientific]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11543343 |year=1999 |last1=West |first1=S.

[[Tufts University]] developed the reagent pellets, barium ISE, and ASV electrodes, and performed the preflight characterization of the sensor array.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tufts Journal: A decade of lab work hurtles toward Mars|url=http://tuftsjournal.tufts.edu/archive/2007/september/corner/index.shtml|accessdate=May 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The robotic arm scooped up some soil and put it in one of four wet chemistry lab cells, where water was added, and, while stirring, an array of electrochemical sensors measured a dozen dissolved ions such as [[sodium]], [[magnesium]], [[calcium]], and [[sulfate]] that leached out from the soil into the water. This provided information on the biological compatibility of the soil, both for possible indigenous microbes and for possible future Earth visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/2002JE001978 |pmid=14686320 |title=Mars Surveyor Program '01 Mars Environmental Compatibility Assessment wet chemistry lab: A sensor array for chemical analysis of the Martian soil |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=108 |issue=E7 |pages=13-1 - 13-12 |year=2003 |last1=Kounaves |first1=Samuel P |last2=Lukow |first2=Stefan R |last3=Comeau |first3=Brian P |last4=Hecht |first4=Michael H |last5=Grannan-Feldman |first5=Sabrina M |last6=Manatt |first6=Ken |last7=West |first7=Steven J |last8=Wen |first8=Xiaowen |last9=Frant |first9=Martin |last10=Gillette |first10=Tim |bibcode=2003JGRE..108.5077K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the four wet chemistry labs were identical, each containing 26 chemical sensors and a temperature sensor. The polymer Ion Selective Electrodes (ISE) were able to determine the concentration of ions by measuring the change in electric potential across their ion-selective membranes as a function of concentration.&lt;ref name="Kounaves et al 2010 Journal of Geophysical Research"/&gt; Two gas sensing electrodes for oxygen and carbon dioxide worked on the same principle but with gas-permeable membranes. A gold micro-electrode array was used for the [[cyclic voltammetry]] and [[anodic stripping voltammetry]]. Cyclic voltammetry is a method to study ions by applying a waveform of varying potential and measuring the current–voltage curve. Anodic stripping voltammetry first deposits the metal ions onto the gold electrode with an applied potential. After the potential is reversed, the current is measured while the metals are stripped off the electrode.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

====Thermal and Electrical Conductivity Probe (TECP)====
{{more citations needed section|date=August 2017}}&lt;!--no references after the list--&gt;
[[File:Phoenix thermal and electrical conductivity probe.jpg|thumb|200px|The Thermal and Electrical Conductivity Probe (TECP) with four metal sensing needles mounted in a plastic head.]]
The MECA contains a Thermal and Electrical Conductivity Probe (TECP).&lt;ref name="DecagonTECP" /&gt; The TECP, designed by [[Decagon Devices]],&lt;ref name="DecagonTECP" /&gt; has four probes that made the following measurements: [[Martian soil]] temperature, relative humidity, [[thermal conductivity]], [[electrical conductivity]], [[dielectric permittivity]], wind speed, and atmospheric temperature.

Three of the four probes have tiny heating elements and temperature sensors inside them. One probe uses internal heating elements to send out a pulse of heat, recording the time the pulse is sent and monitoring the rate at which the heat is dissipated away from the probe. Adjacent needles sense when the heat pulse arrives. The speed that the heat travels away from the probe as well as the speed that it travels between probes allows scientists to measure thermal conductivity, specific heat (the ability of the regolith to conduct heat relative to its ability to store heat) and thermal diffusivity (the speed at which a thermal disturbance is propagated in the soil).&lt;ref name="NASATECPTechReport"&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090033138.pdf#page=21| title=The Thermal Electrical Conductivity Probe (TECP) for Phoenix| last=Zent| first=Aaron|date=July 30, 2008| website=NASA Technical Reports Server| access-date=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The probes also measured the [[Permittivity|dielectric permittivity]] and [[electrical conductivity]], which can be used to calculate moisture and salinity of the [[regolith]]. Needles 1 and 2 work in conjunction to measure salts in the regolith, heat the soil to measure thermal properties (thermal conductivity, specific heat and thermal diffusivity) of the regolith, and measure soil temperature. Needles 3 and 4 measure liquid water in the regolith. Needle 4 is a reference thermometer for needles 1 and 2.&lt;ref name="NASATECPTechReport" /&gt;

The TECP humidity sensor is a relative humidity sensor, so it must be coupled with a temperature sensor in order to measure absolute humidity. Both the relative humidity sensor and a temperature sensor are attached directly to the circuit board of the TECP and are, therefore, assumed to be at the same temperature.&lt;ref name="NASATECPTechReport" /&gt;

===Meteorological station===
{{Wikinews|Canada contributes weather station to NASA Mars mission}}
The Meteorological Station (MET) recorded the daily [[Climate of Mars|weather of Mars]] during the course of the ''Phoenix'' mission.

This enhanced image shows wind from the northeast on Sol 3.]]

The surface wind velocity, pressure, and temperature were also monitored over the mission (from the tell-tale, pressure, and temperature sensors) and show the evolution of the atmosphere with time. To measure dust and ice contribution to the atmosphere, a lidar was employed. The lidar collected information about the time-dependent structure of the [[planetary boundary layer]] by investigating the vertical distribution of dust, ice, fog, and clouds in the local atmosphere.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[File:279902main Temperature SD.jpg|thumb|left|Plot of the minimum daily temperature measured by Phoenix]]

There are three temperature sensors ([[thermocouple]]s) on a 1 m vertical mast (shown at left in its stowed position) at heights of approximately 250, 500 and 1000&amp;nbsp;mm above the lander deck. The sensors were referenced to a measurement of absolute temperature at the base of the mast. A pressure sensor built by Finnish Meteorological Institute is located in the Payload Electronics Box, which sits on the surface of the deck, and houses the acquisition electronics for the MET payload. The Pressure and Temperature sensors commenced operations on Sol 0 (May 26, 2008) and operated continuously, sampling once every 2 seconds.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The Telltale is a joint Canadian/Danish instrument (right) which provides a coarse estimate of wind speed and direction. The speed is based on the amount of deflection from vertical that is observed, while the wind direction is provided by which way this deflection occurs. A mirror, located under the telltale, and a calibration "cross," above (as observed through the mirror) are employed to increase the accuracy of the measurement. Either camera, [[Phoenix (spacecraft)#Surface stereo imager|SSI]] or [[Phoenix (spacecraft)#Robotic arm and camera|RAC]], could make this measurement, though the former was typically used. Periodic observations both day and night aid in understanding the [[Day|diurnal]] variability of wind at the ''Phoenix'' landing site.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The wind speeds ranged from 11 to 58&amp;nbsp;km/h. The usual average speed was 36&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref name="asc-csa.gc.ca"/&gt;

[[File:Lidar open.jpg|thumb|left|First operation of lidar on Mars; telescope (black tube) and laser window (smaller opening in foreground) can be seen.]]

The vertical-pointing lidar was capable of detecting multiple types of [[backscattering]] (for example [[Rayleigh scattering]] and [[Mie Scattering]]), with the delay between laser pulse generation and the return of light scattered by atmospheric particles determining the altitude at which scattering occurs. Additional information was obtained from backscattered light at different wavelengths (colors), and the ''Phoenix'' system transmitted both 532&amp;nbsp;nm and 1064&amp;nbsp;nm. Such wavelength dependence may make it possible to discriminate between ice and dust, and serve as an indicator of the effective particle size.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[File:Sol 004 lidar.jpg|thumb|right|Contour plot of second lidar operation. The colors show evolution of dust passing overhead with time (red/orange: more dust, blue/green: less dust)]]

The ''Phoenix'' lidar's laser was a passive [[Q-switch]]ed [[Nd:YAG]] laser with the dual wavelengths of 1064&amp;nbsp;nm and 532&amp;nbsp;nm. It operated at 100&amp;nbsp;Hz with a pulse width of 10 ns. The scattered light was received by two detectors (green and IR) and the green signal was collected in both analog and photon counting modes.&lt;ref name=Car2004&gt;{{cite conference|title=LIDAR for Mars Atmospheric Studies on 2007 Scout Mission "''Phoenix''" |author=Carswell, Allan Ian |bibcode=2004ESASP.561..973C |volume=561 |date=2004 |page=973 |conference=22nd International Laser Radar Conference (ILRC 2004)|display-authors=etal|author-link=Allan Ian Carswell }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/polar2006/pdf/8082.pdf|title=''Phoenix'' LIDAR Characterization |author=Whiteway, J. |display-authors=4 |author2=Cook, C. |author3=Komguem, L. |author4=Ilnicki, M. |author5=Greene, M. |author6=Dickinson, C. |author7=Heymsfield, A.|date=2006|accessdate=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phoenix Lidar Laser Movie.gif|180px|thumb|left|Lidar operating (thin vertical beam at center right).]]

The lidar was operated for the first time at noon on Sol 3 (May 29, 2008), recording the first surface extraterrestrial atmospheric profile. This first profile indicated well-mixed dust in the first few kilometers of the [[atmosphere of Mars]], where the planetary boundary layer was observed by a marked decrease in scattering signal. The contour plot (right) shows the amount of dust as a function of time and altitude, with warmer colors (red, orange) indicating more dust, and cooler colors (blue, green), indicating less dust. There is also an instrumentation effect of the laser warming up, causing the appearance of dust increasing with time. A layer at 3.5&amp;nbsp;km can be observed in the plot, which could be extra dust, or—less likely, given the time of sol this was acquired—a low altitude ice cloud.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

''Phoenix'' was launched on August 4, 2007, at 5:26:34&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (09:26:34 [[UTC]]) on a [[Delta II]] 7925 launch vehicle from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Pad 17-A]] of the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]]. The launch was nominal with no significant anomalies. The ''Phoenix'' lander was placed on a [[trajectory]] of such precision that its first trajectory course correction burn, performed on August 10, 2007 at 7:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. EDT (11:30 UTC), was only 18&amp;nbsp;m/s. The launch took place during a [[launch window]] extending from August 3, 2007 to August 24, 2007. Due to the small launch window, the rescheduled launch of the [[Dawn (spacecraft)|''Dawn'' mission]] (originally planned for July 7) had to be launched after ''Phoenix'' in September. The Delta II rocket was chosen due to its successful launch history, which includes launches of the ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s in 2003 and [[Mars Pathfinder]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/phases02.php|title=''Phoenix'' Mars Mission – Launch|publisher=University of Arizona|accessdate=August 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[noctilucent cloud]] was created by the [[exhaust gas]] from the Delta II 7925 rocket used to launch ''Phoenix''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/images.php?gID=187&amp;cID=5|title=Phoenix Noctilucent Cloud|publisher=University of Arizona|accessdate=August 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colors in the cloud formed from the prism-like effect of the ice particles present in the exhaust trail.

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory made adjustments to the orbits of its two active satellites around Mars, [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] and Mars Odyssey, and the [[European Space Agency]] similarly adjusted the orbit of its [[Mars Express]] spacecraft to be in the right place on May 25, 2008 to observe ''Phoenix'' as it entered the atmosphere and then landed on the surface.

The landing was made on a flat surface, with the lander reporting only 0.3 degrees of tilt. Just before landing, the craft used its thrusters to orient its solar panels along an east-west axis to maximize power generation. The lander waited 15 minutes before opening its solar panels, to allow dust to settle. The first images from the lander became available around 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. PDT (2008-05-26 02:00 UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fawkes1.lpl.arizona.edu/gallery.php |title=''Phoenix'' Mars Mission – Gallery |date=May 26, 2008 |publisher=Arizona University |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816020709/http://fawkes1.lpl.arizona.edu/gallery.php |archivedate=August 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The images show a surface strewn with pebbles and incised with small troughs into polygons about 5 m across and 10&amp;nbsp;cm high, with the expected absence of large rocks and hills.

====Communications from the surface====
[[File:Phoenix mission horizon stitched high definition.jpg|thumb|right|Approximate-color photomosaic of thermal contraction crack polygons in Martian [[permafrost]].]]

The [[robotic arm]]'s first movement was delayed by one day when, on May 27, 2008, commands from Earth were not relayed to the ''Phoenix'' lander on Mars. The commands went to NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter as planned, but the orbiter's [[Electra (radio)|Electra]] UHF radio system for relaying commands to ''Phoenix'' temporarily shut off. Without new commands, the lander instead carried out a set of backup activities. On May 27 the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter relayed images and other information from those activities back to Earth.

The robotic arm was a critical part of the ''Phoenix'' Mars mission. On May 28, scientists leading the mission sent commands to unstow its robotic arm and take more images of its landing site. The images revealed that the spacecraft landed where it had access to digging down a polygon across the trough and digging into its center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/05_28_pr.php ''Phoenix'' Mars Mission], NASA's ''Phoenix'' Spacecraft Commanded to Unstow Arm, [[University of Arizona]], May 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The lander's robotic arm touched soil on Mars for the first time on May 31, 2008 (sol {{age in sols|2008|05|25|2008|05|31}}). It scooped dirt and started sampling the Martian soil for ice after days of testing its systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Wray |author2=Ulf Stabe |last-author-amp=yes |url=http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/200822/1121/Surface-ice-found-as-Phoenix-prepares-to-dig |title=thetechherald.com, Surface ice found as ''Phoenix'' prepares to dig |publisher=Thetechherald.com |accessdate=July 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003142810/http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/200822/1121/Surface-ice-found-as-Phoenix-prepares-to-dig |archivedate=October 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 31, 2008 (sol {{age in sols|2008|05|25|2008|07|31}}), NASA announced that ''Phoenix'' confirmed the presence of water ice on Mars, as predicted in 2002 by the [[Mars Odyssey]] orbiter. During the initial heating cycle of a new sample, TEGA's mass spectrometer detected water vapor when the sample temperature reached 0&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=John|title=There's water on Mars, NASA confirms|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 1, 2008|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-phoenix1-2008aug01,0,3012423.story|accessdate=August 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Liquid water cannot exist on the surface of Mars with its present low atmospheric pressure, except at the lowest elevations for short periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/2004JE002261 |title=Formation of Martian gullies by the action of liquid water flowing under current Martian environmental conditions |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=110 |issue=E5 |pages=E05004 |year=2005 |last1=Heldmann |first1=Jennifer L |last2=Toon |first2=Owen B |last3=Pollard |first3=Wayne H |last4=Mellon |first4=Michael T |last5=Pitlick |first5=John |last6=McKay |first6=Christopher P |last7=Andersen |first7=Dale T |bibcode=2005JGRE..110.5004H |hdl=2060/20050169988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/2006GL025946 |title=Recent high-latitude icy mantle in the northern plains of Mars: Characteristics and ages of emplacement |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=L11201 |year=2006 |last1=Kostama |first1=V.-P |last2=Kreslavsky |first2=M. A |last3=Head |first3=J. W |bibcode=2006GeoRL..3311201K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''Phoenix'' in good working order, NASA announced operational funding through September 30, 2008 (sol {{age in sols|2008|05|25|2008|09|30}}). The science team worked to determine whether the water ice ever thaws enough to be available for life processes and if carbon-containing chemicals and other raw materials for life are present.

Additionally during 2008 and early 2009 a debate emerged within NASA over the presence of 'blobs' which appeared on photos of the vehicle's landing struts, which have been variously described as being either water droplets or 'clumps of frost'.&lt;ref name="NYTimes20090316"/&gt; Due to the lack of consensus within the ''Phoenix'' science project, the issue had not been raised in any NASA news conferences.&lt;ref name="NYTimes20090316"&gt;Chang, Kenneth (2009) [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/science/17mars.html?ref=space Blobs in Photos of Mars Lander Stir a Debate: Are They Water?], New York Times (online), March 16, 2009, retrieved April 4, 2009;&lt;/ref&gt;

One scientist thought that the lander's thrusters splashed a pocket of [[brine]] from just below the Martian surface onto the landing strut during the vehicle's landing. The salts would then have absorbed water vapor from the air, which would have explained how they appeared to grow in size during the first 44 sols (Martian days) before slowly evaporating as Mars temperature dropped.&lt;ref name="NYTimes20090316"/&gt;

====Wet chemistry====
On June 24, 2008 (sol {{age in sols|2008|05|25|2008|06|24}}), NASA's scientists launched a series of scientific tests. The robotic arm scooped up more soil and delivered it to 3 different on-board analyzers: an oven that baked it and tested the emitted gases, a microscopic imager, and a [[wet chemistry]] laboratory (WCL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;1266131885 |title=computerworld.com.au, NASA: With Martian ice discovered, major tests beginning |publisher=Computerworld.com.au |date=June 24, 2008 |accessdate=July 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230220352/http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id%3B1266131885 |archivedate=December 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lander's robotic arm scoop was positioned over the Wet Chemistry Lab delivery funnel on Sol 29 (the 29th Martian day after landing, i.e. June 24, 2008). The soil was transferred to the instrument on sol {{age in sols|2008|05|25|2008|06|25}} (June 25, 2008), and ''Phoenix'' performed the first wet chemistry tests. On Sol 31 (June 26, 2008) ''Phoenix'' returned the wet chemistry test results with information on the salts in the soil, and its acidity. The wet chemistry lab (WCL)&lt;ref name='Kounaves 2009'/&gt; was part of the suite of tools called the Microscopy, Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer (MECA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uanews.org/node/20315 |title=uanews.org, ''Phoenix'' Lander Arm Poised to Deliver Sample for Wet Chemistry |publisher=Uanews.org |date=June 24, 2008 |accessdate=July 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solar-powered lander operated two months longer than its three-month prime mission. The lander was designed to last 90 days, and had been running on bonus time since the successful end of its primary mission in August 2008.&lt;ref name="Sky &amp;amp; Telescope"/&gt; On October 28, 2008 (sol {{age in sols|2008|05|25|2008|10|28}}), the spacecraft went into [[Safe mode (spacecraft)|safe mode]] due to power constraints based on the insufficient amount of sunlight reaching the lander,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jpl.Nasa.Gov |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-200 |title=''NASA-JPL'' ''Phoenix'' mission status report – heater shutdowns |publisher=Jpl.nasa.gov |date=October 29, 2008 |accessdate=July 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308184532/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-200 |archivedate=March 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as expected at this time of year. It was decided then to shut down the four heaters that keep the equipment warm, and upon bringing the spacecraft back from [[Safe mode (spacecraft)|safe mode]], commands were sent to turn off two of the heaters rather than only one as was originally planned for the first step. The heaters involved provide heat to the robotic arm, TEGA instrument and a pyrotechnic unit on the lander that were unused since landing, so these three instruments were also shut down.

On November 10, Phoenix Mission Control reported the loss of contact with the ''Phoenix'' lander; the last signal was received on November 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/MarsPhoenix/status/999393608 |title=''Twitter Announcement'' From Phoenix Mission Ops |publisher=Twitter.com |accessdate=July 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately prior, ''Phoenix'' sent its final message: "Triumph" in [[binary code]].&lt;ref name="WRD-20081110"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Madrigal |first=Alexis |title=Mars Phoenix Lander Runs Out of Juice |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/11/mars-phoenix-re/ |date=November 10, 2008 |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=February 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/MarsPhoenix/status/999383469 |title=''Twitter Announcement'' From Phoenix Mission Ops |publisher=Twitter.com |accessdate=July 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demise of the craft occurred as a result of a dust storm that reduced power generation even further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rayl |first=A.J.S. |title=Sun Sets on Phoenix, NASA Declares End of Mission |website=Planetary Society |publisher=[[Planetary Society]] |date=November 11, 2008 |url=http://www.planetary.org/news/2008/1111_Sun_Sets_on_Phoenix_NASA_Declares_End.html |accessdate=November 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230212102/http://www.planetary.org/news/2008/1111_Sun_Sets_on_Phoenix_NASA_Declares_End.html |archivedate=December 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the spacecraft's work ended, the analysis of data from the instruments was in its earliest stages.

==== Communication attempts 2010 ====
Though it was not designed to survive the frigid Martian winter, the spacecraft's [[Safe mode (spacecraft)|safe mode]] kept the option open to reestablish communications if the lander could recharge its batteries during the next Martian spring.&lt;ref name=Jan.11 /&gt; However, its landing location is in an area that is usually part of the [[Martian polar ice caps|north polar ice cap]] during the Martian winter, and the lander was seen from orbit to be encased in [[dry ice]].&lt;ref name="spcflite-now-encased"/&gt; It is estimated that, at its peak, the layer of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ice in the lander's vicinity would total about 30&amp;nbsp;grams/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is enough to make a dense slab of dry ice at least {{convert|7+1/2|in|cm}} thick.&lt;ref name=ice&gt;{{cite news|first=Kelly|last=Beatty|title=Phoenix Amid the Winter Snow|date=November 9, 2009|publisher=Sky &amp; Telescope Magazine|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/69627537.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130202090105/http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/69627537.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 2, 2013|accessdate=November 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered unlikely that the spacecraft could endure these conditions, as its fragile solar panels would likely break off under so much weight.&lt;ref name=ice /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lakdawalla|first=Emily|title=The end of Phoenix|website=The Planetary Society |publisher=[[Planetary Society]]|date=November 11, 2008|url=http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001735/|accessdate=November 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Results of the mission===

====Landscape====
Unlike some other places visited on Mars with landers (''[[Viking program|Viking]]'' and ''[[Mars Pathfinder|Pathfinder]]''), nearly all the rocks near ''Phoenix'' are small. For about as far as the camera can see, the land is flat, but shaped into polygons between 2–3 meters in diameter and are bounded by troughs that are 20&amp;nbsp;cm to 50&amp;nbsp;cm deep. These shapes are due to ice in the soil expanding and contracting due to major temperature changes. The microscope showed that the soil on top of the polygons is composed of flat particles (probably a type of clay) and rounded particles. Also, unlike other places visited on Mars, the site has no ripples or dunes.&lt;ref name=Smith2009 /&gt; Ice is present a few inches below the surface in the middle of the polygons, and along its edges, the ice is at least 8&amp;nbsp;inches deep. When the ice is exposed to the Martian atmosphere it slowly [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimates]].&lt;ref name="Space-20090702"&gt;{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Andrea |title=The Dirt on Mars Lander Soil Findings |url=http://www.space.com/6918-dirt-mars-lander-soil-findings.html |date=July 2, 2009 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=October 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[dust devil]]s were observed.

====Weather====
Snow was observed to fall from cirrus clouds. The clouds formed at a level in the atmosphere that was around −65&amp;nbsp;°C, so the clouds would have to be composed of water-ice, rather than carbon dioxide-ice (dry ice) because, at the low pressure of the Martian atmosphere, the temperature for forming carbon dioxide ice is much lower—less than −120&amp;nbsp;°C. It is now thought that water ice (snow) would have accumulated later in the year at this location.&lt;ref&gt;Witeway, J. et al. 2009. Mars Water-Ice Clouds and Precipitation. Science: 325. p68-70&lt;/ref&gt; This represents a milestone in understanding Martian weather. Wind speeds ranged from 11 to 58&amp;nbsp;km per hour. The usual average speed was 36&amp;nbsp;km per hour. These speeds seem high, but the atmosphere of Mars is very thin—less than 1% of the Earth's—and so did not exert much force on the spacecraft. The highest temperature measured during the mission was −19.6&amp;nbsp;°C, while the coldest was −97.7&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="asc-csa.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/media/news_releases/2009/0702.asp |title=Canadian Scientists Find Clues to the Water Cycle on Mars |accessdate=December 19, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705011110/http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/media/news_releases/2009/0702.asp |archivedate=July 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Climate cycles====
Interpretation of the data transmitted from the craft was published in the journal ''Science''. As per the peer reviewed data the presence of water ice has been confirmed and that the site had a wetter and warmer climate in the recent past. Finding [[calcium carbonate]] in the Martian soil leads scientists to think that the site had been wet or damp in the geological past. During seasonal or longer period diurnal cycles water may have been present as thin films. The tilt or obliquity of Mars changes far more than the Earth; hence times of higher humidity are probable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1172768 |pmid=19574384 |title=Evidence for Calcium Carbonate at the Mars Phoenix Landing Site |journal=Science |volume=325 |issue=5936 |pages=61–4 |year=2009 |last1=Boynton |first1=W.

The elements detected and measured in the samples are chloride, [[bicarbonate]], [[magnesium]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[calcium]], and [[sulfate]].&lt;ref name="Kounaves et al 2010 Geophysical Research Letters"/&gt; Further data analysis indicated that the soil contains soluble sulfate (SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) at a minimum of 1.1% and provided a refined formulation of the soil.&lt;ref name="Kounaves et al 2010 Geophysical Research Letters"/&gt;

Analysis of the ''Phoenix'' WCL also showed that the Ca(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the  soil has not interacted with liquid water of any form, perhaps for as long as 600 million years. If it had, the highly soluble Ca(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in contact with liquid water would have formed only CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

On August 1, 2008, ''Aviation Week'' reported that "''The White House has been alerted by NASA about plans to make an announcement soon on major new ''Phoenix'' lander discoveries concerning the "potential for life" on Mars, scientists tell Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Covault|first=Craig|title=White House Briefed On Potential For Mars Life|publisher=[[Aviation Week]]|date=August 1, 2008|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&amp;id=news/WH08018.xml&amp;headline=White%20House%20Briefed%20On%20Potential%20For%20Mars%20Life|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510020240/http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&amp;id=news%2FWH08018.xml&amp;headline=White%20House%20Briefed%20On%20Potential%20For%20Mars%20Life|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 10, 2011|accessdate=August 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a subdued media speculation on whether some evidence of past or present life had been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azonano.com/news.asp?newsID=7041|title=Speculation That The First Atomic Force Microscope on Mars Has Found Evidence of Life on Mars|date=August 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmannedspaceflight.com/index.php?showtopic=5365&amp;st=0|title=The MECA story, A place for speculation|date=July 21, 2008|publisher=unmannedspaceflight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universetoday.com/2008/08/02/the-white-house-is-briefed-phoenix-about-to-announce-potential-for-life-on-mars/|title=The White House is Briefed: ''Phoenix'' About to Announce "Potential For Life" on Mars|date=August 2, 2008|publisher=Universe Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; To quell the speculation, NASA released the preliminary findings stating that Mars soil contains [[perchlorate]] ({{chem|ClO|4}}) and thus may not be as life-friendly as thought earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-sci-phoenix6-2008aug06,0,4986721.story|title=Perchlorate found in Martian soil|date=August 6, 2008|work=Los Angeles Times|last=Johnson|first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080805192122.htm|publisher=Science Daily|date=August 6, 2008|title=Martian Life Or Not?

Laboratory research published in July 2017 demonstrated that when irradiated with a simulated Martian UV flux, perchlorates become bacteriocidal.&lt;ref name='bacteriocidal'&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=5500590 | pmid=28684729 | doi=10.1038/s41598-017-04910-3 | volume=7 | title=Perchlorates on Mars enhance the bacteriocidal effects of UV light | year=2017 | journal=Sci Rep | page=4662 | last1 = Wadsworth | first1 = J | last2 = Cockell | first2 = CS | bibcode=2017NatSR...7.4662W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other compounds of the Martian surface, [[iron oxide]]s and [[hydrogen peroxide]], act in synergy with irradiated perchlorates to cause a 10.8-fold increase in cell death when compared to cells exposed to UV radiation after 60 seconds of exposure.&lt;ref name='bacteriocidal'/&gt;  It was also found that abraded silicates (quartz and basalt) lead to the formation of toxic [[reactive oxygen species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bak | first1 = Ebbe N. | last2 = Larsen | first2 = Michael G. | last3 = Moeller | first3 = Ralf | last4 = Nissen | first4 = Silas B. | last5 = Jensen | first5 = Lasse R. | last6 = Nørnberg | first6 = Per | last7 = Jensen | first7 = Svend J.

[[Perchlorate]] (ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is a strong [[Oxidizing agent|oxidizer]], so it has the potential of being used for rocket fuel and as a source of oxygen for future missions.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2016/06/20/perchlorate-salt-mars-surface/#.WlTOTHnLghQ{{full citation needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, when mixed with water, perchlorate can greatly lower freezing point of water, in a manner similar to how salt is applied to roads to melt ice. So, perchlorate may be allowing small amounts of liquid water to form on the surface of Mars today. [[Gully (Mars)|Gullies]], which are common in certain areas of Mars, may have formed from perchlorate melting ice and causing water to erode soil on steep slopes.&lt;ref name=pmid19574385&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1172466 |pmid=19574385 |title=Detection of Perchlorate and the Soluble Chemistry of Martian Soil at the Phoenix Lander Site |journal=Science |volume=325 |issue=5936 |pages=64–7 |year=2009 |last1=Hecht |first1=M.

==''Phoenix'' DVD==
[[File:Phoenix mini-DVD on Mars.jpg|thumb|right|The "''Phoenix'' DVD" on Mars.]]

Attached to the deck of the lander (next to the US flag) is the "''Phoenix'' DVD",&lt;ref name="phoenix-dvd"/&gt; compiled by the [[Planetary Society]]. The disc contains ''Visions of Mars'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/messages/vom.html |title=Visions of Mars |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614101844/http://planetary.org/programs/projects/messages/vom.html |archivedate=June 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a multimedia collection of literature and art about the Red Planet. Works include the text of [[H.G. Wells]]' ''[[The War of the Worlds|War of the Worlds]]'' (and the [[The War of the Worlds (radio)|radio broadcast]] by [[Orson Welles]]), [[Percival Lowell]]'s ''Mars as the Abode of Life'' with a map of his [[Martian canal|proposed canals]], [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'', and [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Green Mars]]''. There are also messages directly addressed to future Martian visitors or settlers from, among others, [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]]. In 2006, The Planetary Society collected a quarter of a million names submitted through the Internet and placed them on the disc, which claims, on the front, to be "the first library on Mars." This ''Phoenix'' DVD is similar to the [[Voyager Golden Record]] that was sent on the ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]'' missions.

The ''Phoenix'' DVD is made of a special silica glass&lt;ref name="phoenix-dvd"&gt;{{cite web|title=The ''Phoenix'' DVD |website=Projects: Messages from Earth |url=http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/messages/phoenix_dvd.html |accessdate=August 6, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711160012/http://www.planetary.org/programs/projects/messages/phoenix_dvd.html |archivedate=July 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; designed to withstand the Martian environment, lasting for hundreds (if not thousands) of years on the surface while it awaits discoverers.

The text just below the center of the disk reads:

{{quote|This archive, provided to the NASA ''Phoenix'' mission by The Planetary Society, contains literature and art (Visions of Mars), greetings from Mars visionaries of our day, and names of 21st century Earthlings who wanted to send their names to Mars. This DVD-ROM is designed to be read on personal computers in 2007. Information is stored in a spiral groove on the disc. A laser beam can scan the groove when metallized or a microscope can be used. Very small bumps and holes represent the zeroes and ones of digital information. The groove is about 0.74 micrometres wide. For more information refer to the standards document ECMA-268 (80 mm DVD Read-Only Disk).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.methemedia.com/archives/13 Worldwide Me-the-Media Mars Scoop|Me the Media] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511090746/http://www.methemedia.com/archives/13 |date=May 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
