'''NSYNC''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|n|ˈ|s|ɪ|ŋ|k}}, {{IPAc-en|ɪ|n|-|}}; also stylized as '''*NSYNC''' or ''''N Sync''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Boy Bands' Most Wanted|last=Gray|first=Tyler|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=September 3, 2016|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[boy band]] formed in [[Orlando, Florida]], in 1995&lt;ref name="All"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NSYNC20"/&gt; and launched in Germany by BMG Ariola Munich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/nsync-mn0000516929/biography |title=Allmusic: *NSYNC (overview) |publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; NSYNC consisted of [[Justin Timberlake]], [[JC Chasez]], [[Chris Kirkpatrick]], [[Joey Fatone]], and [[Lance Bass]]. Their [['N Sync (album)|self-titled debut album]] was successfully released to European countries in 1997, and later debuted in the US market with the single "[[I Want You Back (NSYNC song)|I Want You Back]]".

After heavily publicized legal battles with their former manager [[Lou Pearlman]] and former record label [[Bertelsmann Music Group]], the group's second album, ''[[No Strings Attached (NSYNC album)|No Strings Attached]]'' (2000), sold over one million copies in one day and 2.42&amp;nbsp;million copies in one week, which was a record for [[25 (Adele album)|over fifteen years]].&lt;ref name="NSA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NSync's Biography on Billboard" /&gt; NSYNC's first two studio albums were both [[RIAA certification|certified Diamond]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). ''[[Celebrity (album)|Celebrity]]'' (2001) debuted with 1.8 million copies in its first week in the US. Singles such as "[[Bye Bye Bye]]", "[[This I Promise You]]", "[[Girlfriend (NSYNC song)|Girlfriend]]", "[[Pop (song)|Pop]]" and "[[It's Gonna Be Me]]" reached the top 10 in several international charts, with the last being a US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number one. In addition to a host of [[Grammy Award]] nominations, NSYNC has performed at the [[World Series]], the [[Super Bowl]] and the [[Olympic Games]], and sang or recorded with [[Elton John]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Celine Dion]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Nelly]], [[Left Eye]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[country music]] supergroup [[Alabama (band)|Alabama]], and [[Gloria Estefan]]. The group has received eight Grammy Award nominations.

NSYNC last recorded new material in 2002. The five members have reunited a couple of times, including at the [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards]] and to receive a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. The band completed five nationwide concert tours and has sold between 50 and 70 million records, becoming the [[Boy band#Best-selling boy bands|fifth-best-selling boy band]] in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Newman |first=Melinda |date=November 14, 2017 |title=*NSYNC And Epic Rights Join Together For Merchandise Line to Celebrate Band's 20th Anniversary: Exclusive |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8031516/nsync-and-epic-rights-join-together-for-merchandise-line-to-celebrate-bands |magazine=Billboard |accessdate=March 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/fashion/21lance.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1348221612-ktK210Jl2UyApyFCIwFy6w|title= A Boy-Band Grad's Next Act|first=Melena|last=Ryzik|work=The New York Times|date=October 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' recognized their instant success as one of the Top 25 Teen Idol Breakout Moments of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-top-25-teen-idol-breakout-moments-20120511/nsync-1999-20120511|title=The Top 25 Teen Idol Breakout Moments&amp;nbsp;– NSYNC|accessdate=December 15, 2014|work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justin Timberlake went on to become a ten-time Grammy Award winner throughout his solo career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.lexpress.fr/culture/musique/super-bowl-2018-depuis-le-nipplegate-les-mille-et-unes-vies-de-justin-timberlake_1980587.html|title=Super Bowl 2018: depuis le "nipplegate", les mille et unes vies de Justin Timberlake  |work=[[L'Express]]|first=Hermance|last=Murgue|date=February 4, 2018 |accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===1995–97: Formation and debut===
[[File:'N Sync Logo.svg|thumb|280px|NSYNC's wordmark logo]]
Chris Kirkpatrick, who had missed the cut for the [[Backstreet Boys]], met with [[Lou Pearlman]] in 1995 to talk about forming a second group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Tyler|title=The Hit Charade|year=2008|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-170186-3|page=129|quote=Kirkpatrick had just missed the cut for Backstreet Boys, and he came to Lou early in the discussions of forming a second boy band.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearlman said that he would finance the group if Kirkpatrick would find other young male singers. Pearlman looked through some tapes they had, and one of [[Justin Timberlake]] from ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'' caught his eye. During the time since ''The Mickey Mouse Club'' ended, Timberlake and [[JC Chasez]] both made demos together at Timberlake's house in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="RSWeird"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/n-sync-weird-scenes-inside-the-glitter-factory-245124/|title='N Sync: Weird Scenes Inside the Glitter Factory|last=Bozza|first=Anthony|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=March 30, 2000|access-date=March 29, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chasez initially left the show when he was seventeen to go to [[Los Angeles]], but felt cheated on after attempting to pursue music there.&lt;ref name="RSWeird"/&gt; The two eventually relocated to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] with Timberlake's friend while continuously writing songs and demo tracks. Timberlake received a phone call from Kirkpatrick and decided to join the group, recommending Chasez in the process, who was back home in [[Maryland]] saving up to return to Nashville.&lt;ref name="RSWeird"/&gt; The trio decided to venture in [[Orlando, Florida]] to search for a [[baritone]] player, where they encountered [[Joey Fatone]], who knew Kirkpatrick from their time working at [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The group finally recruited Jason Galasso as their [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] singer after several auditions.&lt;ref name="RSWeird"/&gt; NSYNC received its name after Justin Timberlake's mother commented on how "in sync" the group's singing voices were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0101/09/lkl.00.html |title='N Sync Discusses Their Rise to Stardom |publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group's name is also a play on the last letter of each of the initial members' names: Justi'''N''', Chri'''S''', Joe'''Y''', Jaso'''N'''&lt;!-- Do not change this into Lance's name as that contradicts the cited source from Gazette Review. --&gt;, and J'''C'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gazettereview.com/2016/12/happened-chris-kirkpatrick-news-updates/|title=What Happened to Chris Kirkpatrick&amp;nbsp;– Where's The NSYNC Member Now?
|first=Brooke|last=Carter|publisher=Gazette Review|date=December 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several weeks of rehearsals, the group set up a showcase and began planning to officially sign with Pearlman's Trans Continental Label. However, at the last minute, Galasso dropped out. He was not fond of the group's musical direction, claiming that being a [[teen idol]] was never a goal of his.&lt;ref name="Jason"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/driven/59733/episode_about.jhtml|title=VH1's Driven's *NSYNC Episode Summary|publisher=VH1|accessdate=January 4, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071223010856/http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/driven/59733/episode_about.jhtml| archivedate= December 23, 2007&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In need of a bass, the group auditioned several people without success. Timberlake soon called his vocal coach, who suggested a 16-year-old from [[Mississippi]] named [[Lance Bass]]. Bass flew to Orlando to audition and was immediately accepted into the group. He was nicknamed "Lansten" so they could keep the name 'NSYNC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/513952/n-syncs-james-lance-lansten-bass.jhtml|title= 'N Sync's James Lance "Lansten" Bass|first=Frank|last=Tortorici|publisher=MTV News|date=May 4, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there, Pearlman set the five boys up in a house in Orlando, Florida, where they rehearsed constantly, learning dance routines and vocal parts, and working on promotion for their first public performance at [[Pleasure Island (Walt Disney World)|Pleasure Island]] on October 22, 1995. Pearlman hired [[Johnny Wright (music manager)|Johnny Wright]] to manage the group, despite also managing the Backstreet Boys. NSYNC sent him a two-song demo-tape including "I'll Be Back for More" and "We Can Work It Out", which impressed him. The group performed for him and a group of [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] executives. Although the record company had some concerns with the band's name and Bass's dancing abilities (which eventually improved), they agreed to sign the group to [[Ariola Records|BMG Ariola Munich]] with Wright as their manager.&lt;ref name="billboard.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/nsync/261075#/artist/nsync/bio/261075|title=Artist Biography&amp;nbsp;– *NSYNC|work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being signed to BMG Ariola Munich, the group was sent to Sweden to begin working on their debut album with the help of producers such as [[Denniz Pop]], [[Max Martin]] and [[Andreas Carlsson]]. The album's official [[lead single]], "[[I Want You Back (NSYNC song)|I Want You Back]]", was released in Germany on October 7, 1996, and entered the top 10 in Germany on November 18, 1996.&lt;ref name="CHARTS-DEUTSCHLAND:Single Top 100 (18.11.1996)"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.offiziellecharts.de/charts/single/for-date-848304000000|title=CHARTSDEUTSCHLAND: Single Top 100 (18.11.1996)|publisher=Charts.de|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a record deal finally secured, the boys began touring first in German-speaking countries and later in other European and Asian territories.&lt;ref name="RSWeird"/&gt; Their [['N Sync (album)|self-titled debut album]] was initially released by BMG Ariola Munich on May 26, 1997, in Germany, and peaked at number one in the second week after its release.&lt;ref name="CHARTS-DEUTSCHLAND:Album Top 100 (09.06.1997)"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.offiziellecharts.de/charts/album/for-date-865839600000|title=ChartsDeutschland: Album Top 100 (09.06.1997)|publisher=Charts.de|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group soon became an overnight success throughout much of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/Music/*NSYNC/Biography/ |title=N Sync Pictures, biography, Discography, Filmography, News, Ringtones, Videos |publisher=Starpulse.com |accessdate=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album also charted successfully in both Switzerland and Austria eventually selling 820,000 units in GSA (Germany, Switzerland, Austria) region and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.swisscharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=%27N+Sync&amp;titel=%27N+Sync&amp;cat=a|title=*NSYNC&amp;nbsp;– *NSYNC (ALBUM)|publisher=Hung Medien|accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="N Sync's Inderect Path to the Top"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nw4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA7-IA5&amp;dq=*N%20SYNC%20sold%2056%20million&amp;lr&amp;rview=1&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=N Sync's Inderect Path to the Top|publisher=[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]|accessdate=May 12, 2010|date=March 20, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group released its second and third singles, "[[Tearin' Up My Heart]]" and "[[Here We Go (NSYNC song)|Here We Go]]", both of which managed to reach the top-10 in numerous countries in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=%27*NSYNC&amp;titel=Tearin%27+Up+My+Heart&amp;cat=s|title=*NSYNC&amp;nbsp;– Tearin' Up My Heart|publisher=GfK Dutch Charts|archivedate=July 15, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715232947/http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=%27*NSYNC&amp;titel=Tearin%27%20Up%20My%20Heart&amp;cat=s}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=%27N+Sync&amp;titel=Here+We+Go&amp;cat=s|title='N SYNC&amp;nbsp;– Here We Go|publisher=[[MegaCharts]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually released the following German exclusive singles, "[[For the Girl Who Has Everything (song)|For the Girl Who Has Everything]]" and "[[Together Again (NSYNC song)|Together Again]]" throughout the year.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

===1998–99: Breaking the American market and legal battle===
NSYNC captured the attention of [[Vincent DeGiorgio]], an A&amp;R rep for [[RCA Records]]. After seeing the group perform in Budapest, he eventually signed them to [[RCA]] in 1998. The American label had the group record some new tracks to adjust their album for the US market. The group released its debut American single, "[[I Want You Back (NSYNC song)|I Want You Back]]" on January 20, 1998. It reached number 13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hot 100&amp;nbsp;– the week of May 2, 1998|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1998-05-02|website=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; An album called ''[['N Sync (album)|'N Sync]]'' followed on March 24, 1998. Album sales were sluggish, debuting at number 82 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], but were helped when the [[Disney Channel]] aired a concert special on July 18, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='N Sync in Concert|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0166281/|publisher=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concert was first offered to the [[Backstreet Boys]], but they had to back out due to member [[Brian Littrell]] needing heart surgery, later doing their own special in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Franich |first=Darren |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/08/09/backstreet-boys-vs-n-sync/ |title=Backstreet Boys vs. 'N Sync: The great boy band debate &amp;#124; EW.com |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks before the concert, the album sat at number 85 on the albums chart; three weeks after the concert, the album reached number nine. The group's profile continued the rise with subsequent single release "Tearin' Up My Heart", which became a hit on pop radio and one of the "100 Greatest Songs of the 90s" according to VH1. Regular touring, including an opening spot on [[Janet Jackson]]'s [[The Velvet Rope Tour]], and television spots on shows like ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'' also bolstered sales for the album, which was eventually certified diamond for shipments in excess of 10 million units.&lt;ref name="riaa.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=&amp;artist=N%20Sync&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2008&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|title=Gold and platinum|publisher=RIAA|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924152059/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=&amp;artist=N%20Sync&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2008&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|archivedate=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 1998, the group released a holiday album, ''[[Home for Christmas (NSYNC album)|Home for Christmas]]''. The album peaked at number 7 and sold 2 million copies.&lt;ref name="riaa.com"/&gt; With this, NSYNC achieved the rare feat of having two albums in the Billboard Top 10 at the same time. 7 days later on November 16, 1998, NSYNC released ''[[The Winter Album (NSYNC album)|The Winter Album]]'' in Germany. One of the songs on the album "[[U Drive Me Crazy]]" was a major hit in Spain peaking at number 4. The group scored its first top 10 on the Hot 100 with their third single, "[[(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You]]", which peaked at number 8 in February 1999. Country group [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]] later re-recorded the song and released it as a single that featured vocals from NSYNC. The fourth and final single from the album, "[[I Drive Myself Crazy]]", was a modest chart hit, but a mainstay on ''[[Total Request Live]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} In September 1999, the group collaborated with Gloria Estefan on a song for the soundtrack for her movie ''[[Music of the Heart]]''. The track "[[Music of My Heart]]" reached number 2 on Billboard's Top-100 single chart and served as a stopgap between album releases.

In 1999, NSYNC entered a publicized legal battle with Lou Pearlman, due to what the group believed were illicit business practices on his part.&lt;ref name="Pearlman1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Manning|first=Kara|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1432531/19991124/n_sync.jhtml|title='N Sync Scores Small Victory As Legal Battle Begins|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=October 26, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071227170625/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1432531/19991124/n_sync.jhtml| archivedate= December 27, 2007&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; NSYNC sued Pearlman and his record company, Trans Continental, for [[fraud|defrauding]] the group of more than fifty percent of their earnings, rather than his promise of only receiving one-sixth of the profits, similar to his promise of one-sixth of the profits with the Backstreet Boys.&lt;ref name="Pearlman1" /&gt; The group threatened to leave and sign with Jive Records, which prompted Pearlman and RCA to countersue NSYNC for [[United States dollar|US$]]150&amp;nbsp;million and the use of the name.&lt;ref name="Countersuit"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolk|first= Josh|date=October 13, 1999|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,84723,00.html|title='N Court|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=December 3, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071221194407/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,84723,00.html| archivedate= December 21, 2007&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearlman's request for a preliminary injunction against the band was denied.&lt;ref name="Pearlman1" /&gt; After reaching a settlement out of court,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nsync/articles/story/5922830/n_sync_and_trans_con_settle Rolling Stone Dec 29, 1999] N Sync and Trans Con Settle ''N Sync vs. Trans Con: the music biz's nastiest legal battle of the decade''&lt;/ref&gt; NSYNC signed with Jive.&lt;ref name="Jive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Zomba-Records-Ltd-Company-History.html|title =Zomba Records, LTD: Company History|publisher=FundingUniverse.com|accessdate=December 4, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071201143052/http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Zomba-Records-Ltd-Company-History.html| archivedate= December 1, 2007&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===2000–01: ''No Strings Attached'' and groundbreaking success===
With their legal woes behind them, NSYNC refocused and worked on tracks for its second album. In January 2000, the group released "[[Bye Bye Bye]]", an upbeat dance track, which shot into the top 5 of the Hot 100 and spent 5 weeks atop the [[Hot 100 Airplay]] chart. The song is often considered the group's [[signature song]].

The accompanying album, ''[[No Strings Attached (NSYNC album)|No Strings Attached]]'', was released on March 21, 2000. It sold a record 2.42&amp;nbsp;million in its first week of release.&lt;ref name="NSA"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nypost/access/68886822.html?dids=68886822:68886822&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+20%2C+2000&amp;author=MARY+HUHN&amp;pub=New+York+Post&amp;desc=BACKSTREET+BOYS+WANT+TO+BEAT+*NSYNC%27S+MARK&amp;pqatl=google|title=Backstreet Boys Want to Beat *NSYNC'S Mark|date=November 20, 2000|work=New York Post|accessdate=August 29, 2010|first=Mary|last=Huhn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NSync's Biography on Billboard"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6524387/rewinding-the-charts-in-2000-n-sync-soared-with-no-strings|title=Rewinding the Charts: In 2000, 'N Sync Soared With 'No Strings'|work=[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]|accessdate=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2000, it had sold over 9.9&amp;nbsp;million copies.&lt;ref name="'N Sync's 'No Strings Attached' Is Top Album of the 2000s1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/4167.html|title=Linkin Park beats out pop acts for No. 1 album of 2001|publisher=[[LiveDaily]]|date=January 4, 2002|accessdate=February 12, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113060816/http://livedaily.com/news/4167.html| archivedate=January 13, 2010&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''No Strings Attached'' was the best-selling album of 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Skanse |first=Richard |title=N Sync, Eminem, Britney Top Y2K Album Sales |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/n-sync-eminem-britney-top-y2k-album-sales-20010103 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=January 3, 2000 |accessdate=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second-best selling album of the decade in the US behind [[The Beatles]]' ''[[1 (The Beatles album)|1]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6502283/nsync-no-strings-attached-anniversary-best-song|title=*NSYNC's 'No Strings Attached' Turns 15: What's the Best Song on the Album?|work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2012, ''No Strings Attached'' was the eighth best selling album of the [[Nielsen SoundScan|SoundScan]] era, and received a [[RIAA certification|Diamond certification]] from RIAA for sales of over 11,099,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=2&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=&amp;artist=N%20Sync&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2008&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|title=Gold and Platinum|publisher=RIAA|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924154336/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=2&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=&amp;artist=N%20Sync&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2008&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|archivedate=September 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was all-time bestselling pre-ordered album on Amazon.com.&lt;ref name="MEDIA ALERT/'N Sync Breaks Sales Records AtAmazon.com."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail/retailers-book-music-hobby-stores-stores/6414390-1.html|title=Media Alert/'N Sync Breaks Sales Records at Amazon.com| publisher=[[AllBusiness.com]]|date=March 31, 2000|accessdate=May 9, 2010|archivedate=January 8, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108174404/http://www.allbusiness.com/retail/retailers-book-music-hobby-stores-stores/6414390-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second single, "[[It's Gonna Be Me]]", became the group's first number one single in the U.S. and remained at the top position on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 from July 29 to August 11, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/archive/charts/2000/hot-100 "The Hot 100&amp;nbsp;– 2000 Archive"], ''The Billboard Hot 100'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The third and final single, "[[This I Promise You]]" reached the top five on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart. They performed the Spanish version of the song "Yo Te Voy Amar" at the [[Latin Grammy]]s in 2001. The group also embarked on a World ''[[No Strings Attached Tour]]'' that year. The adventures of preparing for the tour were featured on an MTV special "Making the Tour", which was later released on DVD. The tour was then featured on a HBO special, which aired the same week the group's song "It's Gonna Be Me" hit number one on the charts. The group then went on the second leg of the tour in the fall and performed one last show in 2001 for the "[[Rock in Rio]]" concert. The group also released ''Live From Madison Square Garden'', a home video release of its HBO Special. NSYNC and [[Aerosmith]] co-headlined the [[Super Bowl XXXV]] halftime show, titled "The Kings of Rock and Pop", with appearances from Britney Spears, [[Mary J.

==Artistry==
Their debut studio album ''[['N Sync (album)|'N Sync]]'' (1997) featured [[Four on the floor (music)|four-on-the-floor]] [[Europop]] beats with the midtempo [[soft pop|soft-pop]] singles "I Want You Back" and "Tearin' Up My Heart," that recalled a production similar to [[Ace of Base]].&lt;ref name="npr 20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bb 20"/&gt; ''[[No Strings Attached (NSYNC album)|No Strings Attached]]'' (2000) was noted as "an incremental step away" from [[teen pop]]'s "softer side", as it featured ballads written by [[Adult_contemporary_music#1980s:_Adult_contemporary_succeeds_as_radio_format|80s adult contemporary]] singer [[Richard Marx]] and prolific songwriter [[Diane Warren]]. Primarily a pop album, it comprised a blend of [[new jack swing]] revivalism, uptempo [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] and hip-hop influences. Lyrically, the lead single "[[Bye Bye Bye]]"'s kiss-off message and self-assurance saw the group departing from the "lovesick" formula of their debut.&lt;ref name="npr 20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bb 20"/&gt; ''[[Celebrity (album)|Celebrity]]'' (2001) was mainly a pop/R&amp;B record with [[electronica]] elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/nsync-celebrity |title=*Nsync: ''Celebrity'' |work=[[Slant Magazine]] |date=July 22, 2001 |accessdate=July 28, 2015 |last=Cinquemani |first=Sal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked NSYNC as the best boy band of the period late 90s and 2000s; editor Madelne Boardman stated, "the group has a spot in pop history more than a decade late."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ew.com/gallery/ranking-boy-bands/1-nsync |title=Ranking the Best Boy Bands of the '90s and '00s |last=Boardman |first=Madeline |date=January 25, 2016 |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated it was one of the two boy bands "that dominated the late '90s and early '00s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/big-time-rush-one-direction-the-wanted-the-boy-band-is-making-a-comeback/2012/03/20/gIQAxsvCSS_story.html |title=Big Time Rush, One Direction, the Wanted: The boy band is making a comeback |publisher=The Washington Post |date=March 22, 2012 |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', ''No Strings Attached'' was the top album of the 2000s (decade),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/eminem-billboard-artist-decade-92322 |title=Eminem is Billboard artist of the decade |date=December 14, 2009 |first=Caulfield |last=Keith |work=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ''[[The Independent]]'' listing it among the albums "that marked the decade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/albums-that-marked-the-decade-5514750.html |title=Albums that marked the decade |date=December 29, 2009 |work=The Independent |accessdate=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Billboard'' also ranked the group at number four on their list of the biggest boy bands (from the period 1987–2012) according to chart performance, with the staff writing, "despite having one of the most short-lived boy band careers, 'N Sync was arguably the most famous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/list/502728/10-biggest-boy-bands-1987-2012 |title=10 Biggest Boy Bands (1987–2012) |date=March 27, 2012 |work=Billboard |accessdate=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a retrospective article about ''No Strings Attached''{{'}}s 20th anniversary, [[NPR]]'s writer Maria Sherman deemed it musically "the sound of a new millennium", commercially an "industry peak", and the group as "one of the last artists to benefit so greatly from the industry bubble before its spectacular burst," referring to the following [[post-9/11]] era. The writer also noted their sophomore album to be relevant to the [[2020 in American music|pop market of 2020]]: "a union of [[Max Martin|Swedish pop songcraft]] with R&amp;B and hip-hop's flow and bounce; an eagerness to explore mature themes and styles; an understanding that dance and visual presentation can turn stars into icons."&lt;ref name="npr 20"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2020/03/20/818464377/nsync-no-strings-attached-20th-anniversary-timberlake-backstreet|title=The Future According To NSYNC: 20 Years Of 'No Strings Attached'|work=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Billboard'' stated that their sophomore album's production and writing "represented a sonic shift for all of pop music at the [[2000 in music|turn of the millennium]]," while noting, "before ''No Strings Attached'', none of the major teen pop albums of the era had featured guest rappers or name producers from the [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] world, and virtually every one that came after did." The magazine's writer Al Shipley commented that the album cover and the video for the lead single "[[Bye Bye Bye]]" made them–not the first act but the one that "took things a step further" regarding building an album "around the theme of taking control of their career."&lt;ref name="bb 20"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9344009/nsync-no-strings-attached-2000-sound-of-pop|title=*NSYNC’s 'No Strings Attached' Shook Up the Sound of Y2K Pop|work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article of ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' noted that the group "were deeply ingrained within the ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]'' universe", the [[MTV]] fan-voted video countdown where they had the most number-one videos for a group and second-most overall, which became "ground zero" for "America's adolescent culture war." The website's editor commented, "to be a teenager at the turn of the millennium was to be inundated with boy bands and pop princesses, and *NSYNC were among the most dominant of them all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.stereogum.com/2075695/nsync-no-strings-attached-turns-20/franchises/the-week-in-pop/|title=*NSYNC Nailed The Boy Band Blueprint With No Strings Attached|work=Consequence of Sound}}&lt;/ref&gt; As NSYNC propelled the solo stardom of Timberlake, the website noted, "[his] solo success is the exception, not the rule", as other contemporary boy bands "failed to produce a solo star."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/harry-styles-solo-career/|title=Harry Styles Has Weathered the Post-Boy Band Storm Better Than Most|work=Consequence of Sound}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several acts have cited the group as an influence, including [[Kelsea Ballerini]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/see-kelsea-ballerini-cover-britney-spears-nsync-in-nineties-medley-20150723|title=See Kelsea Ballerini Cover Britney Spears, N'Sync in Nineties Medley|date=July 23, 2015|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Selena Gomez]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/31/selena-gomez-revival-preview?xid=IFT-Section|title=Selena Gomez talks new album: Inside the laid-back Mexico sessions for 'Revival'|last1=O'Donnell|first1=Kevin|date=August 31, 2015|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=January 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meghan Trainor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7530699/meghan-trainor-all-about-that-bass-interview|title=Meghan Trainor Talks 'All About That Bass' And Her Upcoming Album &amp; Offers Up A Cotton Candy Giveaway: Interview|first=Robie|last=Daw|publisher=Idolator.
