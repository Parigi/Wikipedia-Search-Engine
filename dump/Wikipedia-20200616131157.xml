[[File:Orphic-egg.png|thumb|[[Jacob Bryant]]'s [[Orphic Egg]] (1774)]]The '''world egg''', '''cosmic egg''' or '''mundane egg''' is a [[mythology|mythological]] [[Motif (literature)|motif]] found in the [[Cosmogony|cosmogonies]] of many [[culture]]s  that descends from the [[Proto-Indo-European mythology|proto-Indo-European culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leeming |first1=David Adams |title=Creation Myths of the World: An Encyclopedia, Book 1 |date=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=144 |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=9I62BcuPxfYC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=world+egg+indo+european&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4YNySlb_dO&amp;sig=ATKsPAzPzGNEqD5Y9LuSM0ejFNo&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEiqjNz7fcAhUOaFAKHf5QAGAQ6AEIbDAS#v=onepage&amp;q=world%20egg%20indo%20european&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other cultures and [[civilization]]s. Typically, the world egg is a beginning of some sort, and the [[universe]] or some primordial being comes into existence by "hatching" from the [[egg]], sometimes lain on the [[:wikt:primordial|primordial]] waters of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;Anna‐Britta Hellborn, "The creation egg", ''Ethnos: Journal of Anthropology'', 1, 1963, pp. 63-105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/81/11799.html |title=Brewer, E.

== Vedic mythology ==
[[Image:HinducosmoMap3.svg|thumb|Vivasvan, Rahu, Bhūmi, Naraka, Ananta, Garbhodaksayi Vishnu|150px]]

[[Image:Hinducosm Map1.svg|thumb|This is one of many material universes, Brahmandas, which expand from Mahavishnu when He breathes.|150px|alt=One Brahmanda]]

The earliest idea of "egg-shaped cosmos" comes from some of the [[Sanskrit]] scriptures. The Sanskrit term for it is [[Brahmanda]] (ब्रह्माण्ड) which is derived from two words - '[[Brahma]]' (ब्रह्मा) the creator god in Hinduism and 'anda' (अण्ड) meaning 'egg'. Certain [[Purana]]s such as the [[Brahmanda Purana]] speak of this in detail.

The [[Rig Veda]] (RV 10.121) uses a similar name for the source of the universe: [[Hiranyagarbha]] (हिरण्यगर्भ) which literally means "golden fetus" or "golden womb" and is associated with the universal source [[Brahman]] where the whole of all existence is believed to be supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Roshen Dalal]] |title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zrk0AwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=2014}} Entry: "Hiranyagarbha"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lochtefeld |first=James G. |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kl0DYIjUPgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=[[The Rosen Publishing Group]] |year=2002 |isbn=978-0823931798 |volume=1 |page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Upanishads]] elaborate that the [[Hiranyagarbha]] floated around in emptiness for a while, and then broke into two halves which formed [[Dyaus]] (Heaven) and [[Prithvi]] (Earth). The Rig Veda has a similar coded description of the division of the universe in its early stages.

== Zoroastrianism mythology ==
According to Zoroastrian cosmology, the period of (material) creation, also to last 3,000 years, began after the treaty, when [[Ahura Mazda|Ohrmazd]] recited the [[Ahuna Vairya|Ahunwar]] (Av. Ahuna Vairiia) prayer, revealing to [[Angra Mainyu|Ahriman]] his ultimate defeat and causing him to fall back into the darkness in a stupor, which lasted for the entire period of the creation.  During this time Ohrmazd fashioned his creations in material (''gētīg'') form, by celebrating a “spiritual ''[[yasna]]''”.  He placed each creation under the protection of one of the seven [[Amesha Spenta|Amahraspands]] (Av. Aməša Spənta).  First he created the sky (protected by [[Shahrevar|Šahrewar]], Av. Xšaθra Vairiia), which enclosed the world like the shell of an egg.  The second creation was water (protected by [[Haurvatat|Hordād]], Av. Haurvatāt), which filled the lower half of the “egg.”  The third creation, earth (protected by Spandārmad, Av. [[Spenta Armaiti|Spənta Ārmaiti]]), shaped like a flat disk, floated on the primeval waters.  On it stood the fourth, fifth, and sixth creations, respectively the single plant or tree (protected by [[Ameretat|Amurdād]];  Av. Amərətāt), the uniquely created bull (protected by [[Bahman|Wahman]], Av. Vohu Manah), and the first man, [[Keyumars|Gayōmard]] (Av. Gaiiō.marətan, protected by Ohrmazd himself).  The seventh creation, fire (protected by [[Asha Vahishta|Ardwahišt]];  Av. Aṧa Vahišta), was said to have permeated all other creations. During the 3,000 years of the period of material creation these creations were motionless, and the sun stood still in the middle of the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cosmogony-i|title=COSMOGONY AND COSMOLOGY i. In Zoroastrianism/Mazdaism|website=Encyclopædia Iranica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Greek mythology ==
The '''[[Orphic Egg]]''' in the ancient Greek [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic tradition]] is the cosmic egg from which hatched the primordial [[Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] deity [[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]]/Protogonus (variously equated also with [[Zeus]], [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], [[Eros]], [[Erikepaios]] and [[Bromius]]) who in turn created the other gods.&lt;ref&gt;West, M. L. (1983) ''The Orphic Poems''. Oxford:Oxford University Press. p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; The egg is often depicted with a serpent wound around it.

Many threads of earlier myths are apparent in the new tradition. [[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]] was believed to have been hatched from the [[World-Egg]] of [[Chronos]] (Time) and [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]] (Necessity) or [[Nyx]] (Night). His older wife [[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]] called him Protogenus. As she created nighttime, he created daytime. He also created the method of creation by mingling. He was made the ruler of the deities and passed the [[sceptre]] to Nyx. This new Orphic tradition states that Nyx later gave the sceptre to her son [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranos]] before it passed to [[Cronus]] and then to Zeus, who retained it.

== Egyptian mythology ==
The [[ancient Egypt]]ians accepted multiple creation myths as valid, including those of the [[Hermopolis (Lower Egypt)|Hermopolitan]], Heliopolitan, and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphite]] theologies. Under the Hermopolitan theology, there is the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]], which represents the conditions before the [[Ancient Egyptian deities|gods]] were created (Van Dijk, 1995).
An aspect within the Ogdoad is the Cosmic Egg, from which all things are born. Life comes from the Cosmic Egg; the sun god [[Ra]] was born from the primordial egg in a stage known as the first occasion (Dunand, 2004).

== Phoenician mythology ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
A philosophical creation story traced to "the cosmogony of ''[[Taautus]]'', whom [[Philo of Byblos]] explicitly identified with the Egyptian [[Thoth]]&amp;mdash;"the first who thought of the invention of letters, and began the writing of records"&amp;mdash; which begins with [[Erebus]] and Wind, between which ''[[Eros (god)|Eros]]'' 'Desire' came to be. From this was produced ''Môt'' which seems to be the Phoenician/Ge'ez/Hebrew/Arabic/Ancient Egyptian word for 'Death' but which the account says may mean 'mud'. In a mixed confusion, the germs of life appear, and intelligent animals called ''Zophasemin'' (explained probably correctly as 'observers of heaven') formed together as an egg, perhaps. The account is not clear. Then Môt burst forth into light and the heavens were created and the various elements found their stations.

Following the etymological line of [[Jacob Bryant]] one might also consider with regard to the meaning of ''Môt'', that according to the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians ''[[Ma'at]]'' was the personification of the fundamental order of the universe, without which all of creation would perish. She was also considered the wife of Thoth.

== Chinese mythology ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
In the myth of [[Pangu]], developed by [[Taoist]] [[monk]]s hundreds of years after [[Lao Zi]], the universe began as an egg that symbolizes the primordial state of [[Taiji_(philosophy)|Taiji]].  A primeval [[Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] [[giant]] named [[Pangu]], born inside the egg, broke it into two halves: the upper half became the sky, while the lower half became the earth.  As the god grew taller, the sky and the earth grew thicker and were separated further.  Finally Pangu died and his body parts became different parts of the earth.

== Finnish mythology ==
In the ''[[Kalevala]]'', the [[Finnish mythology|Finnish]] [[national epic]], there is a myth of the world being created from the fragments of an egg laid by a [[diving duck]] on the knee of [[Ilmatar]], [[goddess]] of the air:

: ''One egg's lower half transformed''
: ''And became the earth below,''
: ''And its upper half transmuted''
: ''And became the sky above;''
: ''From the yolk the sun was made,''
: ''Light of day to shine upon us;''
: ''From the white the moon was formed,''
: ''Light of night to gleam above us;''
: ''All the colored brighter bits''
: ''Rose to be the stars of heaven''
: ''And the darker crumbs changed into''
: ''Clouds and cloudlets in the sky.''

In many original folk poems, the duck - or sometimes an eagle - laid its eggs on the knee of [[Väinämöinen]].&lt;ref&gt;Martti Haavio: Väinämöinen: Suomalaisten runojen keskushahmo. Porvoo: WSOY, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

== Polynesian mythology ==
In [[Cook Islands mythology]], deep within [[Avaiki]] (the Underworld), a place described as resembling a vast hollow coconut shell, there dwelt in the deepest depths, the primordial mother goddess, [[Varima-te-takere]]. Her domain was described as being so narrow, that her knees touched her chin. It was from this place that she created the first man, [[Avatea]], a god of light, a hybrid being half man and half fish. He was sent to the Upperworld to shine light in the land of men, and his eyes were believed to be the sun and the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[William Wyatt Gill]]|title=Myths and Songs from the South Pacific|url=https://archive.org/stream/mythsandsongsfro013889mbp#page/n27/mode/2up|date=1876|publisher=London: Henry S. King &amp; Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Samoan and Tahitian mythology, all existence began inside an egg-like shell called Rumia. The first being to exist within Rumia was Tangaloa. Tangaloa instigated the creation of many aspects of reality, the atea/lagi heavens, the papa earth, and additional living creatures (the atua / gods) tightly compressed within the shell. The new creatures eventually worked to release the shell and pushed the heavens and earth apart, resulting in the universe as we know it.

== Dogon mythology ==

"''In the beginning, Amma, alone, was in the shape of an egg: the four collar bones were fused, dividing the egg into air, earth, fire, and water, establishing also the four cardinal directions. Within this cosmic egg was the material and the structure of the universe, and the 266 signs that embraced the essence of all things. The first creation of the world by Amma was, however, a failure. The second creation began when Amma planted a seed within herself, a seed that resulted in the shape of man. But in the process of its gestation, there was a flaw, meaning that the universe would now have within it the possibilities for incompleteness. Now the egg became two placentas, each containing a set of twins, male and female. After sixty years, one of the males, Ogo, broke out of the placenta and attempted to create his own universe, in opposition to that being created by Amma. But he was unable to say the words that would bring such a universe into being. He then descended, as Amma transformed into the earth the fragment of placenta that went with Ogo into the void. Ogo interfered with the creative potential of the earth by having incestuous relations with it. His counterpart, Nommo, a participant in the revolt, was then killed by Amma, the parts of his body cast in all directions, bringing a sense of order to the world. When, five days later, Amma brought the pieces of Nommo's body together, restoring him to life, Nommo became ruler of the universe. He created four spirits, the ancestors of the [[Dogon people]]; Amma sent Nommo and the spirits to earth in an ark, and so the earth was restored. Along the way, Nommo uttered the words of Amma, and the sacred words that create were made available to humans. In the meantime, Ogo was transformed by Amma into Yuguru, the Pale Fox, who would always be alone, always be incomplete, eternally in revolt, ever wandering the earth seeking his female soul. ''" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Amma and the Egg that Contains the Universe |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095408829 |website=Oxford Reference |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Representations ==
* In the [[temple]] of [[Daibod]], [[Japan]], it is represented as a nest egg floating in an expanse of water.
* On the island of [[Cyprus]], the egg is represented as a gigantic egg-shaped vase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=January 16, 2004|others=Chapter 4|title=Ophiolatreia|url=http://www.northvegr.org/lore/serpent/00403.php|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040116104126/http://www.northvegr.org/lore/serpent/00403.php|archive-date=2004-01-16|access-date=|website=Northvegr: The Northern Way|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern mythology ==
In 1955 poet and writer Robert Graves published the mythography ''[[The Greek Myths]]'', a compendium of Greek mythology normally published in two volumes. Within this work Graves' imaginatively reconstructed "Pelasgian creation myth" features a supreme [[creator deity|creatrix]], [[Eurynome]], "The Goddess of All Things",&lt;ref name="Graves1955"/&gt; who arose naked from [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]] to part sea from sky so that she could dance upon the waves. Catching the [[Anemoi#Boreas|north wind]] at her back and, rubbing it between her hands, she warms the ''[[pneuma]]'' and [[spontaneous generation|spontaneously generates]] the serpent [[Ophion]], who mates with her. In the form of a dove upon the waves, she lays the Cosmic Egg and bids Ophion to incubate it by coiling seven times around until it splits in two and hatches "all things that exist... sun, moon, planets, stars, the earth with its mountains and rivers, its trees, herbs, and living creatures".&lt;ref name="Graves1955"&gt;{{cite book |last=Graves |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Graves |year=1990 |origyear=1955 |title=The Greek Myths |volume=1 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-001026-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xKSxQQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In modern cosmology ==
The concept was resurrected by modern [[science]] in the 1930s and explored by theoreticians during the following two decades.  The idea comes from a perceived need to reconcile [[Edwin Hubble]]'s observation of an [[expanding universe]] (which was also predicted from [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s equations of [[general relativity]] by [[Alexander Friedmann]]) with the notion that the [[universe]] must be eternally old. Current [[Physical cosmology|cosmological models]] maintain that 13.8 billion years ago, the entire mass of the universe was compressed into a [[gravitational singularity]], the so-called cosmic egg, from which it expanded to its current state (following the [[Big Bang]]).

[[Georges Lemaître]] proposed in 1927 that the [[cosmos]] originated from what he called the ''primeval atom''.

In the late 1940s, [[George Gamow]]'s assistant [[Cosmology|cosmological]] researcher [[Ralph Alpher]], proposed the name [[ylem]] for the primordial substance that existed between the [[Big Crunch]] of the previous universe and the [[Big Bang]] of our own universe.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cosmos''--''Voyage Through the Universe'' series, New York:1988 Time-Life Books Page 75&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ylem'' is closely related to the concept of [[supersymmetry]].  &lt;ref&gt;Edward Harrison: Masks of the Universe: Changing Ideas on the Nature of the Cosmos, Cambridge University Press, 08.05.2003, p. 224 ([https://books.google.de/books?id=tSowGCP0kMIC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;lpg=PA224&amp;dq=ylem+supersymmetrie&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p36VfOjibz&amp;sig=LVrnIUJVcagTU5MYYDVf7b7B5-U&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiAr7yZtJfdAhVGPBoKHfyODR4Q6AEwBnoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ylem%20supersymmetrie&amp;f=false online]) &lt;/ref&gt;
