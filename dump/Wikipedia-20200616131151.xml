[[Flamingo]]s are gregarious wading birds, usually {{convert|3|to|5|ft|m|1}} tall, found in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Flamingos filter-feed on shellfish and algae.

Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the [[Rail (bird)|rails]], [[crake]]s, [[coot]]s and [[Gallinula|gallinule]]s. Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers.

==Sandpipers and allies==
'''Order''': [[Charadriiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Scolopacidae]]

Scolopacidae is a large diverse family of small to medium-sized shorebirds including the [[sandpiper]]s, [[curlew]]s, [[godwit]]s, [[Tringa|shanks]], [[Tattler (bird)|tattlers]], [[woodcock]]s, [[snipe]]s, [[dowitcher]]s and [[phalarope]]s. The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil.

They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. [[Tern]]s are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. [[Skimmer (bird)|Skimmer]]s are a small family of tropical tern-like birds. They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for small fish.

'''Order''': [[Phaethontiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Phaethontidae]]

[[Tropicbird]]s are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings.

*[[Red-billed tropicbird]], ''Phaethon aethereus''

==Albatrosses==
'''Order''': [[Procellariiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Diomedeidae]]

The albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds, and the great albatrosses from the genus ''Diomedea'' have the largest wingspans of any extant birds.

==Southern storm-petrels==
'''Order''': [[Procellariiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Oceanitidae]]

The southern storm-petrels are relatives of the [[petrel]]s and are the smallest seabirds. They feed on [[plankton]]ic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes [[bat]]-like.

*[[Wilson's storm-petrel]], ''Oceanites oceanicus''

==Northern storm-petrels==
'''Order''': [[Procellariiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Hydrobatidae]]

Though the members of this family are similar in many respects to the southern storm-petrels, including their general appearance and habits, there are enough genetic differences to warrant their placement in a separate family.

==Anhingas==
'''Order''': [[Suliformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Anhingidae]]

Anhingas or darters are often called "snake-birds" because of their long thin neck, which gives a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged. The males have black and dark-brown plumage, an erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage especially on the neck and underparts. The darters have completely webbed feet and their legs are short and set far back on the body. Their plumage is somewhat permeable, like that of cormorants, and they spread their wings to dry after diving.

The family Corvidae includes [[crow]]s, [[raven]]s, [[jay]]s, [[chough]]s, [[magpie]]s, [[treepie]]s, [[nutcracker (bird)|nutcracker]]s and [[ground jay]]s. Corvids are above average in size among the Passeriformes, and some of the larger species show high levels of intelligence.

Ancient Egyptian names for crow or raven species include very possibly ''gbgb/gbg3''; this bird is once called ''3pd km'' or 'black bird', while its eggs could apparently be gathered according to a medical papyrus, and therefore points to a breeding bird of Egypt. In demotic an ''ʾbḳ''-bird can be determined by help of the existence of Coptic ''abook'' 'Crow, raven'. But perhaps the latter is also a derivatiuon of the bird name kbk.

Late Egyptian, male personal names include a Gebgeb, possible 'the crow', perhaps because the baby had black hair or a dark complexion. (drs. Carles Wolterman, Amstelveen, Holland)
