In the [[History of Spain#Spanish Civil War (1936–1939)|history of Spain]], the '''White Terror''' (also known as the '''Francoist Repression''', ''la Represión franquista'') describes the [[political repression]], including [[Capital punishment|executions]] and [[rape]]s, which were carried out by the [[National faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist faction]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–39), as well as during the first nine years of the [[Francoist Spain|regime]] of General [[Francisco Franco]].&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|89–94}} In the 1936–45 period, [[Francoist Spain]] had many official enemies: Loyalists to the [[Second Spanish Republic]] (1931–39), [[Liberal Party (Spain, 1880)|Liberals]], [[Socialism|socialists]] of different stripes, [[Protestants]], [[Atheism|atheists]], [[intellectuals]], [[homosexual]]s, [[Freemason]]s, and [[Basque nationalism|Basque]], [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan]], and [[Galician nationalism|Galician nationalists]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 15th ed., vol. 21, p. 836.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|52}}&lt;ref name=Graham&gt;{{cite book|last=Graham|first=Helen|title=The Spanish Civil War: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://archive.org/details/spanishcivilwarv00grah_0|url-access=registration|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-280377-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|136}}

Fascists viewed the [[purge|purging]] of [[Left wing|leftists]] from Spain as the [[Reactionary|political reaction]] that was required in order to re-establish the [[Monarchy of Spain|monarchy]] in place of the Second Republic. The Francoist Repression was motivated by the right-wing notion of a ''limpieza social'', a cleansing of society. This meant the killing of people viewed as [[enemies of the state]] began immediately upon the Nationalists' capture of a place.&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|98}} Ideologically, the Roman Catholic Church [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimized]] the killing by the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] (national police) and the ''[[Falange]]'' as the defense of [[Christendom]].&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|88-9}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://segurquetomba.wordpress.com/2009/11/22/el-silencio-de-los-obispos-la-iglesia-catolica-de-espana-y-los-ninos-perdidos-del-franquismo-un-ano-despues/|title=El silencio de los obispos: La Iglesia Católica de España y los niños perdidos del franquismo un año después.|work=En el país de los niños perdidos|accessdate=8 May 2015|date=2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout Franco's rule (1 October 1936 – 20 November 1975), the [[Law of Political Responsibilities]] ''(Ley de Responsabilidades Políticas)'', promulgated in 1939, reformed in 1942, and in force until 1966, gave legalistic [[Color (law)|color of law]] to the political repression that characterized the dismantling of the Second Republic;&lt;ref name="CH-sa"/&gt; and served to punish Loyalist Spaniards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://losojosdehipatia.com.es/cultura/historia/la-ley-de-responsabilidades-politicas-un-arma-mas-de-represion-durante-el-franquismo/|title=La Ley de Responsabilidades Políticas, un arma más de represión durante el franquismo|work=Los ojos de Hipatia|accessdate=8 May 2015|date=2013-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians consider the White Terror's death toll (usually estimated between 100,000 and 200,000) to be greater than the death toll of the corresponding [[Red Terror (Spain)|Red Terror]] (between 40,000 and 110,905&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wojna domowa w Hiszpanii 1936-1939|last=Zubiński, Tadeusz (1953- ).|date=cop. 2015|publisher=Wydawnictwo Poznańskie|others=Wydawnictwo Poznańskie (1993- ).|isbn=978-83-7177-973-2|location=Poznań|oclc=903377340}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opinie.wp.pl/francisco-franco-jedyny-przywodca-ktory-pokonal-stalina-6126039183566977a|title=Francisco Franco – jedyny przywódca, który pokonał Stalina|last=Zychowicz|first=Piotr|date=20 March 2015 |website=Historia do Rzeczy|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Alfonso XIIIdeEspaña.jpg|thumb|The end of the monarchy of King Alfonso XIII (r. 1886–1931) precipitated Gen. Francisco Franco's reactionary ''coup d'état'' (17 July 1936) against the Second Spanish Republic (1931–39), which launched the Spanish Civil War (1936–39)]]

After the flight of King [[Alfonso XIII]] (r. 1886–1931), the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was established on 14 April 1931, led by President [[Niceto Alcalá-Zamora]], whose government instituted a program of [[secularism|secular]] reforms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohn|first=George|title=Dictionary of Wars, Third Edition|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2006|isbn=9781438129167}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|517–8}} which included [[agrarian reform]],&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|22,25}}, the [[separation of church and state]],&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;{{rp|7}}, the right to [[divorce]],&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|54}}, [[women's suffrage]] (November 1933),&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;{{rp|11}}, the socio-political reformation of the [[Spanish Republican Army|Spanish Army]],&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|47}} and political [[autonomy]] for [[Catalonia]]&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|22}} and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] (October 1936).&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|223}}President Alcalá-Zamora's reforms to Spanish society were continually blocked by the right-wing parties and rejected by the far-left-wing National Confederation of Labour (CNT, ''[[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]]''). The Second Spanish Republic suffered attacks from the right wing (the failed ''coup d'état'' of [[Sanjurjo]] in 1932), and the left wing (the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934]]), whilst enduring the economic impact of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|21}}&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Ian|title=The Assassination of Federico García Lorca|url=https://archive.org/details/assassinationoff00gibs|url-access=registration|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1983|isbn=0-14-006473-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}}

After the general election in February 1936 was won by the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] — a coalition of leftist parties ([[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE), [[Republican Left (Spain)|Republican Left]] (IR), [[Republican Union (Spain, 1934)|Republican Union]] (UR), [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party]] (PCE), [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification]] (POUM), [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] (ERC) and others)&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|455}}, the Spanish right wing planned their military ''coup d'état'' against the democratic Republic to reinstall [[monarchy]].&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;{{rp|17}} Finally, on 17 July 1936, a part of the Spanish Army, led by a group of [[far-right]]-wing officers (the generals [[José Sanjurjo]], [[Manuel Goded Llopis]], [[Emilio Mola]], [[Francisco Franco]], [[Miguel Cabanellas]], [[Gonzalo Queipo de Llano]], [[José Enrique Varela]], and others) launched a [[Spanish coup of July 1936|military ''coup d'état'' against the Spanish Republic in July 1936]].&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;{{rp|21}}&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|55}} The generals' ''coup d'état'' failed, but the rebellious army, known as the Nationalists, controlled a large part of Spain; the [[Spanish Civil War]] had started.

Franco, one of the leaders of the coup,&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1129487,00.html|title=Farewell To Franco|date=13 November 2005|magazine=TIME.com|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his Nationalist army, won the Spanish civil war in 1939. Franco ruled Spain for the next 36 years, until his death in 1975.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; Besides the mass assassinations of republican political enemies, [[political prisoner]]s were interned to [[Francoist concentration camps|concentration camp]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn.cat/virreinacentredelaimatge/english/02070719.htm|title=Portada – [La Virreina] Centre de la Imatge|publisher=|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[homosexual]]s were interned to psychiatric hospitals.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

== Red and White Terrors ==
From the beginning of the war, in July 1936, the ideological nature of the Nationalist fight against the Republicans indicated the degree of dehumanisation of the lower social classes (peasants and workers) in the view of the [[reactionary|politically-reactionary]] sponsors of the nationalist forces, the Roman Catholic Church of Spain, the aristocracy, the landowners, and the military, commanded by Franco. Captain [[Gonzalo de Aguilera Munro|Gonzalo de Aguilera y Munro]], a public affairs officer for the Nationalist forces, told the American reporter [[John Thompson Whitaker]]:&lt;ref name=Hochschild&gt;{{Cite book|title=Spain in Our Hearts|last=Hochschild|first=Adam|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2016|isbn=978-0-547-97318-0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/spaininourhearts0000hoch}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37}}

{{Quote| quote = You know what's wrong with Spain? Modern plumbing! In healthier times — spiritually healthier, you understand — plague and pestilence could be counted on to thin the Spanish masses ... now, with modern sewage disposal, they simply multiply too fast. The masses are no better than animals, you understand, and you can't expect them not to become infected with the virus of [[Bolshevism]]. After all, rats and lice carry the plague.&lt;ref name=Hochschild/&gt;{{rp|37}}}}

The Nationalists committed their atrocities in public, with assistance from the local Catholic Church clergy and from the upper social classes of the place (land and people) to be politically cleansed. In August 1936, the [[Massacre of Badajoz]] featured a great crowd of rich people and a Mass before the shooting of some 4,000 Republicans. Among the children of the landlords, the joke name ''Reforma agraria'' (agrarian reform) identified the horseback hunting parties by which they killed insubordinate peasantry and so cleansed their lands of communists; moreover, the joke name alluded to the grave where the corpses of the hunted peasants were dumped: the piece of land for which the dispossessed peasants had revolted.&lt;ref name=Hochschild/&gt;{{rp|37}} Early in the civil war most of the victims of the White Terror and the Red Terror were killed in mass executions behind the respective front lines of the Nationalist and of the Republican forces:

{{Quote| quote = During the first months of the fighting most of the deaths did not come from combat on the battlefield, but from political executions in — the "Red" and "White" terrors. In some cases, the murder of political opponents began more or less spontaneously, but, from the very beginning, there was always a certain degree of organization, and nearly all the killings, after the first few days, were carried out by organized groups.&lt;ref name=UCA&gt;[http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne26.htm Payne, Stanley G. ''A History of Spain and Portugal'' Vol. 2 Chapter 26 "The Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939" p. 649]&lt;/ref&gt;| source = }}
 
Common to the political purges of the left-wing and right-wing belligerents were the ''sacas'', the taking out of prisoners from the jails and the prisons, who then were taken for a ''paseo'', a ride to summary execution.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|233}} Most of the men and women taken out from the prisons and jails were killed by [[death squad]]s, from the trade unions, and by the [[paramilitary|paramilitary militia]]s of the political parties (the Republican CNT, UGT, and PCE; the Nationalist ''Falange'' and Carlist).&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|86}} Among the justifications for summary execution of right-wing enemies was reprisal for aerial bombings of civilians,&lt;ref name=Thomas/&gt;{{rp|268}} other people were killed after being denounced as an enemy of the people, by false accusations motivated by personal envy and hatred.&lt;ref name=Thomas/&gt;{{rp|264–5}} Nevertheless, the significant differences between White political terrorism and Red political terrorism was indicated by Francisco Partaloa, prosecutor of the [[Supreme Court of Spain|Supreme Court of Madrid]] (Tribunal Supremo de Madrid) and a friend of the aristocrat General Queipo de Llano, who witnessed the assassinations, first in the Republican camp and then in the Nationalist camp of the Spanish Civil War:

{{Quote| quote = I had the opportunity of being a witness to the repression in both areas. In the Nationalist side it was planned, methodical, cold. As they did not trust the [local] people, the authorities imposed their will by means of [[Terrorism|terror]], committing atrocities in order to achieve their aim. Atrocities also took place in the Popular Front zone; that was something which both areas had in common. But the main difference was that in the Republican zone the crimes were carried out by the [local] populace in moments of passion, not by the authorities. The latter always tried to stop them. The assistance that I received from the Spanish Republican authorities in order to flee to safety, is only one of the many examples. But this was not the case in the Nationalist zone.&lt;ref name="CH-sa"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0719-12432013000200002&amp;script=sci_arttext|title=Cuadernos de historia (Santiago) – LA REPRESIÓN: EL ADN DEL FRANQUISMO ESPAÑOL|journal=Cuadernos de Historia (Santiago)|issue=39|pages=33–59|accessdate=8 May 2015|doi=10.4067/S0719-12432013000200002|last1=Arnabat Mata|first1=Ramón|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;| source = }}

Historians of the Spanish Civil War, such as Helen Graham,&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;{{rp|30}} Paul Preston,&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|307}} Antony Beevor,&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|86-7}} Gabriel Jackson,&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Gabriel|title=The Spanish Republic and the Civil War, 1931–1939|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1967|isbn=0-691-00757-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|305}} Hugh Thomas, and Ian Gibson&lt;ref name=Gibson/&gt;{{rp|168}} concurred that the mass killings realized behind the Nationalist front lines were organized and approved by the Nationalist rebel authorities, while the killings behind the Republican front lines resulted from the societal breakdown of the Second Spanish Republic:

{{Quote| quote = Though there was much wanton killing in rebel Spain, the idea of the ''limpieza'', the "cleaning up" of the country from the evils which had overtaken it, was a disciplined policy of the new authorities, and a part of their programme of regeneration. In republican Spain, most of the killing was the consequence of anarchy, the outcome of a national breakdown, and not the work of the state; even though some political parties in some cities abetted the enormities, and even though some of those responsible ultimately rose to positions of authority.&lt;ref name=Thomas/&gt;{{rp|268}}}}

In the second volume of ''A History of Spain and Portugal'' (1973), [[Stanley Payne]] said that the political violence in the Republican zone was organized by the left-wing political parties:

{{Quote| quote = In general, this was not an irrepressible outpouring of hatred, by the man in the street for his "oppressors", as it has sometimes been painted, but a semi-organized activity carried out by sections of nearly all the leftist groups. In the entire leftist zone the only organized political party that eschewed involvement in such activity were the Basque Nationalists.&lt;ref name=UCA/&gt;}}

That, unlike the political repression by the [[right wing]], which "was concentrated against the most dangerous opposition elements", the Republican attacks were irrational, which featured the "murdering [of] innocent people, and letting some of the more dangerous go free. Moreover, one of the main targets of the Red terror was the clergy, most of whom were not engaged in overt opposition" to the Spanish Republic.&lt;ref name=UCA/&gt;{{rp|650}} Nonetheless, in a letter-to-the-editor of the ''ABC'' newspaper in Seville, [[Miguel de Unamuno]] said that, unlike the assassinations in the areas held by the Republic, the methodical assassinations effected by the White Terror were ordered by the highest authorities of the Nationalist rebellion, and identified General Mola as the proponent of the political cleansing policies of the White Terror.

{{Quote| quote = No matter how many the atrocities perpetrated by the Reds ... those perpetrated by the Whites are greater ... Murders without justification, such as two University lecturers, one in Valladolid, and another in Granada, just in case they were [[Masonic]], and [[García Lorca]] as well. It is disgusting to be a Spaniard stuck in Spain now. And all this is being directed by General Mola, that poisonous beast full of resentment. I told that Spain would be saved by Western Christian civilization, but the methods employed are not civilized, but militarized, not Western, but African, not Christian, but from an ancient Spanish traditionalism that is essentially anti-Christian.&lt;ref name=Redondo&gt;Miguel de Unamuno's letter to the ABC director in Seville in: Gonzalo Redondo, ''Historia de la Iglesia en España, 1931–1939: La Guerra Civil, 1936–1939'' p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When news of the mass killings of Republican soldiers and sympathizers — General Mola's policy to terrorise the Republicans — reached the Republican government, the Defence Minister [[Indalecio Prieto]] plead with the Spanish republicans:

{{Quote| quote = Don't imitate them! Don't imitate them! Surpass them in your moral conduct; surpass them by your generosity. I do not ask you, however, that you should lose vigour in battle or zeal in the fight. I ask for hard breasts for the combat, hard like steel, as some of the courageous militias have named themselves — Breast of Steel — but with sensitive hearts, capable of shaking in the face of human sorrow, and capable of harbouring mercy, the tender sentiment without which the most essential part of human greatness is lost.&lt;ref&gt;''¡No los imitéis! ¡No los imitéis! Superadlos en vuestra conducta moral; superadlos en vuestra generosidad. Yo no os pido, conste, que perdáis vigor en la lucha, ardor en la pelea. Pido pechos duros para el combate, duros, de acero, como se denominan algunas de las milicias valientes —pechos de acero— pero corazones sensibles, capaces de estremecerse ante el dolor humano y de ser albergue de la piedad, tierno sentimiento, sin el cual parece que se pierde lo más esencial de la grandeza humana."'' [[:es:q:Indalecio Prieto|Indalecio Prieto]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Moreover, despite his political loyalty to the reactionary rebellion of the Nationalists, the right-wing writer [[José María Pemán]] was concerned about the volume of the mass killings; in ''My Lunches with Important People'' (1970), he reported a conversation with General Miguel Cabanellas in late 1936:

{{Quote| quote = My General, I think that far too many people have been, and are still being killed, by the Nationalist side.&lt;br&gt; 
After a full minute of silent reflection, General Cabanellas grimly answered:&lt;br&gt;
—Yes.&lt;ref&gt;José María Pemán, ''Mis almuerzos con gente importante,'' 1970. p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;... thanks to the failure of the ''coup d'état'' and to the eruption of the Falangist and Carlist militias, with their previously prepared lists of victims, the scale on which these executions took place exceeded all precedent. Andalusia, where the supporters of Franco were a tiny minority, and where the military commander, General Queipo de Llano, was a pathological figure recalling the Conde de España of the [[First Carlist War]], was drenched in blood. The famous massacre of Badajoz was merely the culminating act of a ritual that had already been performed in every town and village in the South-West of Spain.

===Goals and victims of the repression===
The main goal of the White Terror was to terrify the civil population who opposed the coup,&lt;ref name=Thomas/&gt;{{rp|248}}&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|201}}&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;{{rp|34}} eliminate the supporters of the Republic and the militants of the leftist parties,&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;{{rp|29}}&lt;ref name=Morir/&gt;{{rp|84}}&lt;ref name=Southworth/&gt;{{rp|375}} and because of this, some historians have considered the White Terror a genocide.&lt;ref name=Serrano&gt;{{cite book|last=Serrano|first=Secundino|title=Maquis. Historia de una guerrilla antifranquista|publisher=Ediciones Temas de hoy|year=2001|isbn=978-8484601036}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24–8}}&lt;ref name=Moreno&gt;{{cite book|last=Moreno Gómez|first=Francisco|title=1936: el genocidio franquista en Córdoba|publisher=Editorial Crítica|year=2008|isbn=978-8474236866}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|501}} In fact, one of the leaders of the coup, General Mola said:&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|103}}

{{quote|It is necessary to spread terror. We have to create the impression of mastery eliminating without scruples or hesitation all those who do not think as we do. There can be no cowardice. If we hesitate one moment and fail to proceed with the greatest determination, we will not win. Anyone who helps or hides a Communist or a supporter of the Popular Front will be shot.}}

In areas controlled by the Nationalists, government officials, Popular Front politicians&lt;ref name=Thomas/&gt;{{rp|255}}&lt;ref name=Victimas/&gt;{{rp|99}} (in the city of Granada 23 of the 44 councillors of the city's corporation were executed),&lt;ref name=Gibson/&gt;{{rp|216-7}} union leaders, teachers&lt;ref name=Victimas/&gt;{{rp|95}} (in the first weeks of the war hundreds of teachers were killed by the Nationalists),&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|460}} intellectuals (for example, in Granada, between 26 July 1936 and 1 March 1939, the poet [[Federico García Lorca]], the editor of the left-wing newspaper ''[[El Defensor de Granada]]'', the professor of paediatrics in the Granada University, the rector of the university, the professor of political law, the professor of pharmacy, the professor of history, the engineer of the road to the top of the Sierra Morena and the best-known doctor in the city were killed by the Nationalists,&lt;ref name=Gibson/&gt;{{rp|110-1}}&lt;ref name=Thomas/&gt;{{rp|253}} and in the city of Cordoba, "nearly the entire republican elite, from deputies to booksellers, were executed in August, September and December..."),&lt;ref name=Thomas/&gt;{{rp|255}} suspected [[Suppression of Freemasonry|Freemasons]] (in Huesca, where there were only twelve Freemasons, the Nationalists killed a hundred suspected Freemasons),&lt;ref name=Victimas/&gt;{{rp|94}}&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|89}} [[Basque nationalism|Basque]],&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt;{{rp|377}} [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan]], [[Andalusian nationalism|Andalusian]] or [[Galicianism (Galicia)|Galician]] nationalists (among them [[Manuel Carrasco Formiguera|Manuel Carrasco i Formiguera]], leader of [[Democratic Union of Catalonia]] ''Unió Democrática de Catalunya'', [[Alexandre Boveda]], one of the founders of the ''[[Partido Galeguista (1931)|Partido Galeguista]]'' and [[Blas Infante]], leader of the Andalusian nationalism),&lt;ref name=Victimas/&gt;{{rp|229}} military officers who had remained loyal to the government of the Republic (among them the Army generals Domingo Batet,&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|66}} Enrique Salcedo Molinuevo, Miguel Campíns, Nicolás Molero,&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|66}} Nuñez de Prado, Manuel Romerales and Rogelio Caridad Pita),&lt;ref name=Serrano/&gt;{{rp|31}} and people suspected of voting for the Popular Front&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|123}} were targeted, usually brought before local committees and imprisoned or executed. The living conditions in the improvised Nationalist prisons were very harsh. One former Republican prisoner declared:&lt;ref name=Sender&gt;{{cite book|last=Sender Barayón|first=Ramon|title=A death in Zamora|publisher=Calm Unity Press|year=2003|isbn=1-58898-789-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|220–1}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;At times we were forty prisoners in a cell built to accommodate two people. There were two benches, each capable of seating three persons, and the floor to sleep on. For our private needs, there were only three chamberpots. They had to be emptied into an old rusty cauldron which also served for washing our clothes. We were forbidden to have food brought to us from outside, and were given disgusting soup cooked with soda ash which kept us in a constant state of dysentery. We were all in a deplorable state. The air was unbreathable and the babies choked many nights for lack of oxygen...
To be imprisoned, according to the rebels, was to lose all individuality. The most elementary human rights were unknown and people were killed as easily as rabbits...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because of this mass terror in many areas controlled by the Nationalists, thousands of Republicans left their homes and tried to hide in nearby forests or mountains.&lt;ref name=Serrano/&gt;{{rp|34}}&lt;ref name=Morir/&gt;{{rp|197}}&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|421}} Many of these ''huidos'' later joined the [[Spanish maquis]],&lt;ref name=Serrano/&gt;{{rp|75}} the anti-Francoist guerrilla force that continued to fight against the Francoist State in the post-war era. Hundreds of thousands of others fled to the areas controlled by the Second Republic. In 1938 there were more than one million refugees in Barcelona alone.&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|331}} In many cases, when someone fled the Nationalists executed their relatives. One witness in Zamora stated: "All the members of the Flechas family, both men and women, were killed, a total of seven persons. A son succeeded in escaping, but in his place they killed his eight-months-pregnant fiancé Transito Alonso and her mother, Juana Ramos."&lt;ref name=Sender/&gt;{{rp|232}} Furthermore, thousands of republicans joined ''Falange'' and the Nationalist army in order to escape the repression. In fact, many supporters of the Nationalists referred to the ''Falange'' as "our reds" and to the ''Falange'''s [[Blueshirts (Falange)|blue shirt]] as the ''salvavidas'' (life jacket).&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|224}}&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt;{{rp|308}} In Granada, one supporter of the Nationalists said:

{{quote|The battalion was formed to give political prisoners, who would otherwise have been shot, a chance either to redeem themselves on the field or else die with honour before enemy fire. In this way their children would not suffer the stigma of having had Red fathers.&lt;ref name=Gibson/&gt;{{rp|95-6}}}}

Another major target of the Terror were women, with the overall goal of keeping them in their traditional place in Spanish society. To this end the Nationalist army promoted a campaign of targeted rape. Quiepo de Llano spoke multiple times over the radio warning that "immodest" women with Republican sympathies would be raped by his Moorish troops. Near Seville, Nationalist soldiers raped a truckload of female prisoners, threw their bodies down a well, and paraded around town with their rifles draped with their victim's underwear. These rapes were not the result of soldiers disobeying orders, but official Nationalist policies, with officers specifically choosing Moors to be the primary perpetrators. Advancing nationalist troops scrawled "Your children will give birth to fascists" on the walls of captured buildings, and many women taken prisoner were force fed [[castor oil]], then paraded in public naked, while the powerful [[laxative]] did its work.&lt;ref name=Hochschild/&gt;{{rp|38-9}}

Estimates of executions behind the Nationalist lines during the Spanish Civil War range from fewer than 50,000&lt;ref name=UCA/&gt; to 200,000&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt;{{rp|539}} (Hugh Thomas: 75,000,&lt;ref name=Thomas/&gt;{{rp|900}} Secundino Serrano: 90,000;&lt;ref name=Serrano/&gt;{{rp|32}} Josep Fontana: 150,000;&lt;ref name=Fontana/&gt;{{rp|23}} and Julián Casanova: 100,000.&lt;ref name="Casanova, Julian 2010. p.181"&gt;Casanova, Julián.

Many of the executions in the course of the war were carried by militants of the fascist party ''Falange''&lt;ref name=Espinosa/&gt;{{rp|175}} (''[[Falange Española de las J.O.N.S.]]'') or militants of the [[Carlism|Carlist]] party (''[[Traditionalist Communion|Comunión Tradicionalista]]'') militia (''[[Requetés]]''), but with the approval of the Nationalist government.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|201-2}}

===Cooperation of the Spanish Church===
The Spanish Church approved of the White Terror and cooperated with the rebels.&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|88}}&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;{{rp|82-3}}&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt;{{rp|306-7}}&lt;ref name=Morir/&gt;{{rp|47}} According to Antony Beevor: "Cardinal [[Isidro Goma y Tomas|Gomá]] stated that 'Jews and Masons poisoned the national soul with absurd doctrine'... A few brave priests put their lives at risk by criticizing nationalist atrocities, but the majority of the clergy in nationalist areas revelled in their new-found power and the increased size of their congregations. Anyone who did not attend Mass faithfully was likely to be suspected of 'red' tendencies. Entrepreneurs made a great money selling religious symbols... It was reminiscent of the way the Inquisition's persecutions of Jews and Moors helped make pork such an important part of the Spanish diet."&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|96}} One witness in Zamora said: "Many priests acted very badly. The bishop of Zamora in 1936 was more or less an assassin—I don't remember his name. He must be held responsible because prisoners appealed to him to save their lives. All he would reply was that the Reds had killed more people than the falangist were killing."&lt;ref name=Sender/&gt;{{rp|233}} (The bishop of Zamora in 1936 was [[Manuel Arce y Ochotorena]])&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Nationalists killed at least 16 Basque nationalist priests (among them the arch-priest of Mondragon),&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|82-3}} and imprisoned or deported hundreds more.&lt;ref name=Thomas/&gt;{{rp|677}} Several priests who tried to halt the killings&lt;ref name=Thomas/&gt;{{rp|251-2}} and at least one priest who was a Mason were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasonrytoday.com/29/p10.php|title=Freemasonry and the Spanish Civil War: Part I, the Path to War|access-date=2009-08-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828085718/http://www.freemasonrytoday.com/29/p10.php|archive-date=2010-08-28|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the callous attitude of the [[Holy See|Vatican]], [[Manuel Montero]], lecturer of the [[University of the Basque Country]] commented on 6 May 2007:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almendron.com/tribuna/?p=15373 Manuel Montero a ''El País'', 6/5/2007, «Otros "mártires" de la Guerra Civil»]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Church, which upheld the idea of a 'National [[Crusade]]' in order to legitimize the military rebellion, was a [[belligerent]] part during the Civil War, even at the cost of alienating part of its members. It continues in a belligerent role in its unusual answer to the [[Historical Memory Law]] by recurring to the beatification of 498 "martyrs" of the Civil War. The priests executed by Franco's Army are not counted among them. It continues to be a Church that is incapable of transcending its one-sided behaviour of 70 years ago and amenable to the fact that this past should always haunt us. In this political use of granting religious recognition one can perceive its indignation regarding the compensations to the victims of Francoism. Its selective criteria regarding the religious persons that were part of its ranks are difficult to fathom. The priests who were victims of the republicans are "martyrs who died forgiving", but those priests who were executed by the Francoists are forgotten.}}

== Postwar ==
When [[Heinrich Himmler]] visited Spain in 1940, a year after Franco's victory, he claimed to have been 
"shocked" by the brutality of the Falangist repression.&lt;ref name="newyorker"&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/10/31/051031crbo_books?currentPage=all Packer, George "The Spanish Prisoner" ''The New Yorker'' October 31, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1939, the foreign minister of [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]], [[Galeazzo Ciano]], reported of "trials going on every day at a speed which I would call almost summary... There are still a great number of shootings. In Madrid alone, between 200 and 250 a day, in Barcelona 150, in Seville 80".&lt;ref name=Thomas/&gt;{{rp|898}} While authors like Payne have cast doubts on the democratic leanings of the Republic, "fascism was clearly on the other".&lt;ref name="newyorker" /&gt;

===Repressive laws===
According to Beevor, Spain was an open prison for all those who opposed Franco.&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|407}} Until 1963, all the opponents of the Francoist State were brought before military courts.&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;{{rp|134}} A number of repressive laws were issued, including the [[Law of Political Responsibilities]] (''Ley de Responsabilidades Políticas'') in February 1939, the Law of Security of State (''Ley de Seguridad del Estado'') in 1941 (which regarded illegal propaganda or labour strikes as military rebellion), the Law for the Repression of Masonry and Communism (''Ley de Represión de la Masonería y el Comunismo'') on 2 March 1940,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revistes.iec.cat/revistes/index.php/CHR/article/viewFile/639/CHR108_133|title=The francoist repression in the Catalan countries.

Political parties and trade unions were forbidden except for the government party, Traditionalist Spanish Falange and Offensive of the Unions of the National-Syndicalist (''[[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista]]'' or FET de las JONS), and the official trade union [[Spanish Trade Union Organisation]] (''Sindicato Vertical''). Hundreds of militants and supporters of the parties and trade unions declared illegal under Francoist Spain, such as the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (''Partido Socialista Obrero Español''), PSOE; the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] (''Partido Comunista de España''), PCE; the [[Workers' General Union]] (''Unión General de Trabajadores''), UGT; and the [[National Confederation of Labor]] (''Confederación Nacional del Trabajo''), CNT, were imprisoned or executed.&lt;ref name=Victimas/&gt;{{rp|395-405}} The [[language politics in Spain under Franco|regional languages]], like [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]], were also forbidden,&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|225}} and the statutes of autonomy of [[Catalonia]]&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|341}} and the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque country]] were abolished. Censorship of the press (the Law of Press, passed in April 1938)&lt;ref name=Thomas/&gt;{{rp|740}} and of cultural life was rigorously exercised and forbidden books destroyed.&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|408}}

===Executions, forced labour and medical experiments===
{{main|Victims of the White Terror (Spain)}}
At the end of the Spanish Civil War the executions of the "enemies of the state" continued (some 50,000 people were killed),&lt;ref name=Morir/&gt;{{rp|8}}&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|405}} including the extrajudicial (death squad) executions of members of the Spanish maquis (anti–Francoist guerrillas) and their supporters (''los enlaces'', "the links");in the province of Córdoba 220 ''maquis'' and 160 ''enlaces'' were killed.&lt;ref name=Serrano/&gt;{{rp|}}&lt;ref name=Moreno/&gt;{{rp|585}} Thousands of men and women were imprisoned after the civil war in [[Francoist concentration camps]], approximately 367,000 to 500,000 prisoners were held in 50 camps or prisons.&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|404}} In 1933, before the war, the prisons of Spain contained some 12,000 prisoners,&lt;ref&gt;Tusell, Javier. ''La dictadura de Franco''. Ediciones Altaya. Madrid. 1996. p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; just seven years later, in 1940, just one year after the end of the civil war, 280,000 prisoners were held in more than 500 prisons throughout the country.&lt;ref name=Victimas/&gt;{{rp|288-91}} The principal purpose of the Francoist concentration camps was to classify the prisoners of war from the defeated Spanish Republic; men and women who were classified as "unrecoverable", were put to death.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|308}}

After the war, the republican prisoners were sent to work in militarised penal colonies (''Colonias Penales Militarizadas''), penal detachments (''Destacamentos Penales'') and disciplinary battalions of worker-soldiers (''Batallones Disciplinarios de Soldados Trabajadores'').&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|309}} According to Beevor, 90,000 Republican prisoners were sent off to 121 labour battalions and 8,000 to military workshops.&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|404}} In 1939, Ciano said about the Republican prisoners of war: "They are not prisoners of war, they are slaves of war".&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|317}} Thousands of prisoners (15,947 in 1943)&lt;ref name=Morir/&gt;{{rp|24-6}} were forced to work building dams, highways, the Guadalquivir Canal&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|313}} (10,000 political prisoners worked on its construction between 1940 and 1962),&lt;ref name=Moreno/&gt;{{rp|17}} the [[Carabanchel Prison]], the Valley of the Fallen (''[[Valle de los Caídos]]'') (20,000 political prisoners worked in its construction)&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|313}}&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;{{rp|131}} and in coal mines in Asturias and Leon.&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|405}} The severe overcrowding of the prisons (according to [[Antony Beevor]] 270,000 prisoners were spread around jails with capacity for 20,000),&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|405}} poor sanitary conditions and the lack of food caused thousands of deaths (4,663 prisoner deaths were recorded between 1939 and 1945 in 13 of the 50 Spanish provinces),&lt;ref name=Morir/&gt;{{rp|20}} among them the poet [[Miguel Hernández]]&lt;ref name=Victimas/&gt;{{rp|292}} and the politician [[Julián Besteiro]].&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|319}} New investigations suggest that the actual number of dead prisoners was much higher, with around 15,000 deaths just in 1941 (the worst year).&lt;ref&gt;Gómez, F.

Just as with the death toll from executions by the Nationalists during the Civil War, historians have made different estimations the victims of the White Terror after the war. Stanley Payne estimates 30,000 executions following the end of the war.&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt;{{rp|110}} Recent searches conducted with parallel excavations of mass graves in Spain (in particular by the [[Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory]], ARMH) estimate that the total of people executed after the war arrive at a number between 15,000 and 35,000.&lt;ref name=ARMH&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/cronica/2002/351/1026114970.html Fosas Comunes – Los desaparecidos de Franco.

[[Julián Casanova Ruiz]], nominated in 2008 among the experts in the first judicial investigation (conducted by judge [[Baltasar Garzón]]) against the Francoist crimes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Aportaremos/trozos/verdad/puzzle/resolvera/Garzon/elpepiesp/20081023elpepinac_11/Tes "Aportaremos trozos de verdad a un 'puzzle' que resolverá Garzón"], ''[[El País]]'', 23 de octubre de 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; estimate 50,000.&lt;ref name=Morir/&gt;{{rp|8}} Historian [[Josep Fontana]] says 25,000.&lt;ref name=Fontana/&gt;{{rp|22}} According to Gabriel Jackson, the number of victims of the White Terror (executions and hunger or illness in prisons) just between 1939 and 1943 was 200,000.&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt;{{rp|539}}

A Francoist psychiatrist, [[Antonio Vallejo-Nájera]], carried out medical experiments on prisoners in the Francoist concentration camps to "establish the bio-psych roots of Marxism".&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|407}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologyinspain.com/content/full/1997/1frame.htm "Psychology in Francoist Concentration Camps" (1997) in ''Psychology in Spain'', published by the Spanish College of Psychologists]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|310}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/01/spain.gilestremlett|title=Spain under Franco: 'Marxists are retards'|author=Giles Tremlett|newspaper=the Guardian|accessdate=8 May 2015|date=November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vallejo Najera also said that it was necessary to remove the children of the Republican women from their mothers. Thousands of children were taken from their mothers and handed over to Francoist families (in 1943 12,043).&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|407}} Many of the mothers were executed afterwards.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|314}}&lt;ref name=Sender/&gt;{{rp|224}} "For mothers who had a baby with them—and there were many—the first sign that they were to be executed was when their infant was snatched from them. Everyone knew what this meant. A mother whose little one was taken had only a few hours left to live".

Stanley Payne observes that Franco's repression did not undergo "cumulative radicalisation" like that of Hitler; in fact, the opposite occurred, with major persecution being slowly reduced. 95% of death sentences under Franco's rule occurred by 1941. During the next thirty months, military prosecutors sought 939 death sentences, most of which were not approved and others commuted. On October 1 1939, all former Republican personnel serving a sentence of less than six years were pardoned. In 1940 special military judicial commissions were created to examine sentences and were given the power to confirm or reduce them but never to extend them. Later that year, provisional liberty was granted to all political prisoners serving less than six years and in April 1941, this was also granted to those serving less than twelve years and then fourteen years in October. Provisional liberty was extended to those serving up to twenty years in December 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Stanley G., and Jesús Palacios. Franco: A personal and political biography. University of Wisconsin Pres, 2014, p.210-211&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fate of Republican exiles===
Furthermore, hundreds of thousands were forced into exile (470,000 in 1939),&lt;ref name=Victimas/&gt;{{rp|283}} with many intellectuals and artists who had supported the Republic&lt;ref name="hispanicexile.bham.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hispanicexile.bham.ac.uk/|title=Homepage – Exile Remains|website=www.hispanicexile.bham.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Antonio Machado]], [[Ramon J.

When Nazi Germany occupied [[German occupation of France during World War II|France]], Franco's politicians encouraged the Germans to detain and to deport thousands of Republican refugees to the concentration camps.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|315}} 15,000 Spanish Republicans were deported to [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Buchenwald]] (including the writer [[Jorge Semprún]]),&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|492}} [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]], [[Sachsenhausen-Oranienburg]] (among them the politician [[Francisco Largo Caballero]]),&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|413}} [[Auschwitz]], [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenburg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrightsblog.org/2008/06/|title=The Human Rights Blog|access-date=2009-03-23|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120903180600/http://www.humanrightsblog.org/2008/06/|archive-date=2012-09-03|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]] (5,000 out of 7,200 Spanish prisoners at Mauthausen died there).&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|419}} Other Spanish Republicans were detained by the [[Gestapo]], handed over to Spain and executed, among them [[Julián Zugazagoitia]], [[Juan Peiró]], Francisco Cruz Salido and [[Lluis Companys]] (president of the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]])&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|412}} and another 15,000 were forced to work building the [[Atlantic Wall]].&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|}} Moreover, 4,000 Spanish Republicans were deported by the Nazis to the occupied [[Occupation of the Channel Islands|Channel Islands]] and were [[Lager Sylt|forced to work]] building fortifications; only 59 survived.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|314-5}} Thus, thousands of Spanish refugees (10,000 fighters in 1944) joined the [[French Resistance]]&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;{{rp|125}}—among them [[Coronel Carlos Romero Giménez|Colonel Carlos Romero Giménez]]—and the [[2nd Armored Division (France)|Free French Forces]].&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|419}}

===Purges and labour discrimination===
[[File:Nafarroako irakasleak 1936 1.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque in [[Pamplona]] with the list of teachers murdered and cracked down by the Spanish Nationalists, 1936 and later]]
The Francoist State carried out extensive purges among the civil service. Thousands of officials loyal to the Republic were expelled from the army.&lt;ref&gt;Tusell, Javier. ''La dictadura de Franco.'' Ediciones Altaya. Madrid. 1996. p.174&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of university and school teachers lost their jobs (a quarter of all Spanish teachers).&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;{{rp|132}}&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|408}} Priority for employment was always given to Nationalist supporters, and it was necessary to have a "good behavior" certificate from local Falangist officials and parish priests.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|312}} Furthermore, the Francoist State encouraged tens of thousands of Spaniards to denounce their Republican neighbours and friends:&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;{{rp|134-5}}&lt;ref name=Beevor/&gt;{{rp|408-9}}&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|311}}

{{quote|Although this process has not been analysed in detail, the regime did all it could to encourage denunciation. The Code of Military Justice that regulated the entire trial process effectively created a denouncer's charter and allowed prosecutions to begin through 'any denunciation worthy of consideration'. Denunciations did not even have to be signed before 1941. The radical nature of this rule outflanked even the Nazis' efforts to root out those they despised, indeed they took measures to restrict 'self-interested' denunciations. The Franco regime also went to greater lengths to encourage denunciations. Following the occupation of a village or town the new authorities set up special denunciation centres and placed announcements in newspapers and government publications exhorting people to denounce Republicans. Francoists even made it an offence not to register denunciations against Republicans known to have committed crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Peter|title=Singling Out Victims: Denunciation and Collusion|journal=[[European History Quarterly]]|date=January 2009|volume=39|issue=1|pages=16|doi=10.1177/0265691408097364}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Campaign against Republican women===
Republican women were also victims of the repression in postwar Spain. Thousands of women suffered public humiliation (being paraded naked through the streets, being shaved and forced to ingest castor oil so they would soil themselves in public),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Michael|title=A Time of Silence: Civil War and the Culture of Repression in Franco's Spain, 1936–1945|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|isbn=9780521594011|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; sexual harassment and rape.&lt;ref name=Paul/&gt;{{rp|413}} In many cases, the houses and goods of the widows of Republicans were confiscated by the government.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|307}} Thus, many Republican women, living in total poverty, were forced into prostitution.&lt;ref name=Paul/&gt;{{rp|266}} According to Paul Preston: "The increase in prostitution both benefited Francoist men who thereby slaked their lust and also reassured them that 'red' women were a fount of dirt and corruption".&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|308}} Furthermore, thousands of women were executed (for example [[Las Trece Rosas|''the 13 roses'']]) among them pregnant women. One judge said: "We cannot wait seven months to execute a woman".&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|}}

Furthermore, under the Francoist legislation, a woman needed her husband's permission to take a job or open a bank account. Adultery by women was a crime, but adultery by the husband was a crime only if he lived with his mistress.&lt;ref name=Tremlett&gt;{{cite book|last=Tremlett|first=Giles|title=Ghosts of Spain: Travels through Spain and its silent past|publisher=Faber and Faber Ltd|year=2006|isbn=9780802715746|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ghostsofspaintra00trem}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|211}}

===Marriage law===
The divorce and marriage legislation of the Republic was retroactively reversed, with the divorces retroactively unmade and the children of civil marriages made [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]].&lt;ref name=Graham/&gt;{{rp|134}}

===Homosexuals===
Homosexuals were first sent to concentration camps. Then the 1954 reform of the 1933 "Ley de vagos y maleantes" ("Vagrancy Act") declared homosexuality illegal. Around 5,000 homosexuals were arrested during Francoism due to their sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;ORTIZ HERAS, M. (2013).

Editorial Bomarzo. Page 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The last concentration camp, at [[Miranda de Ebro]], was closed in 1947.&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|309}} By the early 1950s the parties and trade unions made illegal by the Francoist State had been decimated by the Francoist police, and the Spanish maquis had ceased to exist as an organized resistance.&lt;ref name=Victimas/&gt;{{rp|388}} Nevertheless, new forms of opposition started like the unrest in the universities and strikes in Barcelona, Madrid and Vizcaya. The 1960s saw the start of the labour strikes led by the illegal union trade [[Workers' Commissions]] (''Comisiones Obreras''), linked to the Communist Party and the protest in the universities continued to grow. Finally, with Franco's death in 1975, the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] commenced and in 1978 the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] was approved.

After Franco's death, the Spanish government approved the [[Spanish 1977 Amnesty Law]] (''Ley de Amnistia de 1977'') which granted a pardon for all political crimes committed by the supporters of the Francoist State (including the White Terror)&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;{{rp|324}} and by the democratic opposition. Nevertheless, in October 2008 a Spanish judge, [[Baltasar Garzón]], of the [[National Court of Spain]] authorized, for the first time, an investigation into the disappearance and assassination of 114,000 victims of the Francoist State between 1936 and 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1851334,00.html?xid=feed-cnn-world "At Last, Spain Faces Up to Franco's Guilt" ''TIME'']&lt;/ref&gt; This investigation proceeded on the basis of the notion that this mass-murder constituted a [[crime against humanity]] which cannot be subject to any amnesty or statute of limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2008/10/17/espana/1224194401_850215.html|title=Garzón atribuye a Franco un plan de exterminio sistemático de los 'rojos'|author=Ediciones El País|work=EL PAÍS|accessdate=8 May 2015|date=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in May 2010, Mr. Garzón was accused of violating the terms of the general amnesty and his powers as a jurist have been suspended pending further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/14/garzon-suspended-franco-investigation | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Giles | last=Tremlett | title=Judge Baltasar Garzón suspended over Franco investigation | date=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, the Argentine justice reopened a probe into crimes committed during the Spanish Civil War and during Franco's reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11189926 | work=BBC News | title=Argentine court reopens Franco probe | date=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/03/19/spain-end-amnesty-franco-era-atrocities|title=Spain: End Amnesty for Franco Era Atrocities – Human Rights Watch|publisher=|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Council of Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc05/EDOC10737.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305051442/http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc05/EDOC10737.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-05 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[United Nations]] have asked the Spanish government to investigate the crimes of Franco's reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/spain-no-global-exception-when-investigating-crimes-past-20081113|title="No Global Exception When Investigating Crimes Past" Amnesty International|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
