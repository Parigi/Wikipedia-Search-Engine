== History ==
Details regarding the smartphone were leaked widely starting several months before the official release, with complete specifications, renderings, and real-life images of the phone being publicized, many of which turned out to be correct, such as advancements in the camera and the continuation of the 'notch' design from the frontal camera featured since the [[iPhone X]].&lt;ref name="TechRadar" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/iphone-11-pro-apple-release-date-details-features-rumours-latest-update-a9074481.html|title=Apple is about to launch a huge range of new products – here's what they are|last1=Griffin|first1=Andrew|date=22 August 2019|work=The Independent|accessdate=27 August 2019|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whathifi.com/advice/iphone-11-release-date-price-specs-and-latest-news-for-the-new-iphones|title=iPhone 11: release date, price and leaks for the new iPhone|website=WhatHiFi|language=en|accessdate=27 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some leaks turned out to be incorrect, such as the inclusion of bilateral charging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2019/09/23/iphone-11-teardown/|title=iPhone 11 teardown reveals lack of bilateral wireless charging evidence, same logic board as Pro models, more|last=Potuck|first=Michael|date=2019-09-23|website=9to5Mac|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/iphone-11-rumor-roundup-what-you-need-to-know|title=iPhone 11 Rumor Roundup: What You Need to Know|website=PCMAG|language=en|access-date=2020-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official release event invites sent out to press featured layered colored glass elements organized to form the Apple logo, which some reviewers drew similarities to Apple's original logo, suggesting new colors for the phone, and to a patent Apple filed for a new camera design earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/iphone-11-launch-date-confirmed-19163964|title=iPhone 11 launch date confirmed as Apple sends out invitation to 'special event'|last=Curtis|first=Sophie|date=2019-09-02|website=mirror|access-date=2019-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/58961-iphone-11-apple-event-invite-may-hint-at-the-future-of-smartphone-cameras|title=iPhone 11: Apple Event Invite May Hint at the Future of Smartphone Cameras|last=Brown|first=Mike|website=Inverse|language=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scan of back of iPhone 11 Pro Max Space Grey.jpg|thumb|top|upright|The back side of the iPhone 11 Pro Max in Space Grey.]]
The iPhone 11 Pro is available in Gold, Silver, Space Gray, and Midnight Green, a new color previously not available on iPhones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone-11-pro/specs/|title=iPhone 11 Pro – Technical Specifications – Apple|access-date=2019-09-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190914011954/https://www.apple.com/iphone-11-pro/specs/|archive-date=2019-09-14|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the iPhone XS, there is a display cutout at the front that includes the 12 MP [[TrueDepth]] camera system and speaker. There is also a new rear camera design with three lenses and a flash in a larger, square-shaped bump, which is the most visible difference compared to the iPhone XS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/apple/149318-iphone-11-colors-colours-pro|title=iPhone 11 colors: All the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro colors available|last=Pocket-lint|date=2019-09-11|website=Pocket-lint|language=en|access-date=2019-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190911024528/https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/apple/149318-iphone-11-colors-colours-pro|archive-date=2019-09-11|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone-11-pro/specs/|title=iPhone 11 Pro – Technical Specifications|website=[[Apple Inc.]]|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190910184851/https://www.apple.com/iphone-11-pro/specs/|archive-date=2019-09-10|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple logo is now centered on the back of the device with no text, and the glass has a frosted matte finish, unlike the glossy finish found on other glass-backed iPhones.

====Camera====

The iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max both include a triple-lens 12 MP rear camera array. There is one ƒ/2.4 ultra wide angle lens with a 120 degree field of view and 2x optical zoom out, one ƒ/1.8 wide angle lens, and one ƒ/2.0 telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom in. There is a burst mode, image stabilization, [[High dynamic range|HDR]] and a portrait mode with supporting an advanced bokeh effect. The phones support a Portrait Mode supporting depth control and an advanced [[bokeh]] effect. The phone also has an automatic Night Mode allowing the camera to take brighter pictures with reduced noise in low light environments. There is also a redesigned camera app that adds new features such as a scroll wheel for choosing between the different lenses and long-pressing the shutter button to take a video. Apple has also announced a new Deep Fusion feature which will take advantage of AI and machine learning for image processing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11-pro/|title=iPhone 11 Pro Roundup|website=[[Macrumors]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190911214845/https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-11-pro/|archive-date=2019-09-11|access-date=2019-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iPhone 11 Pro supports [[4K resolution|4K video]] up to 60 fps and 1080p slow motion at up to 240 fps.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, Apple limits the full range of zoom (0.5x -6x) while shooting in 4K @ 60fps to either 0.5x - 1.5x or 1x to 2x depending which lens is selected upon recording. All other resolutions/frame rates support the full zoom set. The phone also features an audio zoom feature which focuses audio on the area that is being zoomed in on.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; All of the cameras support video although only the wide and telephoto come with [[Image stabilization#Optical image stabilization|optical image stabilization]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Video can be captured with multiple cameras at the same time, through the multi camera recording feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ubergizmo.com/2019/09/iphone-11-pro-multi-camera-come-to-older-iphones/|title=iPhone 11 Pro's Multi-Camera Video Recording Feature Will Be Coming To Older iPhones|last=PDT|first=Tyler Lee on 09/16/2019 17:09|website=Ubergizmo|language=en|access-date=2019-09-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190919134001/https://www.ubergizmo.com/2019/09/iphone-11-pro-multi-camera-come-to-older-iphones/|archive-date=2019-09-19|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both models also have a 12 MP TrueDepth front camera with a ƒ/2.0 aperture. The front camera also supports stabilized 4K video recording up to 60fps.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Apple has added slow motion video recording to the front camera in 1080p at up to 120 fps, a feature which Apple refers to as "slofies". Similar to previous iPhone models, the TrueDepth system is also used for Face ID and Animoji.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Software===
{{See also|iOS 13|iOS version history}}

==Reception==
Upon release, the iPhone 11 Pro received generally positive reviews, with critics highlighting the improvements to the camera, display, and battery, although it was criticized for its similar design to the iPhone XS and the large camera bump, as well as the lack of rumored features such as bilateral wireless charging and USB-C. [[TechRadar]] critics praised the improved camera array, calling it "clearly the big upgrade", and also praised the faster [[Apple A13|A13 Bionic]] processor, and the display, while criticizing the design similarities compared to the [[iPhone XS]] including display cut-out for the sensor housing, commonly referred to as "the notch," and also criticizing the cost.&lt;ref name="TechRadar"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techradar.com/reviews/hands-on-iphone-11-max-review|title=Hands on: Hands on: iPhone 11 Pro Max review|last=Beavis|first=Gareth |website=[[TechRadar]]|language=en|access-date=2019-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190911215147/https://www.techradar.com/reviews/hands-on-iphone-11-max-review|archive-date=2019-09-11|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-11-pro|title=iPhone 11 Pro Hands-on Review|last=Phones|first=Mark Spoonauer 2019-09-11T13:24:44Z|website=Tom's Guide|language=en|access-date=2019-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190911022037/https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-11-pro|archive-date=2019-09-11|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pocket Lint also positively described the camera, the processor, display, and battery, camera design, and lack of bilateral wireless charging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/reviews/apple/149324-apple-iphone-11-pro-max-review|title=Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max initial review|last=Pocket-lint|date=2019-09-11|website=Pocket-lint|language=en|access-date=2019-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190911024912/https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/reviews/apple/149324-apple-iphone-11-pro-max-review|archive-date=2019-09-11|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/reviews/apple/149323-iphone-11-pro-review|title=Apple iPhone 11 Pro initial review|last=Pocket-lint|date=2019-09-11|website=Pocket-lint|language=en|access-date=2019-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190911025010/https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/reviews/apple/149323-iphone-11-pro-review|archive-date=2019-09-11|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Verge]] and [[T3 (magazine)|T3]] positively described the general aspects of the phone, while stating that the 'pro' label may not be fully justified as the phone only helps Apple keep up with the competitors, not surpass them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20857971/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-hands-on-features-photos-video-camera-price|title=iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max: hands-on with Apple's new flagship phones|last=Bohn|first=Dieter|date=2019-09-10|website=[[The Verge]]|access-date=2019-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190911072053/https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20857971/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-hands-on-features-photos-video-camera-price|archive-date=2019-09-11|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.t3.com/news/iphone-11-pro-review-early-verdict-apple-tries-to-go-pro-with-a-triple-lens-camera|title=iPhone 11 Pro review (early verdict): Apple tries to go pro with a triple-lens camera|last=Jones 2019-09-11T10:13:57Z|first=Robert|website=[[T3 (magazine)|T3]]|language=en|access-date=2019-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190912222739/https://www.t3.com/news/iphone-11-pro-review-early-verdict-apple-tries-to-go-pro-with-a-triple-lens-camera|archive-date=2019-09-12|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon Footprint===
[[File:IPhone 11 Pro Carbon Footprint.jpg|thumb|Carbon Footprint of an iPhone 11 Pro in KG CO2]]
The iPhone 11 Pro has a carbon footprint of 80&amp;nbsp;kg CO2e emissions which is 2&amp;nbsp;kg more than the preceding iPhone XS and 25&amp;nbsp;kg more than the iPhone 3G in 2008. 83% of the emissions are caused by the production of the device and primary resources while remaining emissions are caused by transportation and first use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | author-link =Apple Inc.| title = Environmental Report iPhone 3G (2008)| publisher = Apple Inc.| url = https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/products/archive/2009/iPhone-3G-Environmental-Report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | author-link =Apple Inc. | title = Environmental Report iPhone 11 Pro (2019)| publisher = Apple Inc. | url = https://www.apple.com/br/environment/pdf/products/iphone/iPhone_11_Pro_PER_sept2019.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Repairability===
The iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max continues the strategy of discouraging customers to seek 3rd party repairs while rendering repairs with Apple more costly: repair with non authentic parts such as batteries or displays can trigger warning messages on the phone instigating the customer to visit a certified technician to replace the respective parts with genuine ones. While the website clearly states that the phone will function properly despite the warning, this information is not passed in the context of the warning. Even if batteries are properly functioning and at full capacity the customers are prompted by a message on the phone to replace the battery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple Is Locking iPhone Batteries to Discourage Repair |url=https://www.ifixit.com/News/32343/apple-is-locking-batteries-to-iphones-now |website=I Fix It |publisher=I Fix It |accessdate=2 June 2020 |date=7 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time battery replacement with original spareparts saw a hike in pricing: after initially discounting battery replacements to $29 following the [[Batterygate|Battery Gate Scandal]], battery replacement prices for all flagship iPhone models hiked to 69.00US$.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=iPhone Battery Replacement Costs |url=https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/service/battery-power |website=apple.com |publisher=Apple Inc. |accessdate=2 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
