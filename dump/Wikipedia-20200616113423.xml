'''Rock Hudson''' (born '''Roy Harold Scherer Jr.'''; November 17, 1925 – October 2, 1985) was an American actor. One of the most popular movie stars of his time, Hudson's screen career spanned four decades. A prominent heartthrob of the [[Hollywood Golden Age]], he achieved stardom with his role in ''[[Magnificent Obsession (1954 film)|Magnificent Obsession]]'' (1954),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/82395/Magnificent-Obsession/articles.html|title=Magnificent Obsession (1954) - Articles - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies|access-date=October 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by ''[[All That Heaven Allows]]'' (1955) and ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), for which he received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. Hudson also found continued success with a string of romantic comedies co-starring [[Doris Day]]: ''[[Pillow Talk (film)|Pillow Talk]]'' (1959), ''[[Lover Come Back (1961 film)|Lover Come Back]]'' (1961), and ''[[Send Me No Flowers]]'' (1964). During the late 1960s, his films included ''[[Seconds (1966 film)|Seconds]]'' (1966), ''[[Tobruk (1967 film)|Tobruk]]'' (1967), and ''[[Ice Station Zebra]]'' (1968).  Unhappy with the film scripts he was offered,&lt;ref name="Overview for Rock Hudson"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/90260%7C133734/Rock-Hudson/|title=Overview for Rock Hudson|website=Turner Classic Movies|access-date=October 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hudson turned to television and was a hit, starring in the popular mystery series ''[[McMillan &amp; Wife]]'' (1971–1977). His last role was as a guest star on the fifth season (1984–1985) of the primetime ABC soap opera ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]],'' until the ravages of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS-related illness]] made it impossible for him to continue.&lt;ref name="Overview for Rock Hudson"/&gt;

Numerous film magazines declared Hudson Star of the Year, Favorite Leading Man, and similar titles. He appeared in nearly 70 films and starred in several television productions during a career that spanned more than four decades. 

Although he was discreet regarding his sexual orientation, it was known by many in the film industry during his lifetime that he was gay. In 1984, Hudson was diagnosed with AIDS. The following year, he became one of the first celebrities to disclose both his homosexuality and AIDS diagnosis. Hudson was the first major celebrity to die from an AIDS-related illness, on October 2, 1985, at age 59, in Beverly Hills, California.&lt;ref name="tcmdb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcmdb.com/participant.jsp?participantId=90260%7c133734&amp;afiPersonalNameId=null |title=Biography for Rock Hudson |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] Database. tcmdb.com |accessdate=December 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330041810/http://www.tcmdb.com/participant.jsp?participantId=90260%7C133734&amp;afiPersonalNameId=null |archivedate=March 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hudson was born '''Roy Harold Scherer Jr.''' on November 17, 1925 in [[Winnetka, Illinois|Winnetka]], Illinois, the only child of Katherine (''née'' Wood), a homemaker and later [[Switchboard operator|telephone operator]], and Roy Harold Scherer Sr., an [[auto mechanic]].&lt;ref name="Royce"&gt;Royce, Brenda Scott (2003). "Rock Hudson", in William L. O'Neill and [[Kenneth T. Jackson]] (eds.), ''The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives: The 1960s''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. Retrieved via ''Biography in Context'' database, November 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was of German and Swiss descent, while his mother had English and Irish ancestry. He was raised as a Roman Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Long Goodbye: Rock Hudson, 1925–85|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20091996,00.html|website=people.com|access-date=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Great Depression]], Hudson's father lost his job and abandoned the family.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt; Hudson's parents divorced when he was four years old; a few years later, in 1932, his mother married Wallace Fitzgerald, a former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] officer whom young Roy despised.&lt;ref name="Royce"/&gt; Fitzgerald adopted his stepson without his consent, whose legal name then became Roy Fitzgerald.&lt;ref name="Royce"/&gt; That marriage eventually ended in a bitter divorce and produced no children.&lt;ref name="Royce"/&gt;

Hudson attended [[New Trier High School]] in Winnetka.&lt;ref name="Royce"/&gt; He sang in the school [[glee club]], and later was remembered as a shy boy who delivered newspapers, ran errands, and worked as a [[golf caddy]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}  At some point during his teenage years, he worked as an usher in a movie theater and developed an interest in acting.&lt;ref name="tcmdb"/&gt; He tried out for a number of school plays, but failed to win any roles because he could not remember his lines, a problem that continued to occur through his early acting career.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt;

He graduated from high school in 1943, and the following year enlisted in the [[United States Navy]], during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Royce"/&gt; After training at the [[Great Lakes Naval Training Station]], he departed San Francisco aboard the troop transport [[List of Liberty ships (Je–L)|SS ''Lew Wallace'']], with orders to report to Aviation Repair and Overhaul Unit 2, then located on [[Samar]], Philippines, as an [[aircraft mechanic]].{{sfn|Wise|1997|p=178}}&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Berger, Joseph, [http://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/science/aids/100385sci-aids.html "Rock Hudson, Screen Idol, Dies at 59"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 3, 1985; retrieved February 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, he returned to San Francisco aboard an aircraft carrier,{{sfn|Wise|1997|p=180}} and was discharged the same year.&lt;ref name="Royce"/&gt;

Hudson then moved to Los Angeles to live with his biological father, who had remarried,&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt; and to pursue an acting career. Initially he worked at odd jobs,&lt;ref name="Royce"/&gt; including as a truck driver.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt; He applied to the [[University of Southern California]]'s dramatics program, but was rejected due to poor grades.&lt;ref name="tcmdb"/&gt; After he sent talent scout [[Henry Willson]] a picture of himself in 1947, Willson took him on as a client, and changed the young actor's name to Rock Hudson; later in his life Hudson admitted that he hated the name.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt; The name was coined by combining the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] and the [[Hudson River]].&lt;ref name="Rock Hudson"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Rock Hudson|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001369/bio|website=IMDb|access-date=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Hudson made his acting debut with a small part in the [[Warner Bros.]] film ''[[Fighter Squadron]]'' (1948), and took 38 takes to successfully deliver his only line in the film.&lt;ref&gt;''The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson: The Pretty Boys and Dirty Deals of Henry Willson'' by Robert Hofler, Carroll &amp; Graf, 2005, pp. 163–64; {{ISBN|0-7867-1607-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Universal-International===
Hudson was signed to a long-term contract by [[Universal Pictures|Universal-International]]. There he received coaching in acting, singing, dancing, [[fencing (sport)|fencing]], and [[horseback riding]], and began to be featured in film magazines where, being photogenic, he was promoted.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt;

His first film at Universal was ''[[Undertow (1949 film)|Undertow]]'' (1949), which gave him his first screen credit. He had small parts in ''[[Peggy (1950 film)|Peggy]]'' (1950), ''[[Winchester '73]]'' (1950) as an American Indian, ''[[The Desert Hawk (1950 film)|The Desert Hawk]]'' (1950) (as an Arab), ''[[Tomahawk (film)|Tomahawk]]'' (1951), and ''[[Air Cadet (film)|Air Cadet]]'' (1951).

Hudson was billed third in ''[[The Fat Man (film)|The Fat Man]]'' (1951), but back down the cast list for ''[[Bright Victory]]'' (1951). He had a good part as a boxer in ''[[Iron Man (1951 film)|Iron Man]]'' (1951), starring [[Jeff Chandler]], and as a gambler in ''[[Bend of the River]]'' (1952). He supported the Nelson family in ''[[Here Come the Nelsons]]'' (1951).

===Leading man===
Hudson was promoted to leading man for ''[[Scarlet Angel]]'' (1952), opposite [[Yvonne De Carlo]], who had been in ''Desert Hawk'' and ''Tomahawk''. He co-starred with [[Piper Laurie]] in a comedy, ''[[Has Anybody Seen My Gal? (film)|Has Anybody Seen My Gal?]]'' (1952), the first of his films directed by [[Douglas Sirk]].

In ''[[Horizons West]]'' (1952) Hudson supported [[Robert Ryan]], but he was star again for a pair of Westerns, ''[[The Lawless Breed]]'' (1953) and ''[[Seminole (film)|Seminole]]'' (1953). In 1953 he appeared in a [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]] commercial which showed him on the set of ''[[Seminole (film)|Seminole]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Rock Hudson (Actor)|year=1953|title=Camel Cigarette Commercials, 16mm Transfers Reel # 8.

[[File:Taylor - Hudson - Giant.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hudson, pictured with [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), the film that led to his only [[Academy Award]] nomination]]

He and De Carlo were borrowed by [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] for ''[[Sea Devils (1953 film)|Sea Devils]]'' (1953), an adventure set during the Napoleonic Wars. Back at Universal he played [[Harun al-Rashid]] in an "Eastern", ''[[The Golden Blade]]'' (1953). There was ''[[Gun Fury]]'' (1953), a Western, and ''[[Back to God's Country (1953 film)|Back to God's Country]]'' (1953). Hudson had the title role in ''[[Taza, Son of Cochise]]'' (1954), directed by Sirk and produced by [[Ross Hunter]].

===''Magnificent Obsession'' and stardom===
Hudson was by now firmly established as a leading man in B adventure films. What turned him into a star was the romantic drama ''[[Magnificent Obsession (1954 film)|Magnificent Obsession]]'' (1954), co-starring [[Jane Wyman]], produced by Hunter and directed by Sirk.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kashner|first1=Sam|last2=MacNair|first2=Jennifer|title=The bad &amp; the beautiful : Hollywood in the fifties|date=2003|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=0-393-32436-2|pages=144–54|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received positive reviews, with ''Modern Screen Magazine'' citing Hudson as the most popular actor of the year. It made over $5&amp;nbsp;million at the box-office.

Hudson returned to adventure films with ''[[Bengal Brigade]]'' (1954), set during the Indian Mutiny, and ''[[Captain Lightfoot]]'' (1955), produced by Hunter and directed by Sirk. In 1954, exhibitors voted Hudson the 17th most popular star in the country.

Hunter used him in two melodramas, ''[[One Desire]]'' (1955) with [[Anne Baxter]], and ''[[All That Heaven Allows]]'' (1955), which reunited him with Sirk and Wyman. ''[[Never Say Goodbye (1956 film)|Never Say Goodbye]]'' (1956) was more drama.

===''Giant'' (1956)===
Hudson's popularity soared with [[George Stevens]]' film ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956). Hudson and his co-star [[James Dean]] were both nominated for [[Academy Award|Oscars]] in the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] category. Another hit was ''[[Written on the Wind]]'' (1957), directed by Sirk and produced by [[Albert Zugsmith]]. Sirk also directed Hudson in ''[[Battle Hymn (film)|Battle Hymn]]'' (1957), produced by Hudson, playing [[Dean Hess]]. These films propelled Hudson to be voted the most popular actor in American cinemas in 1957. He stayed in the "top ten" until 1964.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Hudson was borrowed by [[MGM]] to appear in [[Richard Brooks]]' ''[[Something of Value]]'' (1957), a box-office disappointment. So too was his next film, a remake of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1957 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1957). To make ''A Farewell to Arms'', he reportedly turned down [[Marlon Brando]]'s role in ''[[Sayonara]]'', [[William Holden]]'s role in ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'', and [[Charlton Heston]]'s role in ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001369/bio|title=Rock Hudson Biography|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Farewell to Arms'' received negative reviews, failed at the box office and became the last production by [[David O. Selznick]].&lt;ref&gt;David Thomson (1993). ''Showman: The Life of David O. Selznick'', London: Abacus, p. 656. {{ISBN|978-0349105239}}, {{OCLC|1000546022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hudson was reunited with the producer, director and two stars of ''Written on the Wind'' in ''[[The Tarnished Angels]]'' (1958), at Universal. He then made an adventure story, ''[[Twilight for the Gods]]'' (1958). ''[[This Earth Is Mine (1959 film)|This Earth Is Mine]]'' (1959) was a melodrama.

===Romantic comedy star===
[[File:Rock Hudson - Julie Andrews.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Hudson and [[Julie Andrews]] in ''[[Darling Lili]]'', one of the many romantic comedies he filmed in the 1960s]]
Ross Hunter teamed Hudson with [[Doris Day]] in a romantic comedy, ''[[Pillow Talk (film)|Pillow Talk]]'' (1959), which was a massive hit. Hudson was voted the most popular star in the country for 1959, and would be the second most popular for the next three years.

Less popular was a Western, ''[[The Last Sunset (film)|The Last Sunset]]'' (1961), co-starring [[Kirk Douglas]]. Hudson then made two hugely popular comedies: ''[[Come September]]'' (1961) with [[Gina Lollobrigida]], [[Sandra Dee]] and [[Bobby Darin]], directed by [[Robert Mulligan]]; and ''[[Lover Come Back (1961 film)|Lover Come Back]]'' (1961) with Day.

He made two dramas: ''[[The Spiral Road]]'' (1962) was a medical adventure story, directed by Mulligan, and ''[[A Gathering of Eagles]]'' (1963), a military story, directed by [[Delbert Mann]]. Nonetheless, Hudson was still voted the third most popular star in 1963. Hudson went back to comedy for ''[[Man's Favorite Sport?]]'' (1964), directed by [[Howard Hawks]] and, more popularly, ''[[Send Me No Flowers]]'' (1964), this third and final film with Day. Along with [[Cary Grant]], Hudson was regarded as one of the best-dressed male stars in Hollywood, and received Top 10 Stars of the Year a record-setting eight times from 1957 to 1964.

===Decline as a star===
''[[Strange Bedfellows (1965 film)|Strange Bedfellows]]'' (1965), with [[Gina Lollobrigida]], was a box office disappointment. So too was ''[[A Very Special Favor]]'' (1965), despite having the same writer and director as ''Pillow Talk''. That year he was voted the 11th most popular star in the country, and he would never beat that rank again.

Hudson tried a thriller, ''[[Blindfold (1966 film)|Blindfold]]'' (1966). He worked outside his usual range on the science-fiction thriller ''[[Seconds (1966 film)|Seconds]]'' (1966), directed by [[John Frankenheimer]]. The film may contain Hudson's best performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gillies|first=Jamie|url=http://www.apolloguide.com/mov_fullrev.asp?CID=3835|title=Seconds|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040915124517/http://www.apolloguide.com/mov_fullrev.asp?CID=3835|date=September 15, 2004|work=apollo guide|archive-date=September 15, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also tried his hand in the action genre with ''[[Tobruk (1967 film)|Tobruk]]'' (1967), a World War Two film directed by [[Arthur Hiller]]. After the comedy ''[[A Fine Pair]]'' (1968) with [[Claudia Cardinale]] he starred in the action thriller ''[[Ice Station Zebra]]'' (1968) at MGM, a role which he had actively sought and remained his personal favorite. The film was a hit but struggled to recoup its large cost.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Hudson dabbled in westerns, appearing opposite [[John Wayne]] in ''[[The Undefeated (1969 film)|The Undefeated]]'' (1969). He co-starred opposite [[Julie Andrews]] in the [[Blake Edwards]] musical ''[[Darling Lili]]'' (1970), which was reasonably popular but it became notorious for its huge cost.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Television===
During the 1970s and 1980s, he starred in a number of TV movies and series. His most successful television series was ''[[McMillan &amp; Wife]]'' opposite [[Susan Saint James]], which ran from 1971 to 1977. Hudson played [[police commissioner]] Stewart "Mac" McMillan, with Saint James as his wife Sally, and their on-screen chemistry helped make the show a hit.

During the series' run Hudson appeared in ''[[Showdown (1973 film)|Showdown]]'' (1973), a western with [[Dean Martin]], and ''[[Embryo (1976 film)|Embryo]]'' (1976), a science fiction film. Hudson took a risk and surprised many by making a successful foray into live theater late in his career, the best received of his efforts being ''[[I Do! I Do!]]'' in 1974.
[[File:Rock Hudson en 'Embryo'.png|thumb|right|250px|Hudson in the lead role of ''[[Embryo (1976 film)|Embryo]]'' (1976), a horror/sci-fi film]]
After ''McMillan'' ended, Hudson made a disaster movie for [[New World Pictures]], ''[[Avalanche (1978 film)|Avalanche]]'' (1978), and two miniseries, ''[[Wheels (novel)|Wheels]]'' (1978) and ''[[The Martian Chronicles (miniseries)|The Martian Chronicles]]'' (1980). He was one of several faded stars in ''[[The Mirror Crack'd]]'' (1980) and co-starred in ''[[The Beatrice Arthur Special]]'' (1980).

===Later years===
{{more citations needed section|date=August 2017}}
In the early 1980s, following years of heavy drinking and smoking, Hudson began having health problems which resulted in a heart attack in November 1981. Emergency quintuple heart bypass surgery sidelined Hudson and his new TV show ''[[The Devlin Connection]]'' for a year, and the show was canceled in December 1982 soon after it had first aired.

Hudson recovered from the heart surgery but continued to smoke. He nevertheless continued to work with appearances in several TV movies such as ''[[World War III (miniseries)|World War III]]'' (1982). He was in ill health while filming the action-drama film ''[[The Ambassador (1984 American film)|The Ambassador]]'' in Israel during the winter months from late 1983 to early 1984. He reportedly did not get along with his co-star [[Robert Mitchum]], who had a serious drinking problem and often clashed off-camera with Hudson and other cast and crew members.&lt;ref&gt;Server, Lee ''Baby, I Don't Care'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

From December 1984 to April 1985, Hudson appeared in a recurring role on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] prime time soap opera ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' as [[Daniel Reece (Dynasty character)|Daniel Reece]], a wealthy horse breeder and a potential love interest for [[Krystle Carrington]] (played by [[Linda Evans]]), as well as the biological father of the character [[Sammy Jo Carrington]] ([[Heather Locklear]]). While Hudson had long been known to have difficulty memorizing lines, which resulted in his use of [[cue card]]s, it was his speech itself that began to visibly deteriorate on ''Dynasty.'' He was originally slated to appear for the duration of the show's second half of its fifth season; however, because of his progressing ill health, his character was abruptly written out of the show and died off-screen.

==Personal life==
While his career developed, Hudson and his agent [[Henry Willson]] kept the actor's personal life out of the headlines. In 1955, ''[[Confidential (magazine)|Confidential]]'' magazine threatened to publish an exposé about Hudson's secret homosexuality. Willson stalled this by disclosing information about two of his other clients.  Willson provided information about [[Rory Calhoun]]'s years in prison and the arrest of [[Tab Hunter]] at a party in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;See: Hofler, Robert. ''The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson: The Pretty Boys and Dirty Deals of Henry Willson.'' New York: Carroll &amp; Graf, 2005, pp. 248–50; Oppenheimer, Jerry and Vitek, Jack.

Soon after the ''Confidential'' incident, Hudson [[lavender marriage|married]] Willson's secretary [[Phyllis Gates]].

According to the biography ''Rock Hudson: His Story'' (1986) by Hudson and [[Sara Davidson]], Hudson was good friends with novelist [[Armistead Maupin]]. The book also names certain of Hudson's lovers, including Jack Coates; Tom Clark (who published a memoir about Hudson, ''Rock Hudson: Friend of Mine''); actor and stockbroker Lee Garlington;&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Rock; Davidson, Sarah ''Rock Hudson: History'', Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers 1986, pp. 92–95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McNeil|first1=Eizabeth|title=Rock Hudson's 'True Love' Speaks: How We Kept Our Gay Life Secret|url=http://www.people.com/article/rock-hudson-boyfriend-lee-garlington-gay-life?xid=socialflow_facebook_peoplemag?ir=Gay%20Voices|publisher=People|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Marc Christian (born Marc Christian MacGinnis), who later won a suit against the Hudson estate.

An [[urban legend]] states that Hudson married [[Jim Nabors]] in the early 1970s. Not only was [[same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] not recognized under the laws of any American state at the time, but, at least publicly, Hudson and Nabors were nothing more than friends. According to Hudson, the legend originated with a group of "middle-aged homosexuals who live in [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]]" who sent out joke invitations for their annual get-together. One year, the group invited its members to witness "the marriage of Rock Hudson and Jim Nabors", at which Hudson would take the surname of Nabors's character, [[Gomer Pyle]], becoming Rock Pyle.

The joke was evidently already in the mainstream by this time; in the October 1972 edition of ''[[Mad (magazine)|MAD]]'' magazine (issue no. 154), an article entitled "When Watching Television, You Can be Sure of Seeing...", gossip columnist 'Rona Boring' states: "And there isn't a grain of truth to the vicious rumor that movie and TV star Rock Heman and singer Jim Nelly were secretly married! Rock and Jim are just good buddies! I repeat, they are not married! They are not even going steady!" Those who failed to get the joke spread the rumor and as a result, Hudson and Nabors (then still [[closeted|in the closet]]) never spoke to each other again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Barbara Mikkelson|title=Good Nabors Policy|url=http://www.snopes.com/movies/actors/nabors.htm|publisher=Snopes|date=August 10, 2007|accessdate=September 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he was raised [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], Hudson later identified as an [[Atheism|atheist]]. A week before Hudson died, his publicist Tom Clark asked a priest to visit. Hudson made a confession, received communion, and was administered last rites. Hudson was also visited by a [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] prayer group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Long Goodbye: Rock Hudson, 1925–85|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20091996,00.html|website=people.com|access-date=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illness and death==
[[File:Reagans with Rock Hudson.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Hudson (left) with President [[Ronald Reagan]] and first lady [[Nancy Reagan]] at a White House state dinner, May 1984, less than three weeks before he was diagnosed with HIV.]]
Unknown to the public, Hudson was diagnosed with HIV on June 5, 1984, just three years after the emergence of the first cluster of symptomatic patients in the U.S., and only one year after the initial identification by scientists of the HIV virus that causes [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. Over the next several months, Hudson kept his illness a secret and continued to work while, at the same time, traveling to France and other countries seeking a cure&amp;nbsp;– or at least treatment to slow the progress of the disease.

On July 16, 1985, Hudson joined his old friend [[Doris Day]] for a Hollywood press conference announcing the launch of her new TV cable show ''Doris Day's Best Friends'' in which Hudson was videotaped visiting Day's ranch in [[Carmel, California]], a few days earlier. He appeared gaunt and his speech was nearly incoherent; during the segment, Hudson did very little speaking, with most of it consisting of Day and Hudson walking around as Day's recording of "[[My Buddy (song)|My Buddy]]" played in the background, with Hudson noting he had quickly tired out. His appearance was enough of a shock that the reunion was broadcast repeatedly over national news shows that night and for days to come. Media outlets speculated on Hudson's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20202713,00.html|title=Hudson's Day of Revelation|last=Martin|first=James A.|date=July 11, 1997|publisher=ew.com|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day later acknowledged: "He was very sick.

Two days later, Hudson traveled to Paris, France, for another round of treatment. After Hudson collapsed in his room at the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris|Ritz Hotel in Paris]] on July 21, his publicist, [[Dale Olson]], released a statement claiming that Hudson had inoperable [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]]. Olson denied reports that Hudson had AIDS and would say only that he was undergoing tests for "everything" at the [[American Hospital of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=negLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gVkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7186,1909318&amp;dq=rock+hudson+liver+cancer&amp;hl=en|title=Hospital: Hudson liver cancer report is false|last=Dunphy|first=Harry|date=July 24, 1985|work=The Evening Independent|page=3-A|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, four days later, July 25, 1985, Hudson's French publicist Yanou Collart confirmed that Hudson did in fact have AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hudson Has AIDS, Spokesman Says|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/26/arts/hudson-has-aids-spokesman-says.html|accessdate=November 24, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=July 26, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Services|first1=From Times Wire|title=Rock Hudson Has Had AIDS for Year – Friend|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-07-25/news/mn-5849_1_aids-specialists|accessdate=November 24, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 25, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was among the first mainstream celebrities to have been diagnosed with the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QOUjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XdcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1036,2868450&amp;dq=rock+hudson+aids+confirm&amp;hl=en|title=AIDS diagnosis is confirmed|date=July 26, 1985|work=The Modesto Bee|page=A-3|accessdate=December 25, 2012}} {{Dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disclosure of Hudson's AIDS diagnosis provoked widespread public discussion of his homosexual identity. In ''[[Logical Family: A Memoir]]'', gay author [[Armistead Maupin]], who was a friend of Hudson's, writes he was the first person to confirm to the press that Hudson was gay in 1985, effectively [[outing]] him. Maupin explains that he said it to [[Randy Shilts]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', and that he was annoyed that producer [[Ross Hunter]], who was gay himself, denied it.&lt;ref name="logicalfamily211"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maupin|first1=Armistead|title=[[Logical Family: A Memoir]]|date=2017|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=978-0857523518|pages=211–12|quote=When the Chronicle reporter called, I kept it simple: I said yes of course, Rock was widely known in the industry to be gay, so there was no scandal at all here beyond the fact that it had taken this horrendous disease to demolish the charade that had made Rock's life miserable for so long.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its August 15, 1985, issue, [[People (magazine)|''People'']] magazine published a story that discussed his disease in the context of his sexuality. The largely sympathetic article featured comments from show business colleagues such as [[Angie Dickinson]], [[Robert Stack]], and [[Mamie Van Doren]], who claimed they knew about Hudson's homosexuality and expressed their support for him.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt; At that time, ''People'' had a circulation of more than 2.8&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Edwin. "Celebrating Celebrity: The New Gossips". ''[[New York Magazine]]'', Vol. 18, No. 19. May 13, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; and, as a result of this and other stories, Hudson's homosexuality became fully public. Hudson's revelation had an immediate impact on the visibility of AIDS, and on the funding of medical research related to the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Colin (December 20, 1985). "AIDS therapy: new push for clinical trials". ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. Vol. 230, pp.&amp;nbsp;1355–58. Retrieved via ''Biography in Context'' database, November 19, 2017.

Shortly after Hudson's press release disclosing his infection, [[William M. Hoffman]], the author of ''[[As Is (play)|As Is]]'', a play about AIDS that appeared on Broadway in 1985, stated: "If Rock Hudson can have it, nice people can have it. It's just a disease, not a moral affliction."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; At the same time, [[Joan Rivers]] was quoted as saying: "Two years ago, when I hosted a benefit for AIDS, I couldn't get one major star to turn out. ...

Shortly after his death, ''People'' reported: "Since Hudson made his announcement, more than $1.8 million in private contributions (more than double the amount collected in 1984) has been raised to support AIDS research and to care for AIDS victims (5,523 reported in 1985 alone).

However, Hudson's revelation did not immediately dispel the stigma of AIDS.

After Hudson revealed his diagnosis, a controversy arose concerning his participation in a scene in the television drama ''Dynasty'' in which he shared a long and repeated kiss with actress [[Linda Evans]] in one episode (first aired in February 1985). When filming the scene, Hudson was aware that he had AIDS, but did not inform Evans. Some felt that he should have disclosed his condition to her beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;Haller, Scot.

==Lawsuits==
Following Hudson's death, Marc Christian, Hudson's former lover, sued his estate on grounds of "intentional infliction of emotional distress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Willard Manus|title=The Cleaning Man Airs Rock Hudson's Dirty Laundry in L.A.|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/57447.html|work=Playbill|date=December 18, 2000|accessdate=September 5, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184641/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/57447.html|archivedate=September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian claimed Hudson continued having sex with him until February 1985, more than eight months after Hudson knew that he had HIV. Although he repeatedly tested negative for HIV, Christian claimed that he suffered from "severe emotional distress" after learning from a July 25, 1985 newscast that Hudson had been diagnosed with AIDS. Christian also sued Hudson's personal secretary, Mark Miller, for $10&amp;nbsp;million because Miller allegedly lied to him about Hudson's illness. In 1989, a jury awarded Christian $21.75&amp;nbsp;million in damages, later reduced to $5.5&amp;nbsp;million. Christian later defended Hudson's reputation in not telling him he was infected: "You can't dismiss a man's whole life with a single act.

In the book Clark said he believed Hudson acquired HIV from blood transfusions during quintuple bypass open-heart surgery in 1981; never acknowledged that their relationship went beyond being roommates;&lt;ref&gt;Colker, David. "Rock Hudson: Friend Of Mine", ''Los Angeles Times'', April 29, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; and characterized Christian as disreputable. Christian filed a $22 million libel suit against the authors and publisher, charging that he had been labelled "a criminal, a thief, an unclean person, a blackmailer, a psychotic, an extortionist, a forger, a perjurer, a liar, a whore, an arsonist and a squatter".&lt;ref&gt;McGraw, Carol "Rock Hudson Ex-Lover Files Libel Suit", ''Los Angeles Times'', April 5, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Robert Park Mills, the attorney who represented the Hudson estate against Christian in court, released a book entitled ''Between Rock and a Hard Place: In Defense of Rock Hudson''. In the book, Mills discusses details of the trial and also questions Christian's allegations against Hudson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parker Mills|first=Robert |title=Between Rock and a Hard Place: In Defense of Rock Hudson: From the Ashes of Trial to the Light of Truth|year=2010|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=1-456-70039-1|pages=x–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
