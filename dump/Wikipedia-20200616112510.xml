Mitochondrial DNA is only a small portion of the DNA in a eukaryotic cell; most of the DNA can be found in the [[cell nucleus]] and, in plants and algae, also in [[plastid]]s such as [[chloroplast]]s.

[[Human mitochondrial DNA]] was the first significant part of the [[human genome]] to be sequenced.&lt;ref name="pmid7219534"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Anderson S, Bankier AT, Barrell BG, de Bruijn MH, Coulson AR, Drouin J, Eperon IC, Nierlich DP, Roe BA, Sanger F, Schreier PH, Smith AJ, Staden R, Young IG.| title=Sequence and organization of the human mitochondrial genome. | journal=Nature | year= 1981 | volume= 290 | issue= 5806 | pages= 457–65 | pmid=7219534 | doi=10.1038/290457a0 | bibcode=1981Natur.290..457A }}&lt;/ref&gt; This sequencing revealed that the human mtDNA includes 16,569 base pairs and encodes 13 [[protein]]s.

It also permits an examination of the relatedness of populations, and so has become important in [[anthropology]] and [[biogeography]].

== Origin ==
Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA are thought to be of separate [[evolution]]ary origin, with the mtDNA being derived from the circular genomes of the [[bacteria]] that were engulfed by the early ancestors of today's eukaryotic cells. This theory is called the [[endosymbiotic theory]]. In the cells of extant organisms, the vast majority of the proteins present in the mitochondria (numbering approximately 1500 different types in [[mammal]]s) are coded for by [[nuclear DNA]], but the genes for some, if not most, of them are thought to have originally been of bacterial origin, having since been transferred to the [[eukaryotic]] nucleus during [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="Johnston, I. G. and Williams, B. P. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnston IG, Williams BP | title = Evolutionary Inference across Eukaryotes Identifies Specific Pressures Favoring Mitochondrial Gene Retention | journal = Cell Systems | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 101–11 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 27135164 | doi = 10.1016/j.cels.2016.01.013 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons why mitochondria have retained some genes are debated. The existence in some species of mitochondrion-derived organelles lacking a genome&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=van der Giezen |first1=Mark |last2=Tovar |first2=Jorge |last3=Clark |first3=C. Graham | name-list-format = vanc |chapter=Mitochondrion‐Derived Organelles in Protists and Fungi |title=A Survey of Cell Biology |volume=244 |pages=175–225 |year=2005 |pmid=16157181 |doi=10.1016/S0074-7696(05)44005-X |isbn=978-0-12-364648-4 |series=International Review of Cytology }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that complete gene loss is possible, and transferring mitochondrial genes to the nucleus has several advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adams KL, Palmer JD | title = Evolution of mitochondrial gene content: gene loss and transfer to the nucleus | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 380–95 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14615181 | doi = 10.1016/S1055-7903(03)00194-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty of targeting remotely-produced hydrophobic protein products to the mitochondrion is one hypothesis for why some genes are retained in mtDNA;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Björkholm P, Harish A, Hagström E, Ernst AM, Andersson SG | title = Mitochondrial genomes are retained by selective constraints on protein targeting | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 112 | issue = 33 | pages = 10154–61 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26195779 | pmc = 4547212 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1421372112 | bibcode = 2015PNAS..11210154B }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CoRR hypothesis|colocalisation for redox regulation]] is another, citing the desirability of localised control over mitochondrial machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen JF | title = Why chloroplasts and mitochondria retain their own genomes and genetic systems: Colocation for redox regulation of gene expression | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 112 | issue = 33 | pages = 10231–8 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26286985 | pmc = 4547249 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1500012112 | bibcode = 2015PNAS..11210231A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent analysis of a wide range of mtDNA genomes suggests that both these features may dictate mitochondrial gene retention.&lt;ref name="Johnston, I. G. and Williams, B. P. 2016"/&gt;

== Genome structure and diversity ==
There are six main genome types found in mitochondrial genomes, classified by their structure (e.g. circular versus linear), size, presence of [[intron]]s or [[Plasmid|plasmid like structures]], and whether the genetic material is a singular molecule or collection of [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous]] or [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] molecules.&lt;ref name="Kolesnikov, A. A. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kolesnikov AA, Gerasimov ES | title = Diversity of mitochondrial genome organization | journal = Biochemistry. Biokhimiia | volume = 77 | issue = 13 | pages = 1424–35 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23379519 | doi = 10.1134/S0006297912130020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many unicellular organisms (e.g., the [[ciliate]] ''[[Tetrahymena]]'' and the [[green alga]] ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]''), and in rare cases also in multicellular organisms (e.g. in some species of [[Cnidaria]]), the mtDNA is found as linearly organized [[DNA]]. Most of these linear mtDNAs possess [[telomerase]]-independent [[telomere]]s (i.e., the ends of the linear [[DNA]]) with different modes of replication, which have made them interesting objects of research because many of these unicellular organisms with linear mtDNA are known [[pathogen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nosek J, Tomáska L, Fukuhara H, Suyama Y, Kovác L | title = Linear mitochondrial genomes: 30 years down the line | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 184–8 | date = May 1998 | pmid = 9613202 | doi = 10.1016/S0168-9525(98)01443-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animals ===
There is only one mitochondrial genome type found in animal cells. This genome usually contains one circular molecule with between 11–28 kbp ([[Base pair#Length measurements|kilo base pairs]]) of genetic material (type 1).&lt;ref name="Kolesnikov, A. A. 2012"/&gt;

In February 2020, a jellyfish-related parasite – ''[[Henneguya salminicola]]'' – was discovered that lacks mitochondrial genome but retains structures deemed mitochondrion-related
organelles. Moreover, nuclear DNA genes involved in aerobic respiration and in mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription were either absent or present only as pseudogenes. This is the first multicellular organism known to have this absence of aerobic respiration and lives completely free of oxygen dependency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yahalomi |first1=Dayana |last2=Atkinson |first2=Stephen D. |last3=Neuhof |first3=Moran |last4=Chang |first4=E. Sally |last5=Philippe |first5=Hervé |last6=Cartwright |first6=Paulyn |last7=Bartholomew |first7=Jerri L. |last8=Huchon |first8=Dorothée |title=A cnidarian parasite of salmon (Myxozoa: ''Henneguya'') lacks a mitochondrial genome |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=10 March 2020 |volume=117 |issue=10 |pages=5358–5363 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1909907117 |pmid=32094163 |pmc=7071853 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sciencealert.com/this-is-the-first-known-animal-that-doesn-t-need-oxygen-to-survive |title=Scientists Find The First-Ever Animal That Doesn't Need Oxygen to Survive |last=Starr |first=Michelle |website=ScienceAlert |language=en-gb |access-date=2020-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plants and fungi ===
There are three different genome types found in plants and fungi. The first type is a circular genome that has introns (type 2) and may range from 19 to 1000 kbp in length. The second genome type is a circular genome (about 20–1000 kbp) that also has a plasmid-like structure (1 kb) (type 3). The final genome type that can be found in plant and fungi is a linear genome made up of homogeneous DNA molecules (type 5).

Great variation in mtDNA gene content and size exists among fungi and plants, although there appears to be a core subset of genes that are present in all eukaryotes (except for the few that have no mitochondria at all).&lt;ref name="Johnston, I. G. and Williams, B. P. 2016"/&gt;
Some plant species have enormous mitochondrial genomes, with ''[[Silene conica]]'' mtDNA containing as many as 11,300,000 base pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sloan DB, Alverson AJ, Chuckalovcak JP, Wu M, McCauley DE, Palmer JD, Taylor DR | title = Rapid evolution of enormous, multichromosomal genomes in flowering plant mitochondria with exceptionally high mutation rates | journal = PLOS Biology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = e1001241 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22272183 | pmc = 3260318 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001241 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, even those huge mtDNAs contain the same number and kinds of genes as related plants with much smaller mtDNAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ward BL, Anderson RS, Bendich AJ | title = The mitochondrial genome is large and variable in a family of plants (cucurbitaceae) | journal = Cell | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 793–803 | date = September 1981 | pmid = 6269758 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(81)90187-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The genome of the mitochondrion of the cucumber (''[[Cucumis sativus]]'') consists of three circular chromosomes (lengths 1556, 84 and 45 kilobases), which are entirely or largely autonomous with regard to their [[DNA replication|replication]].&lt;ref name=Alverson2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alverson AJ, Rice DW, Dickinson S, Barry K, Palmer JD | title = Origins and recombination of the bacterial-sized multichromosomal mitochondrial genome of cucumber | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 2499–513 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21742987 | pmc = 3226218 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.111.087189 | jstor = 41433488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protists ===
Protists contain the most diverse mitochondrial genomes, with five different types found in this kingdom. Type 2, type 3 and type 5 mentioned in the plant and fungal genomes also exist in some protists, as do two unique genome types. One of these unique types is a heterogeneous collection of circular DNA molecules (type 4) while the other is a heterogeneous collection of linear molecules (type 6). Genome types 4 and 6 each range from 1–200 kbp in size.

The smallest mitochondrial genome sequenced to date is the 5,967 bp mtDNA of the parasite ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.idtdna.com/pages/docs/educational-resources/mitochondrial-dna.pdf?sfvrsn=4|title=Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)|publisher=Integrated DNA Technologies|access-date=25 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729031823/https://www.idtdna.com/pages/docs/educational-resources/mitochondrial-dna.pdf?sfvrsn=4|archive-date=29 July 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tyagi S, Pande V, Das A | title = Whole mitochondrial genome sequence of an Indian Plasmodium falciparum field isolate | language = English | journal = The Korean Journal of Parasitology | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 99–103 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24623891 | pmc = 3949004 | doi = 10.3347/kjp.2014.52.1.99 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endosymbiotic gene transfer, the process by which genes that were coded in the mitochondrial genome are transferred to the cell's main genome, likely explains why more complex organisms such as humans have smaller mitochondrial genomes than simpler organisms such as protists.

== Replication ==
Mitochondrial DNA is replicated by the [[DNA polymerase]] gamma complex which is composed of a 140 kDa catalytic DNA polymerase encoded by the ''[[POLG]]'' gene and two 55 kDa accessory subunits encoded by the ''[[POLG2]]'' gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yakubovskaya E, Chen Z, Carrodeguas JA, Kisker C, Bogenhagen DF | title = Functional human mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma forms a heterotrimer | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 281 | issue = 1 | pages = 374–82 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16263719 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M509730200 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The replisome machinery is formed by DNA polymerase, [[PEO1|TWINKLE]] and mitochondrial [[SSB protein]]s. [[PEO1|TWINKLE]] is a [[helicase]], which unwinds short stretches of dsDNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction.&lt;ref name=Jemt2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jemt E, Farge G, Bäckström S, Holmlund T, Gustafsson CM, Falkenberg M |authorlink6=Maria Falkenberg| title = The mitochondrial DNA helicase TWINKLE can assemble on a closed circular template and support initiation of DNA synthesis | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 39 | issue = 21 | pages = 9238–49 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 21840902 | pmc = 3241658 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkr653 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All these polypeptides are encoded in the nuclear genome.

During [[embryogenesis]], replication of mtDNA is strictly down-regulated from the fertilized oocyte through the preimplantation embryo.&lt;ref name=John2010/&gt; The resulting reduction in per-cell copy number of mtDNA plays a role in the mitochondrial bottleneck, exploiting [[cellular noise|cell-to-cell variability]] to ameliorate the inheritance of damaging mutations.&lt;ref name=pmid26035426/&gt; According to Justin St. John and colleagues, "At the [[blastocyst]] stage, the onset of mtDNA replication is specific to the cells of the [[trophectoderm]].&lt;ref name=John2010/&gt; In contrast, the cells of the [[inner cell mass]] restrict mtDNA replication until they receive the [[Cell signaling|signals]] to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] to specific cell types."&lt;ref name=John2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = St John JC, Facucho-Oliveira J, Jiang Y, Kelly R, Salah R | title = Mitochondrial DNA transmission, replication and inheritance: a journey from the gamete through the embryo and into offspring and embryonic stem cells | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 488–509 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20231166 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq002 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genes on the mtDNA and their transcription ==
The two strands of the human mitochondrial DNA are distinguished as the heavy strand and the light strand. The heavy strand is rich in guanine and encodes 12 subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation system, two ribosomal RNAs (12S and 16S), and 14 tRNAs. The light strand encodes one subunit, and 8 tRNAs. So, altogether mtDNA encodes for two rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and 13 proteins subunits, all of which are involved in the oxidative phosphorylation process.&lt;ref name="pmid29945721"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barshad G, Marom S, Cohen T, Mishmar D | title=Mitochondrial DNA Transcription and Its Regulation: An Evolutionary Perspective. | journal=Trends Genet | year= 2018 | volume= 34 | issue= 9 | pages= 682–692 | pmid=29945721 | doi=10.1016/j.tig.2018.05.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid31064115"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Barchiesi A, Vascotto C| title=Transcription, Processing, and Decay of Mitochondrial RNA in Health and Disease. | journal=Int J Mol Sci | year= 2019 | volume= 20 | issue= 9 | pages=  2221| pmid=31064115 | doi=10.3390/ijms20092221 | pmc=6540609 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between most (but not all) protein-coding regions, tRNAs are present (see the [[#Map of the human mitochondrial genome|human mitochondrial genome map]]). During transcription, the tRNAs acquire their characteristic L-shape that gets recognized and cleaved by specific enzymes. With the mitochondrial RNA processing, individual mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA sequences are released from the primary transcript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Falkenberg M, Larsson NG, Gustafsson CM | title = DNA replication and transcription in mammalian mitochondria | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 76 | issue = 1 | pages = 679–99 | date = 2007-06-19 | pmid = 17408359 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.76.060305.152028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Folded tRNAs therefore act as secondary structure punctuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ojala D, Montoya J, Attardi G | title = tRNA punctuation model of RNA processing in human mitochondria | journal = Nature | volume = 290 | issue = 5806 | pages = 470–4 | date = April 1981 | pmid = 7219536 | doi = 10.1038/290470a0 | bibcode = 1981Natur.290..470O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation of transcription===

The promoters for the initiation of the transcription of the heavy and light strands are located in the main non-coding region of the mtDNA called the displacement loop, the D-loop.&lt;ref name="pmid29945721" /&gt; There is evidence that the transcription of the mitochondrial rRNAs is regulated by the heavy-strand promoter 1 (HSP1), and the transcription of the polycistronic transcripts coding for the protein subunits are regulated by HSP2.&lt;ref name="pmid29945721" /&gt;

Measurement of the levels of the mtDNA-encoded RNAs in bovine tissues has shown that there are major differences in the expression of the mitochondrial RNAs relative to total tissue RNA.&lt;ref name="1993-Raikhinstein"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raikhinstein M, Hanukoglu I | title = Mitochondrial-genome-encoded RNAs: differential regulation by corticotropin in bovine adrenocortical cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 90 | issue = 22 | pages = 10509–13 | date = Nov 1993 | pmid = 7504267 | pmc = 47806 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.90.22.10509 | bibcode = 1993PNAS...9010509R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the 12 tissues examined the highest level of expression was observed in heart, followed by brain and steroidogenic tissue samples.&lt;ref name="1993-Raikhinstein" /&gt;

As demonstrated by the effect of the trophic hormone [[ACTH]] on adrenal cortex cells, the expression of the mitochondrial genes may be strongly regulated by external factors, apparently to enhance the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins necessary for energy production.&lt;ref name="1993-Raikhinstein" /&gt; Interestingly, while the expression of protein-encoding genes was stimulated by ACTH, the levels of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA showed no significant change.&lt;ref name="1993-Raikhinstein" /&gt;

== Mitochondrial inheritance ==
In most [[metazoans|multicellular organisms]], mtDNA is inherited from the mother (maternally inherited). Mechanisms for this include simple dilution (an egg contains on average 200,000 mtDNA molecules, whereas a healthy human [[sperm]] has been reported to contain on average 5 molecules),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolff JN, Gemmell NJ | title = Lost in the zygote: the dilution of paternal mtDNA upon fertilization | journal = Heredity | volume = 101 | issue = 5 | pages = 429–34 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18685570 | doi = 10.1038/hdy.2008.74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gabriel MS, Chan SW, Alhathal N, Chen JZ, Zini A | title = Influence of microsurgical varicocelectomy on human sperm mitochondrial DNA copy number: a pilot study | journal = Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics | volume = 29 | issue = 8 | pages = 759–64 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22562241 | pmc = 3430774 | doi = 10.1007/s10815-012-9785-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; degradation of sperm mtDNA in the male genital tract and in the fertilized egg; and, at least in a few organisms, failure of sperm mtDNA to enter the egg. Whatever the mechanism, this single parent ([[uniparental inheritance]]) pattern of mtDNA inheritance is found in most animals, most plants and also in fungi.

In exceptional cases, human babies sometimes inherit mtDNA from both their fathers and their mothers resulting in mtDNA [[heteroplasmy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luo S, Valencia CA, Zhang J, Lee NC, Slone J, Gui B, Wang X, Li Z, Dell S, Brown J, Chen SM, Chien YH, Hwu WL, Fan PC, Wong LJ, Atwal PS, Huang T | title = Biparental Inheritance of Mitochondrial DNA in Humans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 115 | issue = 51 | pages = 13039–13044 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 30478036 | pmc = 6304937 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1810946115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Female inheritance ===
In [[sexual reproduction]], mitochondria are normally inherited exclusively from the mother; the mitochondria in mammalian sperm are usually destroyed by the egg cell after fertilization. Also, mitochondria are only in the sperm tail, which is used for propelling the sperm cells and sometimes the tail is lost during fertilization. In 1999 it was reported that paternal sperm mitochondria (containing mtDNA) are marked with [[ubiquitin]] to select them for later destruction inside the [[embryo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sutovsky P, Moreno RD, Ramalho-Santos J, Dominko T, Simerly C, Schatten G | title = Ubiquitin tag for sperm mitochondria | journal = Nature | volume = 402 | issue = 6760 | pages = 371–2 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10586873 | doi = 10.1038/46466 | bibcode = 1999Natur.402..371S }} Discussed in: {{cite journal |doi=10.2307/4012086 |jstor=4012086 |title=Mom's Eggs Execute Dad's Mitochondria |journal=Science News |volume=157 |issue=1 |pages=5 |year=2000 |last1=Travis |first1=John |url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/moms-eggs-execute-dads-mitochondria |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219174548/http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20000101/fob3.asp |archive-date=19 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ''[[in vitro]]'' fertilization techniques, particularly injecting a sperm into an [[oocyte]], may interfere with this.

The fact that mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited enables [[Genetic genealogy|genealogical]] researchers to trace [[Matrilineality|maternal lineage]] far back in time. ([[Y chromosome|Y-chromosomal DNA]], paternally inherited, is used in an analogous way to determine the [[patrilineal]] history.) This is usually accomplished on [[human mitochondrial DNA]] by sequencing the [[hypervariable control region]]s (HVR1 or HVR2), and sometimes the complete molecule of the mitochondrial DNA, as a [[genealogical DNA test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/wiki/en/Hiring_a_DNA_Testing_Company|title=Hiring a DNA Testing Company Genealogy | date=2016|website=Family Search|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|access-date=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; HVR1, for example, consists of about 440 base pairs. These 440 base pairs are compared to the same regions of other individuals (either specific people or subjects in a database) to determine maternal lineage. Most often, the comparison is made with the revised [[Cambridge Reference Sequence]]. Vilà ''et al.'' have published studies tracing the matrilineal descent of domestic dogs from wolves.&lt;ref name="Vila"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vilà C, Savolainen P, Maldonado JE, Amorim IR, Rice JE, Honeycutt RL, Crandall KA, Lundeberg J, Wayne RK | title = Multiple and ancient origins of the domestic dog | journal = Science | volume = 276 | issue = 5319 | pages = 1687–9 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9180076 | doi = 10.1126/science.276.5319.1687 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of the [[Mitochondrial Eve]] is based on the same type of analysis, attempting to discover the origin of [[human]]ity by tracking the lineage back in time.

=== The mitochondrial bottleneck ===
Entities subject to uniparental inheritance and with little to no recombination may be expected to be subject to [[Muller's ratchet]], the accumulation of deleterious mutations until functionality is lost. Animal populations of mitochondria avoid this through a developmental process known as the [[Heteroplasmy#Mitochondrial bottleneck|mtDNA bottleneck]]. The bottleneck exploits [[cellular noise|random processes in the cell]] to increase the cell-to-cell variability in [[heteroplasmy|mutant load]] as an organism develops: a single egg cell with some proportion of mutant mtDNA thus produces an embryo in which different cells have different mutant loads. Cell-level selection may then act to remove those cells with more mutant mtDNA, leading to a stabilisation or reduction in mutant load between generations. The mechanism underlying the bottleneck is debated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolff JN, White DJ, Woodhams M, White HE, Gemmell NJ | title = The strength and timing of the mitochondrial bottleneck in salmon suggests a conserved mechanism in vertebrates | journal = PLOS One | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = e20522 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21655224 | pmc = 3105079 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0020522 | bibcode = 2011PLoSO...620522W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cree LM, Samuels DC, de Sousa Lopes SC, Rajasimha HK, Wonnapinij P, Mann JR, Dahl HH, Chinnery PF | title = A reduction of mitochondrial DNA molecules during embryogenesis explains the rapid segregation of genotypes | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 249–54 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18223651 | doi = 10.1038/ng.2007.63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cao L, Shitara H, Horii T, Nagao Y, Imai H, Abe K, Hara T, Hayashi J, Yonekawa H | title = The mitochondrial bottleneck occurs without reduction of mtDNA content in female mouse germ cells | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 386–90 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17293866 | doi = 10.1038/ng1970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wai T, Teoli D, Shoubridge EA | title = The mitochondrial DNA genetic bottleneck results from replication of a subpopulation of genomes | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 40 | issue = 12 | pages = 1484–8 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19029901 | doi = 10.1038/ng.258 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a recent mathematical and experimental metastudy providing evidence for a combination of random partitioning of mtDNAs at cell divisions and random turnover of mtDNA molecules within the cell.&lt;ref name=pmid26035426&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnston IG, Burgstaller JP, Havlicek V, Kolbe T, Rülicke T, Brem G, Poulton J, Jones NS | title = Stochastic modelling, Bayesian inference, and new in vivo measurements elucidate the debated mtDNA bottleneck mechanism | journal = eLife | volume = 4 | issue =  | pages = e07464 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26035426 | pmc = 4486817 | doi = 10.7554/eLife.07464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Male inheritance ===

=== Mitochondrial donation ===
{{Main|Mitochondrial donation}}
An IVF technique known as mitochondrial donation or mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT) results in offspring containing mtDNA from a donor female, and nuclear DNA from the mother and father. In the spindle transfer procedure, the nucleus of an egg is inserted into the cytoplasm of an egg from a donor female which has had its nucleus removed, but still contains the donor female's mtDNA. The composite egg is then fertilized with the male's sperm. The procedure is used when a woman with [[Mitochondrial disease|genetically defective mitochondria]] wishes to procreate and produce offspring with healthy mitochondria.&lt;ref name="Frith"&gt;{{cite news |last=Frith |first=Maxine | name-list-format = vanc |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/ban-on-scientists-trying-to-create-threeparent-baby-583284.html |title=Ban on scientists trying to create three-parent baby |newspaper=The Independent |date=14 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known child to be born as a result of mitochondrial donation was a boy born to a Jordanian couple in Mexico on 6 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37485263|title=First 'three person baby' born using new method|last=Roberts|first=Michelle| name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-09-27|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept that mtDNA is particularly susceptible to [[reactive oxygen species]] generated by the [[respiratory chain]] due to its proximity remains controversial.&lt;ref name=pmid19796285&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alexeyev MF | title = Is there more to aging than mitochondrial DNA and reactive oxygen species? | journal = The FEBS Journal | volume = 276 | issue = 20 | pages = 5768–87 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19796285 | pmc = 3097520 | doi = 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07269.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; mtDNA does not accumulate any more oxidative base damage than nuclear DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anson RM, Hudson E, Bohr VA | title = Mitochondrial endogenous oxidative damage has been overestimated | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 355–60 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10657991 | doi = 10.1096/fasebj.14.2.355 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that at least some types of oxidative DNA damage are repaired more efficiently in mitochondria than they are in the nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thorslund T, Sunesen M, Bohr VA, Stevnsner T | title = Repair of 8-oxoG is slower in endogenous nuclear genes than in mitochondrial DNA and is without strand bias | journal = DNA Repair | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 261–73 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 12509245 | doi = 10.1016/S1568-7864(02)00003-4 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1260266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; mtDNA is packaged with proteins which appear to be as protective as proteins of the nuclear chromatin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guliaeva NA, Kuznetsova EA, Gaziev AI | title = [Proteins associated with mitochondrial DNA protect it against the action of X-rays and hydrogen peroxide] | language = Russian | journal = Biofizika | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages = 692–7 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16909848 | trans-title = Proteins associated with mitochondrial DNA protect it against the action of X-rays and hydrogen peroxide }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, mitochondria evolved a unique mechanism which maintains mtDNA integrity through degradation of excessively damaged genomes followed by replication of intact/repaired mtDNA.

=== Genetic illness ===
{{Further|Mitochondrial disease}}
Mutations of mitochondrial DNA can lead to a number of illnesses including [[exercise intolerance]] and [[Kearns–Sayre syndrome]] (KSS), which causes a person to lose full function of heart, eye, and muscle movements. Some evidence suggests that they might be major contributors to the aging process and [[Aging-associated diseases|age-associated pathologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alexeyev MF, Ledoux SP, Wilson GL | title = Mitochondrial DNA and aging | journal = Clinical Science | volume = 107 | issue = 4 | pages = 355–64 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15279618 | doi = 10.1042/CS20040148 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c52e27abb1cf6e2d1b5690da425435216da78aab }}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in the context of disease, the proportion of mutant mtDNA molecules in a cell is termed [[heteroplasmy]]. The within-cell and between-cell distributions of heteroplasmy dictate the onset and severity of disease &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burgstaller JP, Johnston IG, Poulton J | title = Mitochondrial DNA disease and developmental implications for reproductive strategies | journal = Molecular Human Reproduction | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–22 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25425607 | pmc = 4275042 | doi = 10.1093/molehr/gau090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are influenced by complicated [[cellular noise|stochastic processes]] within the cell and during development.&lt;ref name=pmid26035426/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burgstaller JP, Johnston IG, Jones NS, Albrechtová J, Kolbe T, Vogl C, Futschik A, Mayrhofer C, Klein D, Sabitzer S, Blattner M, Gülly C, Poulton J, Rülicke T, Piálek J, Steinborn R, Brem G | title = MtDNA segregation in heteroplasmic tissues is common in vivo and modulated by haplotype differences and developmental stage | journal = Cell Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 2031–2041 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24910436 | pmc = 4570183 | doi = 10.1016/j.celrep.2014.05.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutations in mitochondrial tRNAs can be responsible for severe diseases like the [[MELAS syndrome|MELAS]] and MERRF syndromes.&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor RW, Turnbull DM | title = Mitochondrial DNA mutations in human disease | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 389–402 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15861210 | pmc = 1762815 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1606 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutations in nuclear genes that encode proteins that mitochondria use can also contribute to mitochondrial diseases. These diseases do not follow mitochondrial inheritance patterns, but instead follow Mendelian inheritance patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Angelini C, Bello L, Spinazzi M, Ferrati C | title = Mitochondrial disorders of the nuclear genome | journal = Acta Myologica | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–23 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19772191 | pmc = 2859630 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use in disease diagnosis ===

Recently a mutation in mtDNA has been used to help diagnose prostate cancer in patients with negative [[prostate biopsy]].&lt;ref name="pmid20944788"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reguly B, Jakupciak JP, Parr RL | title = 3.4 kb mitochondrial genome deletion serves as a surrogate predictive biomarker for prostate cancer in histopathologically benign biopsy cores | journal = Canadian Urological Association Journal | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = E118-22 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20944788 | pmc = 2950771 | doi = 10.5489/cuaj.932 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20084081"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robinson K, Creed J, Reguly B, Powell C, Wittock R, Klein D, Maggrah A, Klotz L, Parr RL, Dakubo GD | title = Accurate prediction of repeat prostate biopsy outcomes by a mitochondrial DNA deletion assay | journal = Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 126–31 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20084081 | doi = 10.1038/pcan.2009.64 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with aging ===
Though the idea is controversial, some evidence suggests a link between aging and mitochondrial genome dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Aubrey |last=de Grey | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging |url=http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/MiFRA-06.pdf |isbn= 978-1-57059-564-6|year=1999 }}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, mutations in mtDNA upset a careful balance of [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) production and enzymatic ROS scavenging (by enzymes like [[superoxide dismutase]], [[catalase]], [[glutathione peroxidase]] and others). However, some mutations that increase ROS production (e.g., by reducing antioxidant defenses) in worms increase, rather than decrease, their longevity.&lt;ref name=pmid19796285/&gt; Also, [[Naked mole-rat|naked mole rats]], [[rodent]]s about the size of [[Mouse|mice]], live about eight times longer than mice despite having reduced, compared to mice, antioxidant defenses and increased oxidative damage to biomolecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lewis KN, Andziak B, Yang T, Buffenstein R | title = The naked mole-rat response to oxidative stress: just deal with it | journal = Antioxidants &amp; Redox Signaling | volume = 19 | issue = 12 | pages = 1388–99 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23025341 | pmc = 3791056 | doi = 10.1089/ars.2012.4911 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once, there was thought to be a positive feedback loop at work (a 'Vicious Cycle'); as mitochondrial DNA accumulates genetic damage caused by free radicals, the mitochondria lose function and leak free radicals into the [[cytosol]]. A decrease in mitochondrial function reduces overall metabolic efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shigenaga MK, Hagen TM, Ames BN | title = Oxidative damage and mitochondrial decay in aging | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 91 | issue = 23 | pages = 10771–8 | date = November 1994 | pmid = 7971961 | pmc = 45108 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.91.23.10771 | bibcode = 1994PNAS...9110771S | jstor = 2365473 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this concept was conclusively disproved when it was demonstrated that mice, which were genetically altered to accumulate mtDNA mutations at accelerated rate do age prematurely, but their tissues do not produce more ROS as predicted by the 'Vicious Cycle' hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trifunovic A, Hansson A, Wredenberg A, Rovio AT, Dufour E, Khvorostov I, Spelbrink JN, Wibom R, Jacobs HT, Larsson NG | title = Somatic mtDNA mutations cause aging phenotypes without affecting reactive oxygen species production | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 50 | pages = 17993–8 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16332961 | pmc = 1312403 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0508886102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..10217993T | jstor = 4152716 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting a link between longevity and mitochondrial DNA, some studies have found correlations between biochemical properties of the mitochondrial DNA and the longevity of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aledo JC, Li Y, de Magalhães JP, Ruíz-Camacho M, Pérez-Claros JA | title = Mitochondrially encoded methionine is inversely related to longevity in mammals | journal = Aging Cell | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 198–207 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21108730 | doi = 10.1111/j.1474-9726.2010.00657.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive research is being conducted to further investigate this link and methods to combat aging.

=== Neurodegenerative diseases ===

Increased mt[[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]] is a feature of several [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative diseases]].

The brains of individuals with [[Alzheimer’s disease]] have elevated levels of [[DNA oxidation|oxidative DNA damage]] in both [[nuclear DNA]] and mtDNA, but the mtDNA has approximately 10-fold higher levels than nuclear DNA.&lt;ref name="pmid15857398"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang J, Xiong S, Xie C, Markesbery WR, Lovell MA | title = Increased oxidative damage in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in Alzheimer's disease | journal = Journal of Neurochemistry | volume = 93 | issue = 4 | pages = 953–62 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15857398 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2005.03053.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;    It has been proposed that aged [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] is the critical factor in the origin of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;ref name="pmid24733654"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bonda DJ, Wang X, Lee HG, Smith MA, Perry G, Zhu X | title = Neuronal failure in Alzheimer's disease: a view through the oxidative stress looking-glass | journal = Neuroscience Bulletin | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 243–52 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24733654 | pmc = 4097013 | doi = 10.1007/s12264-013-1424-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Huntington’s disease]], mutant [[huntingtin protein]] causes mitochondria dysfunction involving inhibition of mitochondrial [[electron transport chain|electron transport]], higher levels of [[reactive oxygen species]] and increased [[oxidative stress]].&lt;ref name="pmid28785371"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu Z, Zhou T, Ziegler AC, Dimitrion P, Zuo L | title = Oxidative Stress in Neurodegenerative Diseases: From Molecular Mechanisms to Clinical Applications | journal = Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity | volume = 2017 | issue =  | pages = 2525967 | date = 2017 | pmid = 28785371 | pmc = 5529664 | doi = 10.1155/2017/2525967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mutant huntingtin protein promotes oxidative damage to mtDNA, as well as nuclear DNA, that may contribute to Huntington’s disease [[pathology]].&lt;ref name="pmid23602907"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ayala-Peña S | title = Role of oxidative DNA damage in mitochondrial dysfunction and Huntington's disease pathogenesis | journal = Free Radical Biology &amp; Medicine | volume = 62 | issue =  | pages = 102–110 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23602907 | pmc = 3722255 | doi = 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.04.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[DNA oxidation]] product [[8-oxoguanine]] (8-oxoG) is a well-established marker of oxidative DNA damage.  In persons with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), the enzymes that normally repair 8-oxoG DNA damages in the mtDNA of spinal [[motor neuron]]s are impaired.&lt;ref name="pmid11904761"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kikuchi H, Furuta A, Nishioka K, Suzuki SO, Nakabeppu Y, Iwaki T | title = Impairment of mitochondrial DNA repair enzymes against accumulation of 8-oxo-guanine in the spinal motor neurons of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis | journal = Acta Neuropathologica | volume = 103 | issue = 4 | pages = 408–14 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11904761 | doi = 10.1007/s00401-001-0480-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus oxidative damage to mtDNA of motor neurons may be a significant factor in the [[etiology]] of ALS.

=== Correlation of the mtDNA base composition with animal life spans ===
[[File:Correlation between the mtDNA GC% and maximum life span across 387 different mammalian species.png|thumb|Animal species mtDNA base composition was retrieved from the MitoAge database and compared to their maximum life span from AnAge database.]]
Over the past decade, an Israeli research group led by Professor Vadim Fraifeld has shown that strong and significant [[Correlation and dependence|correlations]] exist between the mtDNA base composition and animal species-specific maximum life spans.&lt;ref name="Lehmann et al., 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lehmann G, Budovsky A, Muradian KK, Fraifeld VE | title = Mitochondrial genome anatomy and species-specific lifespan | journal = Rejuvenation Research | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 223–6 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16706648 | doi = 10.1089/rej.2006.9.223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lehmann et al., 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lehmann G, Segal E, Muradian KK, Fraifeld VE | title = Do mitochondrial DNA and metabolic rate complement each other in determination of the mammalian maximum longevity? | journal = Rejuvenation Research | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 409–17 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18442324 | doi = 10.1089/rej.2008.0676 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lehmann et al., 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lehmann G, Muradian KK, Fraifeld VE | title = Telomere length and body temperature-independent determinants of mammalian longevity? | journal = Frontiers in Genetics | volume = 4 | issue = 111 | pages = 111 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23781235 | pmc = 3680702 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2013.00111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As demonstrated in their work, higher mtDNA [[guanine]] + [[cytosine]] content ([[GC-content|GC%]]) strongly associates with longer [[maximum life span]]s across animal species. An additional observation is that the mtDNA GC% correlation with the maximum life spans is independent of the well-known correlation between animal species metabolic rate and maximum life spans. The mtDNA GC% and resting metabolic rate explain the differences in animal species maximum life spans in a multiplicative manner (i.e., species maximum life span = their mtDNA GC% * metabolic rate).&lt;ref name="Lehmann et al., 2008"/&gt; To support the scientific community in carrying out comparative analyses between mtDNA features and longevity across animals, a dedicated database was built named [http://www.mitoage.info/ MitoAge].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Toren D, Barzilay T, Tacutu R, Lehmann G, Muradian KK, Fraifeld VE | title = MitoAge: a database for comparative analysis of mitochondrial DNA, with a special focus on animal longevity | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 44 | issue = D1 | pages = D1262-5 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26590258 | pmc = 4702847 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkv1187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with non-B (non-canonical) DNA structures ===
Deletion breakpoints frequently occur within or near regions showing non-canonical (non-B) conformations, namely hairpins, cruciforms and cloverleaf-like elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Damas J, Carneiro J, Gonçalves J, Stewart JB, Samuels DC, Amorim A, Pereira F | title = Mitochondrial DNA deletions are associated with non-B DNA conformations | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 40 | issue = 16 | pages = 7606–21 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22661583 | pmc = 3439893 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gks500 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, there is data supporting the involvement of helix-distorting intrinsically curved regions and long G-tetrads in eliciting instability events.

== Use in forensics ==
{{for|use in human identification|Human mitochondrial DNA}}
Unlike nuclear DNA, which is inherited from both parents and in which genes are rearranged in the process of [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], there is usually no change in mtDNA from parent to offspring. Although mtDNA also recombines, it does so with copies of itself within the same mitochondrion. Because of this and because the [[mutation rate]] of animal mtDNA is higher than that of nuclear DNA,&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown WM, George M, Wilson AC | title = Rapid evolution of animal mitochondrial DNA | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 76 | issue = 4 | pages = 1967–71 | date = April 1979 | pmid = 109836 | pmc = 383514 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.76.4.1967 | bibcode = 1979PNAS...76.1967B | jstor = 69636 }}&lt;/ref&gt; mtDNA is a powerful tool for tracking ancestry through females ([[matrilineage]]) and has been used in this role to track the ancestry of many species back hundreds of generations.

The rapid mutation rate (in animals) makes mtDNA useful for assessing genetic relationships of individuals or groups within a species and also for identifying and quantifying the phylogeny (evolutionary relationships; see [[phylogenetics]]) among different species. To do this, biologists determine and then compare the mtDNA sequences from different individuals or species. Data from the comparisons is used to construct a network of relationships among the sequences, which provides an estimate of the relationships among the individuals or species from which the mtDNAs were taken. mtDNA can be used to estimate the relationship between both closely related and distantly related species. Due to the high mutation rate of mtDNA in animals, the 3rd positions of the codons change relatively rapidly, and thus provide information about the genetic distances among closely related individuals or species. On the other hand, the substitution rate of mt-proteins is very low, thus amino acid changes accumulate slowly (with corresponding slow changes at 1st and 2nd codon positions) and thus they provide information about the genetic distances of distantly related species. Statistical models that treat substitution rates among codon positions separately, can thus be used to simultaneously estimate phylogenies that contain both closely and distantly related species&lt;ref name="nature"/&gt;

== Use in evolutionary biology and systematic biology ==
mtDNA is conserved across eukaryotic organism given the critical role of mitochondria in [[cellular respiration]]. However, due to less efficient DNA repair (compared to nuclear DNA) it has a relatively high mutation rate (but slow compared to other DNA regions such as [[microsatellite]]s) which makes it useful for studying the evolutionary relationships—[[phylogeny]]—of organisms. Biologists can determine and then compare mtDNA sequences among different species and use the comparisons to build an [[evolutionary tree]] for the species examined.

For instance, while most [[Nuclear gene|nuclear genes]] are nearly identical between humans and [[Chimpanzee|chimpanzees]], their mitochondrial genomes are 9.8% different. Human and [[Western gorilla|gorilla]] mitochondrial genomes are 11.8% different, showing that we are more closely related to chimps than gorillas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xu|first=X.|last2=Arnason|first2=U.|date=1996-05-01|title=A complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome of the western lowland gorilla.|url=https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/13/5/691/1083040|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|language=en|volume=13|issue=5|pages=691–698|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025630|pmid=8676744|issn=0737-4038|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Mitochondrial DNA was discovered in the 1960s by Margit M. K. Nass and Sylvan Nass by [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]] as DNase-sensitive threads inside mitochondria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nass MM, Nass S | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 593–611 | date = December 1963 | pmid = 14086138 | pmc = 2106331 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.19.3.593 | title = INTRAMITOCHONDRIAL FIBERS WITH DNA CHARACTERISTICS: I. Fixation and Electron Staining Reactions }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Ellen Haslbrunner, [[Hans Tuppy]] and [[Gottfried Schatz]] by biochemical assays on highly purified mitochondrial fractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schatz G, Haslbrunner E, Tuppy H | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–32 | date = March 1964 | pmid = 26410904 | doi = 10.1016/0006-291X(64)90311-0 | title = Deoxyribonucleic acid associated with yeast mitochondria }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mitochondrial sequence databases ==

== Mitochondrial mutation databases ==
Several specialized databases exist that report polymorphisms and mutations in the human mitochondrial DNA, together with the assessment of their pathogenicity.

* '''MitImpact''': A collection of pre-computed pathogenicity predictions for all nucleotide changes that cause non-synonymous substitutions in human mitochondrial protein coding genes [http://mitimpact.css-mendel.it/].
* '''MITOMAP''': A compendium of polymorphisms and mutations in human mitochondrial DNA [http://www.mitomap.org/MITOMAP].
