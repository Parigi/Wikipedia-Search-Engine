'''Hollywood Boulevard''' is a major east–west street in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. It begins in the west as a winding residential street at Sunset Plaza Drive in the [[Hollywood Hills West, Los Angeles|Hollywood Hills West]] district. After crossing [[Laurel Canyon Boulevard]], it proceeds due east as a major thoroughfare through [[Hollywood]], [[Little Armenia, Los Angeles, California|Little Armenia]] and [[Thai Town, Los Angeles, California|Thai Town]] to [[Vermont Avenue]]. It then runs southeast to its eastern terminus at Sunset Boulevard in the [[Los Feliz, Los Angeles|Los Feliz]] district. Parts of the boulevard are popular tourist destinations, primarily the fifteen blocks between [[La Brea Avenue]] east to [[Gower Street (Hollywood)|Gower Street]] where the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] is primarily located.

== History ==
Hollywood Boulevard was originally named Prospect Avenue until 1910, when the town of [[Hollywood]], created by [[H.J. Whitley]], was annexed by the neighboring [[Los Angeles|city of Los Angeles]]. After annexation, the street numbers changed from 100 Prospect Avenue, at Vermont Avenue, to 6400 Hollywood Boulevard.

In the early 1920s, real estate developer [[Charles E. Toberman]] (the "Father of Hollywood") envisioned a thriving [[Hollywood]] theatre district.&lt;ref name="LAThenandNow"&gt;{{cite book |title=Los Angeles: Then and Now |last=Lord |first=Rosemary |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Thunder Bay Press |location=San Diego, CA |isbn=1-57145-794-1 |oclc= |page= |pages=90–91 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toberman was involved in 36 projects while building the Max Factor Building, [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]] and  the [[Hollywood Masonic Temple]]. With [[Sid Grauman]], he opened the three themed theatres: [[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre|Egyptian]], [[El Capitan Theatre|El Capitan]] ("The Captain") (1926), and [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre|Chinese]].&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vaughn|first1=Susan|title=El Capitan Courageous|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/03/business/fi-24804|accessdate=September 7, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 3, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, [[Gene Autry]], while riding his horse in the [[Hollywood Christmas Parade]] — which passes down Hollywood Boulevard each year on the Sunday after [[Thanksgiving]] — heard young parade watchers yelling, "Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus!" and was inspired to write "[[Here Comes Santa Claus]]" with [[Oakley Haldeman]].&lt;ref&gt;"Home – The Hollywood Christmas Parade." The Hollywood Christmas Parade. N.p., n.d. Web. 23 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], which runs from [[La Brea Avenue]] east to [[Gower Street (Hollywood)|Gower Street]] (and an additional three blocks on [[Vine Street]]), was created as a tribute to artists working in the entertainment industry.

In the 1970's, the street became very seedy and was frequented by many odd characters as shown in pictures by photographer Ave Pildas.&lt;ref name="Ave Pildas"&gt;{{cite web |last1=MacLaren |first1=Becca |title=The Seedy, Funky, and Fabulous Hollywood Boulevard of the 1970s |url=https://blogs.getty.edu/iris/the-seedy-funky-and-fabulous-hollywood-boulevard-1970s/ |website=The Getty Iris |publisher=The Getty |accessdate=23 January 2020 |date=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, a portion of Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood was listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as part of the "Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District".

In 1992, the street was paved with glittery asphalt between Vine Street and La Brea Boulevard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krikorian|first1=Greg|title=Hollywood Blvd. to Be Paved With Glitz|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-05/local/me-5893_1_hollywood-boulevard |accessdate=December 12, 2018|work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 5, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[El Capitan Theatre]] was refurbished in 1991 then damaged in the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]]. The full El Capitan building was fully restored and upgraded in {{dts|1997|12}}. The Hollywood Entertainment District, a self-taxing business improvement district, was formed for the properties from La Brea to McCadden on the boulevard.&lt;ref name=lat /&gt;

The Hollywood extension of the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|Metro]] [[Red Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Red Line]] [[Rapid transit|subway]] was opened in June 1999, running from [[Downtown Los Angeles]] to the [[San Fernando Valley]].  Stops on Hollywood Boulevard are located at [[Hollywood/Western (LACMTA station)|Western Avenue]], [[Hollywood/Vine (LACMTA station)|Vine Street]], and [[Hollywood/Highland (LACMTA station)|Highland Avenue]]. [[Metro Local]] lines 180, 181, and 217, and [[Metro Rapid]] line 780 also serve Hollywood Boulevard. An [[Cruising (driving around)|anti-cruising]] ordinance prohibits driving on parts of the boulevard more than twice in four hours.&lt;ref&gt;Martin H and McCormack S (September 24, 1999): Idled by the Law : As Cities Crack Down on Cruising, Car Culture Aficionados Find Other Outlets. [https://articles.latimes.com/1999/sep/24/local/me-13540 Los Angeles ''Times'' archive]. Retrieved March 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1995, then [[Los Angeles City Council]] member [[Jackie Goldberg]] initiated efforts to clean up Hollywood Boulevard and reverse its decades-long slide into disrepute.&lt;ref name=iht /&gt; Central to these efforts was the construction of the [[Hollywood and Highland Center]] and adjacent [[Dolby Theatre]] (originally known as the Kodak Theater) in 2001.

=== Revitalization ===
In early 2006, the city made revamping plans on Hollywood Boulevard for future tourists. The three-part plan was to exchange the original streetlights with red stars into two-headed old-fashioned streetlights, put in new palm trees, and put in new stoplights. The renovations were completed in late 2006.

In the few years leading up to 2007, more than $2 billion was spent on projects in the neighborhood, including mixed-use retail and apartment complexes and new schools and museums.&lt;ref name=iht&gt;{{cite news|title=Development at Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street spurs Tinseltown renaissance|newspaper=International Herald Tribune|authorlink=Jennifer Steinhauer|first=Jennifer |last=Steinhauer|date=January 26, 2007|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/26/news/hollywood.php|accessdate=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates promote the idea of closing Hollywood Boulevard to traffic and create a [[Pedestrian zone]] from La Brea Avenue to Highland Avenue citing an increase in pedestrian traffic including tourism, weekly movie premiers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onlyinhollywood.org/alerts/|title=Alerts Archive|website=Only In Hollywood|language=en|access-date=2020-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and award shows closures, including 10 days for the Academy Award ceremony at the Dolby Theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://la.curbed.com/2018/3/2/17072092/hollywood-boulevard-close-cars-oscars|title=Make the Oscars street closures permanent|first=Alissa|last=Walker|date=2 March 2018|website=Curbed LA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to other cities in the US, like [[Third Street Promenade]], [[Fremont Street]] in Las Vegas, [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market St.]] in San Francisco or the closure in [[Times Square]]s [[Times Square#Pedestrian plaza|Pedestrian Plaza's]] created in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/opinion/livable-city/la-ol-hollywood-scramble-star-wars-20151230-story.html|title=Opinion: Here's a New Year's resolution worth keeping: Close Hollywood Boulevard to cars in 2016|last=Crotty|first=Emilia|date=2015-12-30|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2019, The City of Los Angeles commissioned [[Gensler]] architects to provide a master plan for a $4 million dollar renovation to improve and "update the streetscape concept" for the Walk of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://urbanize.la/post/hollywood-walk-fames-4-million-master-plan-moves-forward|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame's $4-Million Master Plan Moves Forward|date=2019-06-14|website=Urbanize LA|language=en|access-date=2020-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/city-selects-firm-to-design-hollywood-walk-of-fame-improvements/135152/|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame Update Coming, City Selects Firm to Design Improvements|website=NBC Los Angeles|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-30/hollywood-boulevard-highland-vine-road-diet-traffic|title=L.A. considers bold makeover for Hollywood Boulevard: Fewer cars, bike lanes, wider sidewalks|last=Nelson|first=Laura J.|last2=Vega|first2=Priscella|date=2020-01-30|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Los Angeles City Councilmember Mitch O’Farrell released the draft master plan designed by Gensler and Studio-MLA in January 2020. It proposed widening the sidewalks, adding bike lanes, new landscaping, sidewalk dining, removing lanes of car traffic and street parking between the [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|Pantages Theater]] (Argyle Avenue) at the east and [[The Emerson Theatre]] (La Brea Avenue) at the west end of the boulevard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://la.curbed.com/2020/1/31/21115464/hollywood-boulevard-walk-of-fame-pedestrian-friendly|title=‘Exciting’ Hollywood Boulevard makeover unveiled.

== Events ==
A popular event that takes place on the Boulevard is the complete transformation of the street to a [[Christmas]] theme.  Shops and department stores attract customers by lighting their stores and the entire street with decorated Christmas trees and Christmas lights.  The street essentially becomes "Santa Claus Lane."&lt;ref&gt;Masters, Nathan.
