'''''Much Ado About Nothing''''' is a 2012 black and white American [[romantic comedy]] film adapted for the screen, produced, and directed by [[Joss Whedon]], from [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Much Ado About Nothing|play of the same name]]. The film stars [[Amy Acker]], [[Alexis Denisof]], [[Nathan Fillion]], [[Clark Gregg]], [[Reed Diamond]], [[Fran Kranz]], [[Sean Maher]], and [[Jillian Morgese]].

To create the film, director Whedon established the production studio [[Bellwether Pictures]]. The film premiered at the 2012 [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and had its North American theatrical release on June 21, 2013.

==Plot==
The plot of the film is largely unchanged from that of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Much Ado About Nothing|original play]]. Differences include the modern-day setting, switching Conrade's gender, eliminating several minor roles and consolidating others into Leonato's aide, and expanding Ursula's role by giving her a number of Margaret's scenes.  In addition, the film attempts to add background to the relationship between Beatrice and Benedick by showing, in an opening scene, a morning after they apparently slept together. Benedick steals away quietly while Beatrice pretends to be asleep.

==Cast==
* [[Amy Acker]] as Beatrice, niece of Leonato.
* [[Alexis Denisof]] as Benedick, of Padua; companion of Don Pedro.
* [[Reed Diamond]] as [[Don Pedro (Shakespeare character)|Don Pedro]], Prince of Aragon.
* [[Nathan Fillion]] as [[Dogberry]], the constable in charge of Messina's night watch.
* [[Clark Gregg]] as Leonato, governor of Messina; Hero's father.
* [[Fran Kranz]] as Claudio, of Florence; a count, companion of Don Pedro, friend to Benedick.
* [[Sean Maher]] as Don John, "the Bastard Prince," brother of Don Pedro.
* [[Jillian Morgese]] as Hero, Leonato's daughter.
* [[Spencer Treat Clark]] as Borachio, follower of Don John.
* [[Riki Lindhome]] as Conrade, lover of Don John (originally, follower of Don John, a male role).
* [[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]] as Margaret, waiting-gentlewoman attendant on Hero.
* Emma Bates as Ursula, waiting-gentlewoman attendant on Hero.
* [[Tom Lenk]] as Verges, the Headborough, Dogberry's partner
* [[BriTANicK|Nick Kocher]] as First watchman
* [[BriTANicK|Brian McElhaney]] as Second watchman
* Joshua Zar as Leonato's aide
* Paul M. Meston as Friar Francis, a priest.
* [[Romy Rosemont]] as The Sexton, the district attorney at Borachio and Conrade's interrogation (originally, the judge of the trial of Borachio, a male role).

[[Anthony Head]] was originally intended for the role of Leonato, but was unavailable.&lt;ref name="EW.com" /&gt; Clark Gregg had worked with Whedon on ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' at the time, and stepped in to play the part.&lt;ref name="BADHAVEN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badhaven.com/film/film-news/joss-whedon-talks-much-ado-about-nothing/|title=Joss Whedon talks Much Ado About Nothing|publisher=badhaven.com|accessdate=December 8, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190805/http://www.badhaven.com/film/film-news/joss-whedon-talks-much-ado-about-nothing/|archivedate=October 29, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the cast had worked with Whedon before; Acker and Denisof on ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''; Denisof, Fillion, Lenk and Lindhome on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''; Fillion and Maher on ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]''; Acker, Denisof, Diamond, Kranz and Johnson on ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]''; Gregg, Denisof, Rosemont, Johnson and Morgese in ''The Avengers''.&lt;ref name="Digital Spy."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/at-the-movies/a464250/joss-whedons-much-ado-actors-where-you-know-them-from.html|title=Joss Whedon's 'Much Ado' actors: Where you know them from|first=Emma|last=Dibdin|date=June 11, 2013|publisher=digitalspy.co.uk|accessdate=March 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THE Hollywood REPORTER; cast"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/joss-whedon-whedonverse-cult-hero-avengers-buffy-firefly-314554|title=Exploring the Whedonverse: Inside the Cult Hero Fame of 'Avengers' Director Joss Whedon|first=Jordan|last=Zakarin|date=April 24, 2012|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=March 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Itzkoff |title=How Shakespeare Saved 'Avengers' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/movies/joss-whedon-on-his-much-ado-about-nothing.html |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=24 May 2013 |accessdate=29 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whedon explained his initial interest in the project, saying:

{{quote|I fixated on this notion that our ideas of romantic love are created for us by the society around us, and then escape from that is grown-up love, is marriage, is mature love, to escape the ideals of love that we're supposed to follow.&lt;ref name="EW.com" /&gt;}}

He elaborated on that sentiment, and said "It's a very cynically romantic text about love, and how we behave, and how we're expected to behave. It's a party, but there's something darker there as well". Inspired by the exposing nature of [[Filmmaking|film]], Whedon decided to infuse a recurring motif of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], "...because it's a visual medium. You can say it or you can show it. ... There's an element to it, of debauchery, that was fun for a time but then it was just sort of dark".&lt;ref name="Leaky NEWS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leakynews.com/much-ado-about-nothing-qa/|title=SXSW Film: Much Ado About Nothing Q&amp;A|date=March 9, 2013|publisher=leakynews.com|accessdate=March 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814233710/http://www.leakynews.com/much-ado-about-nothing-qa/|archive-date=August 14, 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whedon's idea to adapt the play for the screen originated from having "Shakespeare readings" at his house with several of his friends, years prior.&lt;ref name="VULTURE"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2013/06/joss-whedon-much-ado-about-nothing-interview.html|title=Joss Whedon on Much Ado About Nothing, Shakespeare-Buffy Parallels, and Avengers 2|first=Jennifer|last=Vineyard|date=June 7, 2013|publisher=vulture.com|accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whedon and his [[director of photography]] Jay Hunter took advantage of [[Sunlight|natural lighting]] in order to make it feel "very found", noting, "Our lighting package rose in the east and set in the west".&lt;ref name="THE SKINNY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/latest/304769-joss_whedon_much_ado_about_nothing|title=Joss Whedon on Much Ado About Nothing|first=Kirsty|last=Leckie-Palmer|date=June 4, 2013|publisher=theskinny.co.uk|accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[mirror]]s, [[glass]] and [[window]]s to shoot through, he explains, "[It's] something I'd like to do all the time, but particularly in a movie that's all about lies, and manipulation and misunderstandings. The more you can warp the frame a little bit, the more it speaks towards what's going on".&lt;ref name="THE SKINNY" /&gt; The film was shot hand-held, [[Digital video|digitally]] with multiple cameras, often with a [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|RED Epic]], and used a [[Lensbaby]] [[Lensbaby#Composer|Composer with Double Glass]] lens on a [[Canon EOS 7D|Canon 7D]] to differentiate certain scenes.&lt;ref name="LENSBABY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lensbaby.com/blog/film-video/pro-spotlight-jay-hunter/|title=FILM &amp; VIDEO: Jay Hunter|first=Keri|last=Friedman|date=June 3, 2013|publisher=lensbaby.com|accessdate=June 8, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202002550/http://lensbaby.com/blog/film-video/pro-spotlight-jay-hunter/|archivedate=February 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
