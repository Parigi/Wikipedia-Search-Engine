==Personal life==

==Career==
Schnauz started his career in various production jobs. His first screenplay was called "[[Spirits in Passing]]". He eventually joined Vince Gilligan on the writing staffs of ''[[The X-Files]]'' and its spinoff show, ''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|The Lone Gunmen]]''.&lt;ref name=WritersRoom /&gt; He also co-wrote the screenplays for the 2008 film ''[[Otis (film)|Otis]]'' and the 2008 television film ''[[Infected (2008 film)|Infected]]''. In 2010, he re-teamed with Gilligan on ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', where he remained through the show's 2013 conclusion.

Schnauz signed a two-year overall deal with [[Sony Pictures Television]] in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2014/01/breaking-bads-tom-schnauz-inks-overall-deal-with-sony-tv-joins-better-call-saul-660785/|title=‘Breaking Bad’s Tom Schnauz Inks Overall Deal With Sony TV, Joins ‘Better Call Saul’|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=2014-01-09|work=Deadline|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Schnauz serves as co-executive producer on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]'s ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' spinoff series ''[[Better Call Saul]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/breaking-bad-writers-join-better-call-saul-staff-1200981189/ |title=‘Breaking Bad’ Writers Join ‘Better Call Saul’ Staff |last=Littleton |first=Cynthia |work=Variety |date=December 20, 2013 |accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has written and/or directed a number of its episodes including [[Pimento (Better Call Saul)|"Pimento"]], the penultimate episode of the show's first season, which received critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowman|first1=Donna|title=Better Call Saul: 'Pimento'|url=https://www.avclub.com/tvclub/better-call-saul-pimento-217233|accessdate=26 April 2015|work=The A.V.

In April 2015, it was reported that he had been tapped to write the screenplay for "a revisionist take" on [[Jack and the Beanstalk]], also to be produced by Vince Gilligan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fleming Jr.|first1=Mike|title=Disney, ' Breaking Bad' Creator Vince Gilligan Taking Another Whack At Jack And The Beanstalk|url=https://deadline.com/2015/04/breaking-bad-vince-gilligan-jack-and-the-beanstalk-1201414639|website=Deadline Hollywood | date=22 April 2015 | accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, Schnauz joined other WGA writers in firing their agents as part of the [[Writers Guild of America|WGA's]] stand against the [[Association of Talent Agents|ATA]] and the unfair practice of [[Movie packaging|packaging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Patton Oswalt, David Simon, Danny Zuker, More WGA Members Post Termination Letters |url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/wga-members-termination-letters-1203189062/ |publisher=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;
