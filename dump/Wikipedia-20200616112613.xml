[[Apple Inc.]], formerly Apple Computer, Inc., is a [[multinational corporation]] that creates [[consumer electronics]], [[personal computer]]s, [[server (computing)|server]]s, and computer software, and is a [[digital distribution|digital distributor]] of media content. The company also has a chain of retail stores known as [[Apple Stores]]. Apple's core product lines are the [[iPhone]] [[smartphone]], [[iPad]] [[tablet computer]], [[iPod]] [[portable media player]]s, and [[Macintosh]] computer line. Founders [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Steve Wozniak]] created Apple Computer on April 1, 1976,&lt;ref name="partnership"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downloads.reactivemicro.com/Public/Apple%20II%20Items/Documentation/Apple%20Info/Apple%20PartnerShip%20Agreement.pdf|title=Apple Computer Company Partnership Agreement|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328214907/https://downloads.reactivemicro.com/Apple%20II%20Items/Documentation/Apple%20Info/Apple%20PartnerShip%20Agreement.pdf|archive-date=March 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporated the company on January 3, 1977,&lt;ref name="Apple incorporation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.apple.com/faq.cfm?FaqSetID=6|title=Apple Investor Relations FAQ|publisher=Apple Inc|accessdate=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Cupertino, California]].

For more than three decades, Apple Computer was predominantly a manufacturer of personal computers, including the [[Apple II]], [[Macintosh]], and [[Power Mac]] lines, but it faced rocky sales and low market share during the 1990s. Jobs, who had been ousted from the company in 1985, returned to Apple in 1996 after his company [[NeXT]] was bought by Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple Computer, Inc.

With the introduction of the successful [[iPod]] music player in 2001 and [[iTunes Store|iTunes Music Store]] in 2003, Apple established itself as a leader in the consumer electronics and media sales industries, leading it to drop "Computer" from the company's name in 2007. The company is now also known for its [[iOS]] range of smart phone, media player, and tablet computer products that began with the [[iPhone]], followed by the [[iPod Touch]] and then [[iPad]]. {{As of|2015|6|30}}, Apple was [[List of corporations by market capitalization|the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/3738dd34-35da-11e5-b05b-b01debd57852.xls ''Financial Times'']&lt;/ref&gt; with an estimated value of US$1 trillion as of August 2, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45050213|title=AApple is first public company worth $1 trillion|last=|first=|date=2018-08-02|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple's worldwide annual revenue in 2010 totaled US$65 billion, growing to US$127.8 billion in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldman |first=David |url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/29/technology/apple_market_cap/index.htm |title=At $500 billion, Apple is worth more than Poland – Feb. 29, 2012 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=February 29, 2012 |accessdate=September 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $156 billion in 2012.&lt;ref name="10-K-2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000119312512444068/d411355d10k.htm |title=2012 Apple Form 10-K |date= October 31, 2012|accessdate=November 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-foundation ===
[[file:Blue Box in museum.jpg|thumb|[[Steve Wozniak]]'s "[[blue box]]" at the [[Computer History Museum]].]]
[[Steve Jobs]] and [[Steve Wozniak]] first met in mid-1971, when their mutual friend, [[Bill Fernandez]], introduced then 21-year-old Wozniak to 16-year-old Jobs.{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=1–2}}{{sfn|O'Grady|2009|pages=1–2}} Their first business partnership began later that year when Wozniak, a self-educated electronics engineer, started to build his original “[[blue box]]es” that enabled one to make long-distance [[Phreaking|phone calls at no cost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |ref={{harvid|Isaacson|2011}} |first=Walter |last=Isaacson |year=2011 |title=Steve Jobs |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781451648546 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa }} pp. 27–29&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs managed to sell some two hundred blue boxes for $150 each, and split the profit with Wozniak.{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=1–2}}{{sfn|O'Grady|2009|pages=1–2}} Jobs later told his biographer that if it hadn't been for Wozniak's blue boxes, "there wouldn't have been an Apple."{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=30}}

Jobs and Wozniak, also referred to collectively as "the two Steves", had withdrawn from [[Reed College]] and [[UC Berkeley]] respectively by 1975. Wozniak designed a video terminal that he could use to log on to the minicomputers at Call Computer. Alex Kamradt commissioned the design and sold a small number of them through his firm. Aside from their interest in up-to-date technology, the impetus for the two Steves seems to have had another source. In his essay ''From Satori to Silicon Valley'' (published 1986), cultural historian [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]] made the point that the Apple Computer emerged from within the West Coast [[counterculture]] and the need to produce print-outs, letter labels, and databases. Roszak offers a bit of background on the development of the two Steves' prototype models.

In 1975, the two Steves started attending meetings of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]].&lt;ref name="Apple Confidential"&gt;{{Cite book |ref={{harvid|Linzmayer|2004}}|first=Owen W. |last=Linzmayer |year=2004 |title=Apple Confidential 2.0: The Definitive History of the World's Most Colorful Company |publisher=No Starch Press |isbn=9781593270100}} pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; New microcomputers such as the [[Altair 8800]] and the [[IMSAI]] inspired Wozniak to build a microprocessor into his video terminal and have a complete computer. At the time the only [[microcomputer]] [[Central processing unit|CPUs]] generally available were the $179 [[Intel 8080]] ({{Inflation|US|179|1975|fmt=eq}}), and the $170 [[Motorola 6800]] ({{Inflation|US|170|1975|fmt=eq}}). Wozniak preferred the 6800, but both were out of his price range. So he watched, and learned, and designed computers on paper, waiting for the day he could afford a CPU.

When [[MOS Technology]] released its $20 ({{Inflation|US|20|1976|fmt=eq}}) [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] chip in 1976, Wozniak wrote a version of [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] for it, then began to design a computer for it to run on. The 6502 was designed by the same people who designed the 6800, as many in Silicon Valley left employers to form their own companies. Wozniak's earlier 6800 paper-computer needed only minor changes to run on the new chip.

By March 1, 1976, Wozniak completed the machine and took it to a [[Homebrew Computer Club]] meeting to show it off.{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|page=5}} When Jobs saw Wozniak's computer, which would later become known as the [[Apple I]], he was immediately interested in its commercial potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref={{harvid|O'Grady|2009}}| author=Jason D. O'Grady |year=2009 |title=Apple Inc. |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9780313362446}} p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Wozniak intended to share schematics of the machine for free, but Jobs insisted that they should instead build and sell bare [[printed circuit board]]s for the computer.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|page=62}} Wozniak also originally offered the design to [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP), where he worked at the time, but was denied by the company on five different occasions.&lt;ref name="AI"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://appleinsider.com/articles/10/12/06/apple_co_founder_offered_first_computer_design_to_hp_5_times |title=Apple co-founder offered first computer design to HP 5 times |publisher=[[AppleInsider]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs eventually convinced Wozniak to go into business together and start a new company of their own.{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=5–6}} In order to raise the money they needed to produce the first batch of printed circuit boards, Jobs sold his [[Volkswagen Type 2]] [[minibus]] for a few hundred dollars, and Wozniak sold his [[HP-65]] [[programmable calculator]] for $500.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|page=62}}{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|page=5}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref={{harvid|Schlender|2016}}|title=Becoming Steve Jobs: The Evolution of a Reckless Upstart into a Visionary Leader|first1=Brent |last1=Schlender |first2=Rick |last2=Tetzeli|date=2016 |publisher=Crown Business; Reprint edition|isbn=9780385347426}} pp.37–39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref={{harvid|Wozniak|2007}} |last= Wozniak |first= Steve |last2= Smith |first2= Gina |author2link= Gina Smith (author) |year= 2007 |title= iWoz: Computer Geek to Cult Icon |publisher=[[W.

}}
On April 1, 1976, Apple Computer Company was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and [[Ronald Wayne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rhiannon |last=Williams |title=Apple celebrates 39th year on April 1 |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/11507451/Apple-celebrates-39th-year-on-April-1.html |website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date=April 1, 2015 |accessdate=July 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=5–6}} The company was registered as a California [[business partnership]].{{sfn|Schlender|2016|page=39}}
Wayne, who worked at [[Atari]] as a chief draftsman, agreed to become a co-founder of the company in return for a 10% stake.{{sfn|Swaine|2014|pages=336–338}}{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=5–6}}&lt;ref name="partnership"/&gt; However, Wayne was somewhat gun-shy due to the failure of his own venture four years earlier. On April 12, less than two weeks after the company's formation, Wayne left Apple, selling his 10% share back to the two Steves for only $800 and leaving them as the active primary co-founders.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|pages=65–66}}{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=6–8}}

According to Wozniak, Jobs proposed the name “Apple Computer” when he had just come back from [[Robert Friedland]]’s All-One Farm in Oregon.{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=6–8}} Jobs told [[Walter Isaacson]] that he was "on one of my fruitarian diets," when he conceived of the name and thought "it sounded fun, spirited and not intimidating ... plus, it would get us ahead of Atari in the phone book."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |ref={{harvid|Isaacson|2015}} |first=Walter |last=Isaacson |year=2015 |title=Steve Jobs |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781501127625}} p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the company was formed, the two Steves made one last trip to the Homebrew Computer Club and demonstrated the finished version of the [[Apple I]].{{sfn|Schlender|2016|pages=39–40}} [[Paul Terrell]], who operated a computer store chain named the ''Byte Shop'', was in attendance, and became impressed with the machine.{{sfn|Swaine|2014|pages=336–338}} He handed the two Steves his card, and told them to "keep in touch."{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|page=66}} The following day, Jobs dropped in on Terrell at the Byte Shop store in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], and tried to sell him the bare circuit boards for the Apple I.{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=6–8}} Terrell told Jobs that he was interested in purchasing the machine, but only if it came fully assembled, saying he would order 50 assembled computers and pay US$500 each on delivery ({{Inflation|US|500|1976|fmt=eq|r=-2}}).&lt;ref name="iCon-p35"&gt;{{cite book| title=iCon Steve Jobs: The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business| last=Young| first=Jeffrey| author2=William L.

The local credit manager asked Jobs how he was going to pay for the parts and he replied, "I have this purchase order from the Byte Shop chain of computer stores for 50 of my computers and the payment terms are [[Cash on delivery|COD]]. If you give me the parts on net 30-day terms I can build and deliver the computers in that time frame, collect my money from Terrell at the Byte Shop and pay you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=iWoz: The Autobiography of the Man Who Started the Computer Revolution|author1=Steve Wozniak|author2=Gina Smith|isbn=978-0-7553-1408-9|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wozniak198412"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-12/1984_12_BYTE_09-13_Communications#page/n461/mode/2up | title=The Apple Story / Part 1: Early History | work=BYTE | date=December 1984 | accessdate=October 23, 2013 |author1=Williams, Gregg |author2=Moore, Rob | pages=A67 | type=interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The credit manager called Paul Terrell, who was attending an IEEE computer conference at Asilomar in Pacific Grove and verified the validity of the purchase order. Amazed at the tenacity of Jobs, Terrell assured the credit manager if the computers showed up in his stores, Jobs would be paid and would have more than enough money to pay for the parts order. The two Steves and their small crew spent day and night building and testing the computers, and delivered to Terrell on time to pay his suppliers. Terrell was surprised when Jobs delivered him a batch of assembled circuit boards, as he had expected complete computers with a case, monitor and keyboard.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|pages=67–68}}{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=8–10}} Nonetheless, Terrell kept his word and paid the two Steves the money he had promised them.&lt;ref name=VintageNews/&gt;{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|pages=67–68}}{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=8–10}}&lt;ref name="iCon-p36"&gt;{{cite book| title=iCon Steve Jobs: The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business| last=Young| first=Jeffrey| author2=William L.

The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 as an assembled circuit board with a retail price of $666.66.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7091190.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |title=Building the digital age |access-date=November 24, 2019 |date=November 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=7–8}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|pages=69–70}} Wozniak later said he had no idea about the relation between the number and the [[mark of the beast]], and that he came up with the price because he liked "repeating digits".&lt;ref name=VintageNews&gt;{{cite news |first=Goran |last=Blazeski |title=Apple-1, Steve Wozniak’s hand-built creation, was Apple’s first official product, priced at $666.66 |url= https://www.thevintagenews.com/2017/11/25/apples-first-official-product-was-priced-at-666-66/ |website=The Vintage News |date=November 25, 2017 |accessdate=November 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, about 200 units of the Apple I were sold.{{sfn|Linzmayer|page=14}}

The Apple I computer had a few notable features. One was the use of a [[Television|TV]] as the display system, whereas many machines had no display at all. This was not like the displays of later machines, however; the text was displayed at 60 characters per second. However, this was still faster than the teleprinters used on contemporary machines of that era. The Apple I also included [[booting|bootstrap]] code on [[Read-only memory|ROM]], which made it easier to start up. Finally, at the insistence of Paul Terrell, Wozniak also designed a cassette interface for loading and saving programs, at the then-rapid pace of 1200&amp;nbsp;bit/s. Although the machine was fairly simple, it was nevertheless a masterpiece of design, using far fewer parts than anything in its class, and quickly earning Wozniak a reputation as a master designer.

Encouraged by the success of the Apple I, Jobs started looking for investments to further expand the business,{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=8–10}} but banks were reluctant to lend him money; the idea of a computer for ordinary people seemed absurd at the time. In August 1976, Jobs approached his former boss at Atari, [[Nolan Bushnell]], who recommended that he meet with [[Don Valentine]], the founder of [[Sequoia Capital]].{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=8–10}} Valentine was not interested in funding Apple, but in turn introduced Jobs to [[Mike Markkula]], a millionaire who had worked under him at [[Fairchild Semiconductor]].{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=8–10}} Markkula, unlike Valentine, saw great potential in the two Steves, and decided to become an [[angel investor]] of their company.{{sfn|Schlender|2016|pages=45–47}} He invested $92,000 in Apple out of his own property while securing a $250,000 ({{Inflation|US|250000|1976|fmt=eq|r=-4}}) line of credit from Bank of America.{{sfn|Schlender|2016|pages=45–47}}{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=8–10}} In return for his investment, Markkula received a one-third stake in Apple.{{sfn|Schlender|2016|pages=45–47}} With the help of Markkula, Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977.{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=8–10}} The new corporation bought out the old partnership the two Steves formed nine months earlier.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|pages=77–78}}

In February 1977, Markkula recruited [[Michael Scott (Apple)|Michael Scott]] from [[National Semiconductor]] to serve as the first president and CEO of Apple Computer, as Jobs and Wozniak were both insufficiently experienced and he was not interested in taking that position himself.{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|page=11}}{{sfn|Schlender|2016|pages=48–50}}

Almost as soon as Apple had started selling its first computers, Wozniak moved on from the Apple I and began designing a greatly improved computer: the [[Apple II]].{{sfn|Schlender|2016|pages=45–47}} Wozniak completed a working prototype of the new machine by August 1976.{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=8–10}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |ref={{harvid|Swaine|2014}}|first=Michael |last=Swaine |year=2014 |title=Fire in the Valley: The Birth and Death of the Personal Computer |publisher=Pragmatic Bookshelf |isbn=9781680503524}} p. 344–346&lt;/ref&gt; The two Steves presented the Apple II computer to the public at the first [[West Coast Computer Faire]] on April 16 and 17, 1977. On the first day of the exhibition, Jobs introduced the Apple II to a Japanese chemist named Toshio Mizushima, who became the first authorized Apple dealer in Japan. In the May 1977 issue of [[Byte (magazine)|''Byte'']], Wozniak said of the Apple II design, "To me, a personal computer should be small, reliable, convenient to use, and inexpensive."&lt;ref name="wozniak197705"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1977-05/1977_05_BYTE_02-05_Interfacing#page/n35/mode/2up |title = System Description / The Apple-II |work = BYTE |date = May 1977 |accessdate = November 21, 2019 |last = Wozniak |first = Steve |pages = 34–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Apple II went on sale on June 10, 1977, with a retail price of $1,298.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = June 10, 1977 - Apple II Released Today |work = This Day in History |publisher = Computer History Museum |location = Mountain View, CA |url = http://www.computerhistory.org/tdih/June/10/ |accessdate = November 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The computer's main internal difference from its predecessor was a completely redesigned TV interface, which held the display in memory. Now not only useful for simple text display, the Apple II included graphics and, eventually, color. During the development of the Apple II, Jobs pressed for a well-designed plastic case and built-in keyboard, with the idea that the machine should be fully packaged and ready to run out of the box.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|pages=71–74}} This was almost the case for the Apple I computers, but one still needed to plug various parts together and type in the code to run BASIC. Jobs wanted the Apple II case to be "simple and elegant", and hired an industrial designer named [[Jerry Manock]] to produce such a case design.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|pages=71–74}} Apple employee #5 [[Rod Holt]] developed the [[Switched-mode power supply|switching power supply]].&lt;ref name="wozorgAppleII"&gt;

While early Apple II models use ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded in 1978 by the introduction of a {{Frac|5|1|4}}-inch [[floppy disk]] drive and interface called the [[Disk II]].{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=13–15}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Apple II History Chapter 4 |url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah04/ |first=Steven |last=Weyhrich |date=April 21, 2002 |access-date=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Disk II system was designed by Wozniak and released with a retail price of $495.{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=13–15}}

In 1979, the Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first "[[killer application]]" of the business world: [[VisiCalc]], a [[spreadsheet]].{{Sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=13–15}} So important that the Apple II became what [[John Markoff]] described as a "VisiCalc accessory",&lt;ref name="markoff19820705"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MjAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Radio Shack: set apart from the rest of the field | work=InfoWorld | date=1982-07-05 | accessdate=10 February 2015 | author=Markoff, John | pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; the application created a business market for the computer and gave home users an additional reason to buy it: compatibility with the office.{{Sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=13–15}} Before VisiCalc, Apple had been a distant third place competitor to [[Commodore 64|Commodore]] and [[Tandy Computers|Tandy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bagnall |first=Brian |title=On the Edge: The Spectacular Rise and Fall of Commodore |year=2005 |publisher=Variant Press |isbn=978-0-9738649-0-8 |pages=109–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeremyreimer.com/total_share.html Personal Computer Market Share: 1975–2004] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606003537/http://www.jeremyreimer.com/total_share.html |date=June 6, 2012}} The figures show Mac higher, but that is not a single model.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apple II was one of the three "[[History of personal computers#1977 and the emergence of the "Trinity"|1977 Trinity]]" computers generally credited with creating the [[home computer]] market (the other two being the [[Commodore PET]] and the Tandy Corporation [[TRS-80]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wZ5s5vfAas4C&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=the+home+computer+market+started+with&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YIr7UqycE4fG0AHJ4YDoDA&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20home%20computer%20market%20started%20with&amp;f=false Alfred Dupont Chandler, Takashi Hikino, Andrew Von Nordenflycht, Inventing the Electronic Century: The Epic Story of the Consumer Electronics and Computer Industries,  Harvard University Press, 2009, page 134]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of different models of the Apple II were built thereafter, including the [[Apple IIe]] and [[Apple IIGS|Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;]],{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=17–20}} which continued in public use for nearly two decades.

===Apple III===
{{Main|Apple III}}
[[File:Apple3.jpg|right|thumb|[[Apple III]] with [[Apple Monitor III]].]]
While the Apple II was already established as a successful business-ready platform because of Visicalc, Apple management was not content. The Apple III was designed to take on the business environment in an attempt to compete with [[IBM]] in the business and corporate computing market.{{Sfn|O'Grady|2009|page=6}} While the development of the Apple III started in late 1978 under the guidance of Wendell Sander,{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=81–82}} the machine was subsequently developed by a committee headed by Steve Jobs.{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=41–42}} The Apple III was first announced on May 19, 1980, with a retail price ranging from $4,340
to $7,800, and released in November 1980.{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=41–42}} 

The Apple III was a relatively conservative design for computers of the era. However, Jobs did not want the computer to have a fan; rather, he wanted the heat generated by the electronics to be dissipated through the [[chassis]] of the machine, forgoing the cooling fan. 

However, the physical design of the case was not sufficient to cool the components inside it. By removing the fan from the design, the Apple III was prone to overheating. This caused the [[integrated circuit]] chips to disconnect from the motherboard. Customers who contacted Apple customer service were told to "raise the computers six inches in the air, and then let go", which would cause the ICs to fall back into place.

Thousands of Apple III computers were recalled. A new model was introduced in 1983 to try to rectify the problems, but the damage was already done.

===Apple IPO===
In the July 1980 issue of ''[[Kilobaud Microcomputing]]'', publisher [[Wayne Green]] stated that "the best consumer ads I've seen have been those by Apple. They are attention-getting, and they must be prompting sale."&lt;ref name="green198007"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/kilobaudmagazine-1980-07/Kilobaud_Microcomputing_1980_July#page/n5/mode/2up | title=Publisher's Remarks | work=Kilobaud | date=July 1980 | accessdate=June 23, 2014 | author=Green, Wayne | pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported that

On December 12, 1980, Apple (ticker symbol "AAPL") went public selling 4.6&amp;nbsp;million shares at $22 per share ($.39 per share when adjusting for [[stock split]]s {{As of|2019|03|30|lc=y|df=US}}),&lt;ref name="Apple FAQ"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://investor.apple.com/faq.cfm |publisher=Apple Inc. |access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; generating over $100&amp;nbsp;million, which was more capital than any IPO since [[Ford Motor Company]] in 1956.&lt;ref name=EDNAAPLSTOCK&gt;{{Cite web|first=Suzanne|last=Deffree|url=https://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/edn-moments/4403276/Apple-IPO-makes-instant-millionaires--December-12--1980|title=Apple IPO makes instant millionaires, December 12, 1980|date=December 12, 2018|access-date=May 16, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several venture capitalists cashed out, reaping billions in long-term capital gains.

In January 1981, Apple held its first shareholders meeting as a public company in the [[Flint Center]], a large auditorium at nearby [[De Anza College]] (which is often used for symphony concerts) to handle the larger numbers of shareholders post-IPO. The business of the meeting had been planned so that the voting could be staged in 15 minutes or less. In most cases, voting proxies are collected by mail and counted days or months before a meeting. In this case, after the IPO, many shares were in new hands.
&lt;!--The results of the vote were surprising: a young programmer, [[Randy Wigginton]], received enough votes to be added to Apple's board of directors, through the use of [[cumulative voting]] by a few major shareholders.--&gt;

[[Steve Jobs]] started his prepared speech, but after being interrupted by voting several times, he dropped his prepared speech and delivered a long, emotionally charged talk about betrayal, lack of respect, and related topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pophistorydig.com/topics/tag/apple-computer-ipo/|title=Apple, Rising|website=The Pop History Dig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While IBM began with one microcomputer, little available hardware or software, and a couple of hundred dealers, Apple had five times as many dealers in the US and an established international distribution network. The Apple II had an [[installed base]] of more than 250,000 customers, and hundreds of independent developers offered software and peripherals; at least ten databases and ten word processors were available, while the PC had no databases and one word processor.&lt;ref name="rosen19811130"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SD0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;pg=PA86#v=onepage&amp;f=false | title=From the Rosen Electronics Letter / IBM's impact on microcomputer manufacturers | work=InfoWorld | date=November 30, 1981 | accessdate=January 25, 2015 | author=Rosen Research | pages=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There are two kinds of people in the world: people who say Apple isn't just a company, it's a cause; and people who say Apple isn't a cause, it's just a company. Both groups are right. Nature has suspended the principle of noncontradiction where Apple is concerned.

Apple is more than just a company because its founding has some of the qualities of myth ... Apple is two guys in a garage undertaking the mission of bringing computing power, once reserved for big corporations, to ordinary individuals with ordinary budgets.

Apple Computer's business division was focused on the Apple III, another iteration of the text-based computer. Simultaneously the Lisa group worked on a new machine that would feature a completely different interface and introduce the words ''[[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]'', ''[[Icon (computing)|icon]]'', and ''[[Desktop metaphor|desktop]]'' into the [[lexicon]] of the computing public. In return for the right to buy US$1,000,000 of pre-[[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] stock, Xerox granted Apple Computer three days access to the PARC facilities. After visiting PARC, they came away with new ideas that would complete the foundation for Apple Computer's first [[GUI]] computer, the [[Apple Lisa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mac-history.net/computer-history/2012-03-22/apple-and-xerox-parc|title=Did Steve Jobs steal everything from Xerox PARC?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vectronicsappleworld.com/macintosh/creation.html|title=Apple Lore: The creation of the Macintosh|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323110634/http://www.vectronicsappleworld.com/macintosh/creation.html|archive-date=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/dept/SUL/sites/mac/parc.html|title=The Xerox PARC Visit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2000/foth000918.htm|title=How Xerox Forfeited the PC War|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723144112/http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2000/foth000918.htm|archive-date=July 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first iteration of Apple's [[WIMP (computing)|WIMP]] interface was a floppy disk where files could be spatially moved around. After months of usability testing, Apple designed the Lisa interface of windows and icons.

The Lisa was introduced in 1983 at a cost of US$9,995 ({{Inflation|US|9995|1983|fmt=eq|r=-2}}). Because of the high price, Lisa failed to penetrate the business market.

The Macintosh was too radical for some, who labeled it a mere "toy". Because the machine was entirely designed around the GUI, existing text-mode and [[command line interface|command-driven applications]] had to be redesigned and the programming code rewritten; this was a challenging undertaking that many [[software developer]]s shied away from, and resulted in an initial lack of software for the new system. In April 1984 [[Microsoft]]'s [[MultiPlan]] migrated over from [[MS-DOS]], followed by [[Microsoft Word]] in January 1985.&lt;ref name="hotwyu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pctimeline.info/apple/appl1984.htm |title=Chronology of Apple Computer Personal Computers (1984-1985) |author=Polsson, Ken |accessdate=November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, [[Lotus Software]] introduced [[Lotus Jazz]] after the success of [[Lotus 1-2-3]] for the IBM PC, although it was largely a flop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvorak.org/blog/?page_id=8241|title=Whatever Happened to Lotus Jazz?|author=Dvorak, John|accessdate=January 21, 2007|date=November 26, 2006|publisher=Dvorak Uncensored}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple introduced [[Macintosh Office]] the same year with the [[Lemmings (television commercial)|lemmings ad]], infamous for insulting potential customers. It was not successful.&lt;ref name="Worst Business" /&gt;

For a special post-election edition of ''[[Newsweek]]'' in November 1984, Apple spent more than US$2.5 million to buy all 39 of the advertising pages in the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guidebookgallery.org/ads/magazines/macos/macos10-newsweek|title=1984 ''Newsweek'' Macintosh ads|publisher=GUIdebook, [[Newsweek]]|accessdate=April 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple also ran a "Test Drive a Macintosh" promotion, in which potential buyers with a credit card could take home a Macintosh for 24 hours and return it to a dealer afterwards. While 200,000 people participated, dealers disliked the promotion, the supply of computers was insufficient for demand, and many were returned in such a bad shape that they could no longer be sold. This marketing campaign caused CEO [[John Sculley]] to raise the price from US$1,995 ({{Inflation|US|1995|1984|fmt=eq|r=-2}}) to US$2,495 ({{Inflation|US|2495|1984|fmt=eq|r=-2}}).&lt;ref name="Worst Business"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/16036/Apples-Worst-Business-Decisions/|title=Apple's Worst Business Decisions|author=Hormby, Thomas|publisher=OS News|accessdate=December 24, 2007|date=October 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Macintosh also spawned the concept of [[Apple evangelist|Mac evangelism]], which was pioneered by Apple employee, and later [[Apple Fellow]], [[Guy Kawasaki]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===1985: Jobs and Wozniak leave Apple===
By early 1985, the Macintosh's failure to defeat the IBM PC became clear.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|pages=185–187}}{{sfn|Schlender|2016|pages=84–88}} This triggered a power struggle between Steve Jobs and CEO [[John Sculley]], who had been hired two years earlier by Jobs{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|page=156}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|pages=153-154}} using the famous line, "Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Carmine |last=Gallo |title=How Steve Jobs And Bill Gates Inspired John Sculley To Pursue The 'Noble Cause |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2016/11/12/how-steve-jobs-and-bill-gates-inspired-john-sculley-to-pursue-the-noble-cause/#9eaee3232bd5 |website=[[Forbes]] |date=January 22, 2014 |accessdate=March 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sculley and Jobs' visions for the company greatly differed. The former favored [[open architecture]] computers like the Apple II, sold to education, small business, and home markets less vulnerable to IBM. Jobs wanted the company to focus on the [[closed architecture]] Macintosh as a business alternative to the IBM PC. President and CEO Sculley had little control over Chairman of the Board Jobs' Macintosh division; it and the Apple II division operated like separate companies, duplicating services.&lt;ref name="robbeloth198510_11"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/II_Computing_Vol_1_No_1_Oct_Nov_85_Premiere#page/n7/mode/2up | title=Whither Apple? | work=II Computing | date=Oct–Nov 1985 | accessdate=January 28, 2015 | author=Robbeloth, DeWitt | pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although its products provided 85% of Apple's sales in early 1985, the company's January 1985 [[annual meeting]] did not mention the Apple II division or employees. This frustrated Wozniak, who left active employment at Apple early that same year to pursue other ventures, stating that the company had "been going in the wrong direction for the last five years" and sold most of his stock.&lt;ref name="rice19850415"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zC4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;pg=PA35 |title= Unrecognized Apple II Employees Exit |work=[[InfoWorld]] |date= April 15, 1985 |accessdate= February 4, 2015 |last= Rice |first= Valerie |page= 35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wozemployee"&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://woz.org/letters/never-left-apple/ |title= I Never Left Apple |date= January 3, 2018 |work= Officially Woz |access-date= October 2, 2018 |language= en-US }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/bestoftv/2011/08/25/exp.piers.wozniak.jobs.reaction.cnn |work=[[CNN]] |title= CNN.com Video }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these grievances, Wozniak left the company amicably and as of January 2018 continues to represent Apple at events or in interviews,&lt;ref name="wozemployee"/&gt; receiving a stipend over the years for this role estimated in 2006 to be $120,000 per year.&lt;ref name="iWoz"&gt;{{cite book |last= Wozniak |first= Steve |authorlink= Steve Wozniak |last2= Smith |first2= Gina |author2link= Gina Smith (author) |year= 2006 |title= iWoz: Computer Geek to Cult Icon: How I Invented the Personal Computer, Co-Founded Apple, and Had Fun Doing It |publisher=[[W.

In April 1985, Sculley decided to remove Jobs as the general manager of the Macintosh division, and gained unanimous support from the Apple board of directors.{{sfn|Schlender|2016|pages=87–92}}{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|page=156}} Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple.{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=156-157}} Informed by [[Jean-Louis Gassée]], Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a [[coup d'état#Other uses of the term|coup]] and called an emergency executive meeting at which Apple's executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties.{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=156-157}} 

Jobs, while taking the position of Chairman of the firm, had no influence over Apple's direction and subsequently resigned from Apple in September 1985 and took a number of capable Apple employees with him to found [[NeXT|NeXT Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Spector |first=G |title=Apple's Jobs Starts New Firm, Targets Education Market |work=[[PC Week]] |page=109 |date=September 24, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a show of defiance at being set aside by Apple Computer, Jobs sold all but one of his 6.5 million shares in the company for $70 million. Jobs then acquired the [[visual effects]] house, [[Pixar]] for $5M ({{Inflation|US|5000000|1986|fmt=eq|r=-5}}). NeXT Inc. would build computers with futuristic designs and the UNIX-derived [[NEXTSTEP]] operating system. NeXTSTEP would eventually be developed into Mac OS X. While not a commercial success, due in part to its high price, the NeXT computer would introduce important concepts to the history of the personal computer (including serving as the initial platform for [[Tim Berners-Lee]] as he was developing the [[World Wide Web]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/WorldWideWeb |title=Tim Berners-Lee: client |publisher=W3.org |accessdate=July 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sculley reorganized the company, unifying sales and marketing in one division and product operations and development in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Steve Jobs|first1=Walter|last1=Isaacson|author-link1=Walter Isaacson|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|isbn=978-1442369054}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|robbeloth198510_11}} Despite initial marketing difficulties, the Macintosh brand was eventually a success for Apple. This was due to its introduction of [[desktop publishing]] (and later [[computer animation]]) through Apple's partnership with [[Adobe Systems]], which introduced the [[laser printer]] and [[Adobe PageMaker]]. Indeed, the Macintosh would become known as the de-facto platform for many industries including cinema, music, advertising, publishing, and the arts.

===Corporate performance===
{{See also|List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple}}
Under leadership of [[John Sculley]], Apple issued its first corporate stock dividend on May 11, 1987. A month later on June 16, Apple stock split for the first time in a 2:1 split. Apple kept a quarterly dividend with about 0.3% yield until November 21, 1995.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Between March 1988 and January 1989, Apple undertook five acquisitions, including software companies Network Innovations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/03/business/apple-buying-software-unit.html|title=Apple Buying Software Unit|date=March 2, 1988|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Styleware,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/28/business/company-news-apple-unit-buys-software-concern.html|title=COMPANY NEWS; Apple Unit Buys Software Concern|date=June 27, 1988|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nashoba Systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnnqMuqnQHMC&amp;pg=PP8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Claris buys Nashoba Systems|author=Julie Pitta|magazine=[[Computerworld]]|date=July 11, 1988|volume=22|issue=28|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Coral Software,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/apple-acquires-lisp-company/184408125|title=Apple Acquires Lisp Company|author=Michael Swaine|date=April 1, 1989|magazine=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as satellite communications company Orion Network Systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wL3IuM3qW4UC&amp;pg=PA2-IA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Apple buys Orion, aims to mine SNA|author=Julie Pitta|magazine=Computerworld|date=June 13, 1988|volume=22|issue=24|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple continued to sell both lines of its computers, the Apple II and the Macintosh. A few months after introducing the Mac, Apple released a compact version of the Apple II called the [[Apple IIc]]. And in 1986 Apple introduced the [[Apple IIgs]], an Apple II positioned as something of a hybrid product with a mouse-driven, Mac-like operating environment. Even with the release of the first Macintosh, Apple II computers remained the main source of income for Apple for years.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Jobs, official biography&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Mac family===
{{See also|Timeline of Macintosh models}}
At the same time, the Mac was becoming a product family of its own. The original model evolved into the [[Macintosh Plus|Mac Plus]] in 1986 and spawned the [[Macintosh SE|Mac SE]] and the [[Macintosh II|Mac II]] in 1987 and the [[Macintosh Classic|Mac Classic]] and [[Macintosh LC|Mac LC]] in 1990. Meanwhile, Apple attempted its first portable Macs: the failed [[Macintosh Portable]] in 1989 and then the more popular [[PowerBook]] in 1991, a landmark product that established the modern form and [[ergonomics|ergonomic]] layout of the laptop. Popular products and increasing revenues made this a good time for Apple. [[MacAddict]] magazine has called 1989 to 1991 the "first golden age" of the Macintosh.

On February 19, 1987, Apple registered the "[[Apple.com]]" domain name, making it one of the first hundred companies to register a [[.com]] address on the nascent Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelongestlistofthelongeststuffatthelongestdomainnameatlonglast.com/first71.html First dot com .com ever in the world. symbolics.com cmu.edu purdue.edu rice.edu ucla.edu think.com css.gov mitre.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early-mid-1990s===
In the late 1980s, Apple's fiercest technological rivals were the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] platforms. But computers based on the [[IBM PC]] were far more popular than all three, and by the 1990s, they finally had a comparable [[GUI]] thanks to [[Windows 3.0]], and were out-competing Apple.

Apple's response to the PC threat was a profusion of new Macintosh lines such as [[Macintosh Quadra|Quadra]], [[Macintosh Centris|Centris]], and [[Macintosh Performa|Performa]]. However, these new lines were marketed poorly by what was now "arguably one of the worst-managed companies in the industry".&lt;ref name="alsop19960205" /&gt; For one, there were too many models, differentiated by very minor graduations in their [[technical specifications|tech specs]]. The excess of arbitrary model numbers confused many consumers and hurt Apple's reputation for simplicity. Apple's retail resellers like [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]] and [[CompUSA]] often failed to sell or even competently display these Macs. Compounding matters was the fact that, although the machines were cheaper than a comparable PC (when taken into account all the components built-in that had to be added to the 'bare bones PC'), the poor marketing gave the impression that the machines were more expensive.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Inventory grew as Apple consistently underestimated demand for popular models and overestimated demand for others.&lt;ref name="alsop19960205" /&gt;

In 1991, Apple partnered with long-time competitor [[IBM]] and [[Motorola]] to form the [[AIM alliance]]. The ultimate goal was to create a revolutionary new computing platform, known as [[PReP]], which would use IBM and Motorola hardware and Apple software. As the first step toward the PReP platform, Apple started the [[Power Macintosh]] line in 1994, using [[PowerPC]] processors from Motorola and IBM. These processors used a [[RISC]] architecture, which differed substantially from the Motorola [[68000|680X0]] series that were used by all previous Macs. Parts of Apple's operating system software were rewritten so that most software written for older Macs could run in [[emulator|emulation]] on the PowerPC series.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Apple also refused IBM's offer to purchase the company, but later unsuccessfully sought another offer from IBM,&lt;ref name=markoff19970901&gt;{{cite news|last=Markoff|first=John|title=An 'Unknown' Co-Founder Leaves After 20 Years of Glory and Turmoil|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/01/business/an-unknown-co-founder-leaves-after-20-years-of-glory-and-turmoil.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=February 4, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 1, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at one point was "hours away" from an acquisition by [[Sun Microsystems]].&lt;ref name="alsop19960205"&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,984054,00.html | title=Apple of Sun's Eye | accessdate=February 23, 2011 | author=Alsop, Stewart | date=February 5, 1996 | magazine=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="preimesberger20110225"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/IT-Infrastructure/How-Apple-Dodged-a-Sun-Buyout-Former-CEOs-McNealy-Zander-Tell-All-251679 | title=How Apple Dodged a Sun Buyout: Former CEOs McNealy, Zander Tell All | accessdate=February 2, 2016 | author=Preimesberger, Chris | date=February 25, 2011 | publisher=eWeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to computers, Apple has also produced consumer devices. In 1993, Apple released the [[Newton (platform)|Newton]], an early [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA). It defined and launched the PDA category and was a forerunner and inspiration of devices such as [[Palm Pilot]] and [[Pocket PC]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In 1994 Apple launched [[eWorld]], an online service providing email, news and a bulletin board system to replace [[AppleLink]]. It was shut down in 1996.

In 1995 a decision was made to (officially) start licensing the Mac OS and Macintosh ROMs to 3rd party manufacturers who started producing Macintosh "clones". This was done in order to achieve deeper market penetration and extra revenue for the company. This decision led to Apple having over a 10% market share until 1997 when Steve Jobs was re-hired as interim CEO to replace Gil Amelio. Jobs promptly found a loophole in the licensing contracts Apple had with the clone manufacturers and terminated the Macintosh OS licensing program, ending the Macintosh clone era. The result of this action was that Macintosh computer market share quickly fell from 10% to around 3%.

In 1996, the struggling [[NeXT]] company beat out Be Inc.'s [[BeOS]] in its bid to sell its operating system to Apple. Apple purchased [[Steve Jobs]]' company, NeXT on December 10, 1996, and its NeXTstep operating system. This would not only bring Steve Jobs back to Apple's management, but NeXT technology would become the foundation of the [[Mac OS X]] operating system.

==1997–2001: Apple's comeback==

===Return of Steve Jobs===
On July 9, 1997, [[Gil Amelio]] was ousted as CEO of Apple by the board of directors. Jobs stepped in as the interim CEO to begin a critical restructuring of the company's product line. He would eventually become CEO and served in that position until August 2011. On August 24, 2011, Steve Jobs resigned his position as chief executive officer of Apple before his long battle with pancreatic cancer took his life on October 5, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Primack|first=Doug|title=Fallen Apple: Steve Jobs resigns|date=August 24, 2011|url=https://fortune.com/2011/08/24/fallen-apple-steve-jobs-resigns/|access-date=January 14, 2020|magazine=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 1997, Apple introduced the [[Apple Store (online)|Apple Store]], an online retail store based upon the [[WebObjects]] application server the company had acquired in its purchase of [[NeXT]]. The new direct sales outlet was also tied to a new build-to-order manufacturing strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Harreld|first=Heather|url=http://www.fcw.com/print/3_1/news/64412-1.html?type=pf|title=Apple gains tech, agency customers in Next deal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206061012/http://www.fcw.com/print/3_1/news/64412-1.html?type=pf|archive-date=December 6, 2008|magazine=[[Federal Computer Week]]|date=January 5, 1997|access-date=August 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5564882_ITM|title=Apple unveils new marketing strategy|publisher=Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service|date=November 1997|access-date=August 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microsoft deal===
At the 1997 [[Macworld Expo]], Steve Jobs announced that Apple would be entering into a partnership with [[Microsoft]]. Included in this was a five-year commitment from Microsoft to release [[Microsoft Office]] for Macintosh as well as a US$150 million investment in Apple. As part of the deal, Apple and Microsoft agreed to settle a long-standing dispute over whether Microsoft's Windows operating system infringed on any of Apple's patents.&lt;ref name="Microsoft investment"&gt;{{cite web | title=Microsoft to invest $150 million in Apple |publisher=CNET News | url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-202143.html|date=August 6, 1997|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also announced that [[Internet Explorer for Mac|Internet Explorer]] would be shipped as the default browser on the Macintosh, with the user being able to have a preference. Microsoft chairman [[Bill Gates]] appeared at the expo on-screen, further explaining Microsoft's plans for the software they were developing for Mac, and stating that he was very excited to be helping Apple return to success. After this, Steve Jobs said this to the audience at the expo:

{{quote|If we want to move forward and see Apple healthy and prospering again, we have to let go of a few things here. We have to let go of this notion that for Apple to win, Microsoft has to lose. We have to embrace a notion that for Apple to win, Apple has to do a really good job. And if others are going to help us that's great, because we need all the help we can get, and if we screw up and we don't do a good job, it's not somebody else's fault, it's our fault. So I think that is a very important perspective. If we want Microsoft Office on the Mac, we better treat the company that puts it out with a little bit of gratitude; we'd like their software.

So, the era of setting this up as a competition between Apple and Microsoft is over as far as I'm concerned. This is about getting Apple healthy, this is about Apple being able to make incredibly great contributions to the industry and to get healthy and prosper again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mac-history.net/apple-history-tv/2008-07-19/macworld-boston-1997-steve-jobs-returns-bill-gates-appeares-on-screen | title=MacWorld Boston 1997 – Steve Jobs returns – Bill Gates appeares on-screen | work=Mac History | date=Oct 2010 | accessdate=19 Mar 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The day before the announcement Apple had a market cap of $2.46 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Apple market cap August 5, 1997 – Wolfram Alpha | url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Apple+market+cap+August+5%2C+1997|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had ended its previous quarter with quarterly revenues of US$1.7 billion and cash reserves of US$1.2 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Conference Call, 07/17/97 Apple Q3 '97 | url=https://www.fool.com/Calls/1997/Calls970717AAPL.htm | accessdate=November 26, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131129003410/https://www.fool.com/Calls/1997/Calls970717AAPL.htm | archive-date=November 29, 2013 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; making the US$150 million amount of the investment largely symbolic. Apple CFO Fred Anderson stated that Apple would use the additional funds to invest in its core markets of education and creative content.&lt;ref name="Microsoft investment"/&gt;

===iMac, iBook, and Power Mac G4===
[[File:IMac Bondi Blue.jpg|right|thumb|The original [[iMac]]]]
While discontinuing Apple's licensing of its operating system to third-party computer manufacturers, one of Jobs's first moves as new acting CEO was to develop the [[iMac]], which bought Apple time to restructure. The original iMac integrated a CRT display and CPU into a streamlined, translucent plastic body. The line became a sales smash, moving about one million units each year. It also helped re-introduce Apple to the media and public and announced the company's new emphasis on the design and aesthetics of its products.

In 1999, Apple introduced the [[Power Mac G4]], which utilized the Motorola-made PowerPC 7400 containing a 128-bit instruction unit known as [[AltiVec]], its flagship processor line. Also that year, Apple unveiled the [[iBook]], its first consumer-oriented laptop that was also the first Macintosh to support the use of [[Wireless LAN]] via the optional AirPort card that was based on the 802.11b standard; it helped popularize the use of Wireless LAN technology to connect computers to networks.

===Mac OS X===
{{Main|Mac OS X}}
[[File:Apple Headquarters in Cupertino.jpg|right|thumb|Company headquarters on Infinite Loop in [[Cupertino, California]]]]
In 2001, Apple introduced [[macOS|Mac OS X (now known as macOS)]], an operating system based on [[NeXT]]'s [[NeXTSTEP]] and incorporating parts of the [[FreeBSD]] kernel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Amit Singh |url=http://osxbook.com/book/bonus/ancient/whatismacosx/arch_xnu.html |title=What is Mac OS X? - XNU: The Kernel |website=Mac OS X Internals |accessdate=May 25, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aimed at consumers and professionals alike, Mac OS X married the stability, reliability and security of [[Unix]] with the ease of a completely overhauled user interface. To aid users in transitioning their applications from [[Mac OS 9]], the new operating system allowed the use of Mac OS 9 applications through the [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]] environment. Apple's [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]] API also allowed developers to adapt their Mac OS 9 software to use Mac OS X's features.

===Retail stores===
{{Main|Apple Store}}
In May 2001, after much speculation, Apple announced the opening of a line of Apple retail stores, to be located throughout the major U.S. computer buying markets. The stores were designed for two primary purposes: to stem the tide of Apple's declining share of the computer market and to respond to poor marketing of Apple products at third-party retail outlets.

==2001–2007: iPods, iTunes Store, Intel transition==

===iPod===
{{Main|iPod}}
[[File:IPod 2G.jpg|right|thumb|A 2nd generation [[iPod]]]]
[[File:IPod mini.png|right|thumb|[[iPod mini]] with the UI (user interface) set to German]]
In October 2001, Apple introduced its first [[iPod]] portable digital audio player. Then iPod started as a 5 gigabyte player capable of storing around 1000 songs. Since then it has evolved into an array of products including the [[iPod Mini|Mini]] (now discontinued), the [[iPod Touch]], the [[iPod Shuffle|Shuffle]] (now discontinued), the [[iPod Classic]] (also discontinued), the [[iPod Nano|Nano]] (now discontinued), the [[iPhone]] and the [[iPad]]. Since March 2011, the largest storage capacity for an iPod has been 160 gigabytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Apple, Inc. |url=https://www.apple.com/ipodclassic/specs.html |title= iPod Classic |work=apple.com |accessdate=November 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to software developers on June 6, 2005, Steve Jobs said the company's share of the entire portable music device market stood at 76%.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The iPod gave an enormous lift to Apple's financial results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date= April 13, 2005|url= https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2005/04/13Apple-Reports-Second-Quarter-Results/|title= Apple Reports Second Quarter Results|publisher= [[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate= May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the quarter ending March 26, 2005, Apple earned US$290 million, or 34¢ a share, on sales of US$3.24 billion. The year before in the same quarter, Apple earned just US$46 million, or 6¢ a share, on revenue of US$1.91 billion.

===Moving on from colored plastics and the PowerPC G3===
In early 2002, Apple unveiled a completely redesigned iMac, using the G4 processor and LCD display. The new [[iMac G4]] design had a white hemispherical base and a flat panel all-digital display supported by a swiveling chrome neck. After several iterations increasing the processing speed and screen sizes from 15" to 17" to 20" the iMac G4 was discontinued and replaced by the [[iMac G5]] in the summer of 2004.

In 2002, Apple also released the [[Xserve]] [[Rack unit|1U]] [[rack mount]]ed server. Originally featuring two G4 chips, the Xserve was unusual for Apple in two ways. It represented an earnest effort to enter the enterprise computer market and it was also relatively cheaper than similar machines released by its competitors. This was due, in no small part, to Apple's use of Fast ATA drives as opposed to the SCSI hard drives used in traditional rack-mounted servers. Apple later released the [[Xserve RAID]], a 14 drive [[RAID]] that was, again, cheaper than competing systems.

In mid-2003, Steve Jobs launched the [[Power Mac G5]], based on [[IBM]]'s [[PowerPC 970|G5 processor]]. Its all-metal [[anodized aluminum]] chassis finished Apple's transition away from colored plastics in their computers. Apple claims this was the first 64-bit computer sold to the general public. The Power Mac G5 was also used by Virginia Tech to build its prototype [[System X (computing)|System X]] supercomputing cluster, which at the time garnered the prestigious recognition of the third-fastest supercomputer in the world. It cost only US$5.2 million to build, far less than the previous No. 3 and other ranking supercomputers. Apple's Xserves were soon updated to use the G5 as well. They replaced the Power Mac G5 machines as the main building block of [[Virginia Tech]]'s [[System X (computing)|System X]], which was ranked in November 2004 as the world's seventh-fastest [[supercomputer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.top500.org/lists/2004/11/|title= TOP500 List for November 2004|publisher= top500.org|accessdate= November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new iMac based on the G5 processor was unveiled August 31, 2004 and was made available in mid-September. This model dispensed with the base altogether, placing the CPU and the rest of the computing hardware behind the flat-panel screen, which is suspended from a streamlined aluminum foot. This new iMac, dubbed the [[iMac G5]], was the "world's thinnest desktop computer",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1641125,00.asp|title=Apple Unveils 'World's Thinnest Desktop'|author=Ian Betteridge|date=August 31, 2004|website=[[PC Magazine]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; measuring in at around two inches (around 5 centimeters).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apple-history.com/imac_g5|title=apple-history.com / iMac G5|last=Sanford|first=Glen D|website=apple-history.com|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2004, however, was a turning point for Apple. After creating a sizable financial base to work with, the company began experimenting with new parts from new suppliers. As a result, Apple was able to produce new designs quickly over a short amount of time, with the release of the iPod Video, then the iPod Classic, and eventually the iPod touch and iPhone.

On April 29, 2005, Apple released [[Mac OS X v10.4]] "Tiger" to the general public.

Apple's wildly successful [[PowerBook]] and [[iBook]] products relied on Apple's previous generation G4 architecture, which was produced by [[Freescale Semiconductor]], a spin-off from Motorola. Engineers at IBM had minimal success in making their PowerPC G5 processor consume less power and run cooler but not enough to run in iBook or PowerBook formats. As of the week of October 24, 2005, Apple released the Power Mac G5 Dual that features a Dual-Core processor. This processor contains two cores in one rather than have two separate processors. Apple has also developed the Power Mac G5 Quad that uses two of the Dual-Core processors for enhanced workstation power and performance. The new Power Mac G5 Dual cores run individually at 2.0&amp;nbsp;GHz or 2.3&amp;nbsp;GHz. The Power Mac G5 Quad cores run individually at 2.5&amp;nbsp;GHz and all variations have a graphics processor that has 256-bit memory bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Gibson|first= Brad|date= September 1, 2004|url= http://www.macobserver.com/article/2004/09/01.4.shtml|title= Apple Expo – Apple Exec: No G5 Laptop "Anytime Soon"|work= |pages= |publisher= macobserver.com|accessdate= May 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retail store expansion===
Initially, the [[Apple Store]]s were only opened in the United States, but in late 2003, Apple opened its first Apple Store abroad, in Tokyo's [[Ginza]] district. Ginza was followed by a store in [[Osaka, Osaka|Osaka]], Japan in August 2004. In 2005, Apple opened stores in [[Nagoya, Aichi|Nagoya]], the [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] district of Tokyo, [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]], and [[Sendai, Miyagi|Sendai]]. Another store was opened in [[Sapporo, Hokkaidō|Sapporo]] in 2006. Apple's first European store opened in London, on [[Regent Street]], in November 2004. A store in the [[Bull Ring, Birmingham|Bullring]] shopping centre in [[Birmingham]] opened in April 2005, and the [[Bluewater Shopping Centre|Bluewater]] shopping centre in [[Dartford]], Kent opened in July 2005. Apple opened its first store in Canada in the middle of 2005 at the [[Yorkdale Shopping Centre]] in [[North York, Ontario|North York]], [[Toronto]]. Later on in 2005 Apple opened the [[Meadowhall Centre|Meadowhall]] Store in [[Sheffield]] and the [[Trafford Centre]] Store in [[Manchester]] (UK). Recent additions in the London area include the [[Brent Cross]] Apple Store (January 2006), the Apple Store in [[Westfield London|Westfield]] in Shepherd's Bush (September 2008) and the Apple Store in [[Covent Garden]] (August 2010), which is currently the largest store&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/business/sectors/technology/is-apple-store-in-dubai-the-world-s-largest-1.1607915|title=
Is Apple Store in Dubai the world's largest?|date=October 27, 2015|author=Scott Shuey|newspaper=[[Gulf News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the world.

Also, in an effort to court a broader market, Apple opened several "mini" stores in October 2004 in an attempt to capture markets where demand does not necessarily dictate a full-scale store. The first of these stores was opened at [[Stanford Shopping Center]] in [[Palo Alto, California]]. These stores follow in the footsteps of the successful Apple products: iPod mini and Mac mini. These stores are only one half the square footage of the smallest "normal" store and thus can be placed in several smaller markets.

===Apple and "i" Web services===
In 2000, Apple introduced its iTools service, a set of free web-based tools that included an email account, internet greeting cards called iCards, a service called [[iReview]] that gave internet users a place to read and write reviews of Web sites, and a tool called KidSafe that promised to prevent children from browsing inappropriate portions of the [[world wide web|web]]. The latter two services were eventually canceled because of lack of success, while iCards and email became integrated into Apple's [[.Mac]] subscription-based service introduced in 2002 and discontinued in mid-2008 to make way for the release of the new MobileMe service, coinciding with the iPhone 3G release. MobileMe, which carried the same US$99.00 annual subscription price as its Mac predecessor, featured the addition of "push" services to instantly and automatically send emails, contacts and calendar updates directly to users' iPhone devices. Some controversy surrounded the release of MobileMe services to users resulting in expected downtime and a significantly longer release window. As a result of this, Apple extended the subscriptions of existing MobileMe subscribers by an additional 30 days free-of-charge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macrumors.com/2008/07/16/apple-sends-apology-letter-30-day-extension-to-mobileme-customers Apple Sends Apology Letter, 30-Day Extension to MobileMe Customers]&lt;/ref&gt; At the WWDC event in June 2011, Apple announced its most up to date cloud service, [[iCloud]], replacing MobileMe. This service kept most of the core services that MobileMe offered, however dropping iDisk, Gallery, and iWeb. Additionally, it added a number of other features to the group, including Find my Mac, iTunes Match, Photo Stream, Documents &amp; Data Backup, and iCloud backup for iOS devices. The service requires users to be running iOS 5 and OS X 10.7 Lion.

===iTunes Store===
{{Main|iTunes Store}}
The [[iTunes Store|iTunes Music Store]] was launched in April 2003, with 2 million downloads in the first 16 days. Music was purchased through the [[iTunes]] application, which was initially Macintosh-only; in October 2003, support for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] was added. Initially, the music store was only available in the United States due to licensing restrictions.

In June 2004 Apple opened its iTunes Music Store in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. A version for the [[European Union]] version opened October 2004, but it was not initially available in the [[Republic of Ireland]] due to the intransigence of the [[Irish Recorded Music Association]] (IRMA) but was opened there a few months later on Thursday, January 6, 2005. A version for Canada opened in December 2004. On May 10, 2005, the iTunes Music Store was expanded to [[Denmark]], Norway, [[Sweden]], and [[Switzerland]].

On December 16, 2004, Apple sold its 200 millionth song on the iTunes Music Store to Ryan Alekman from [[Belchertown, Massachusetts]]. The download was ''[[The Complete U2]]'', by [[U2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date= December 16, 2004|url= https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2004/12/16iTunes-Music-Store-Downloads-Top-200-Million-Songs/|title= iTunes Music Store Downloads Top 200 Million Songs|publisher= [[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate= May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just under three months later Apple sold its 300 millionth song on March 2, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date= March 2, 2005|url= https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2005/03/02iTunes-Music-Store-Downloads-Surpass-300-Million/|title= iTunes Music Store Downloads Surpass 300 Million|publisher= [[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate= May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 17, 2005, the iTunes Music Store sold its 500 millionth song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date= July 18, 2005|url= https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2005/07/18iTunes-Music-Store-Downloads-Top-Half-a-Billion-Songs/|title= iTunes Music Store Downloads Top Half a Billion Songs|publisher= [[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate= October 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that point, songs were selling at an accelerating annualized rate of more than 500 million.

On October 25, 2005, the iTunes Store went live in Australia, with songs selling for [[Australian dollar|A$]]1.69 each, albums at (generally) A$16.99 and music videos and Pixar short films at A$3.39. Briefly, people in [[New Zealand]] were able to buy music off the Australian store. However, that loophole was quickly closed.

On February 23, 2006, the iTunes Music Store sold its 1 billionth song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date= February 23, 2006|url= https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2006/02/23iTunes-Music-Store-Downloads-Top-One-Billion-Songs/|title= iTunes Music Store Downloads Top One Billion Songs|publisher= [[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate= May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iTunes Music Store changed its name to iTunes Store on September 12, 2006, when it began offering video content (TV shows and movies) for sale. Since iTunes' inception, it has sold over 2 billion songs, 1.2 billion of which were sold in 2006. Since downloadable TV and movie content was added 50 million TV episodes and 1.3 million movies have been downloaded.

In early 2010, Apple celebrated the 10 billionth song downloaded from the iTunes Music Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date= February 25, 2010 |url= https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2010/02/25iTunes-Store-Tops-10-Billion-Songs-Sold/|title= iTunes Store Tops 10 Billion Songs Sold|publisher= Apple Inc.|accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intel transition===
{{Main|Apple–Intel transition}}

In a keynote address on June 6, 2005, Steve Jobs officially announced that Apple would begin producing Intel-based Macintosh computers beginning in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date=June 6, 2005|url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2005/06/06Apple-to-Use-Intel-Microprocessors-Beginning-in-2006/|title=Apple to Use Intel Microprocessors Beginning in 2006|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs confirmed rumors that the company had secretly been producing versions of its current operating system [[macOS|Mac OS X]] for both PowerPC and Intel processors over the past 5 years, and that the transition to Intel processor systems would last until the end of 2007. Rumors of cross-platform compatibility had been spurred by the fact that Mac OS X is based on [[OpenStep]], an operating system that was available for many platforms. In fact, Apple's own [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]], the [[open-source software|open source]] underpinnings of Mac OS X, was also available for Intel's x86 architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/Apple-shakes-hands-with-Intel/2009-1006_3-5733319.html |title=Apple shakes hands with Intel|date=June 6, 2005 |work=[[CNET]] |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=May 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=June 6, 2005|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1112 |title=Apple confirms switch to Intel|work=[[AppleInsider]] |accessdate=May 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Markoff |first1=John |authorlink=John Markoff |last2=Lohr |first2=Steve |date=June 6, 2005 |url=https://nytimes.com/2005/06/06/technology/06apple.html |title=Apple Plans to Switch From I.B.M. to Intel Chips |work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 10, 2006, the first Intel-based machines, the [[iMac]] and [[MacBook Pro]], were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Apple Unveils New iMac with Intel Core Duo Processor |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |date=January 10, 2006 |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2006/01/10Apple-Unveils-New-iMac-with-Intel-Core-Duo-Processor/ |accessdate=May 25, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Apple Introduces MacBook Pro |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |date=January 10, 2006 |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2006/01/10Apple-Introduces-MacBook-Pro/ |accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were based on the [[Intel Core]] Duo platform. This introduction came with the news that Apple would complete the transition to Intel processors on all hardware by the end of 2006, a year ahead of the originally quoted schedule.

==2007–2011: Apple Inc., iPhone, iOS, iPad==
On January 9, 2007, Apple Computer, Inc. shortened its name to simply Apple Inc. In his [[Macworld Expo]] keynote address, Steve Jobs explained that with their current product mix consisting of the iPod and Apple TV as well as their Macintosh brand, Apple really wasn't just a computer company anymore. At the same address, Jobs revealed a product that would revolutionize an industry in which Apple had never previously competed: the Apple [[iPhone]]. The iPhone combined Apple's first widescreen iPod with the world's first mobile device boasting visual voicemail, and an internet communicator able to run a fully-functional version of Apple's web browser, [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], on the then-named [[iOS version history#Version history: portable iOS devices|iPhone OS]] (later renamed [[iOS]]).

===iOS evolution: iPhone and iPad===
{{Main|iOS|iPhone|iPad}}
The first version of the iPhone became publicly available on June 29, 2007, in selected countries/markets. It was another 12 months before the [[iPhone 3G]] became available on July 11, 2008. Apple announced the [[iPhone 3GS]] on June 8, 2009, along with plans to release it later in June, July, and August, starting with the U.S., Canada, and major European countries on June 19. This 12-month iteration cycle has continued with the [[iPhone 4]] model arriving in similar fashion in 2010, a Verizon model was released in February 2011, and a Sprint model in October 2011, shortly after Jobs' death.

On February 10, 2011, the iPhone 4 was made available on both Verizon Wireless and AT&amp;T. Now two iPod types are multi-touch: the iPod nano and the iPod touch, a big advance in technology. Apple TV currently has a 2nd generation model, which is 4 times smaller than the original Apple TV. Apple has also gone wireless, selling a wireless trackpad, keyboard, mouse, and external hard drive. Wired accessories are, however, still available.

The Apple [[iPad]] was announced on January 27, 2010, with retail availability commencing in April and systematically growing in markets throughout 2010. The iPad fits into Apple's iOS product line, being twice the screen size of an iPhone without the phone abilities. While there were initial fears of product cannibalization the FY2010 financial results released in Jan 2011 included commentary of a reverse 'halo' effect, where iPad sales were leading to increased sales of iMacs and MacBooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2011/01/18Apple-Reports-First-Quarter-Results/ |title=Apple Reports First Quarter Results |publisher=Apple Inc. |date=January 18, 2011 |accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resurgence compared to Microsoft===
Since 2005, Apple's revenues, profits, and stock price have grown significantly. On May 26, 2010, Apple's stock market value overtook Microsoft's,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Miguel |last1=Helft |first2=Ashlee |last2=Vance |title=Apple Passes Microsoft as No. 1 in Tech |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/technology/27apple.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 26, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Rigby |title=Apple overtakes Microsoft as biggest tech company |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-stock-idUSTRE64P5PE20100526 |website=[[Reuters]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |date=May 26, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Blake |last=Ellis |title=Apple topples Microsoft's throne |url=http://money.cnn.com/2010/05/26/technology/apple_microsoft/index.htm |website=[[CNNMoney]] |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=May 27, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Apple's revenues surpassed those of Microsoft in the third quarter of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Slivka |title=Apple Tops Microsoft in Third Quarter Revenue |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2010/10/28/apple-tops-microsoft-in-third-quarter-revenue/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=October 28, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ed |last=Sutherland |title=Apple Tops Microsoft Revenue in Third Quarter |url=http://www.cultofmac.com/66698/apple-tops-microsoft-revenue-in-third-quarter/66698/ |website=Cult of Mac |date=October 29, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After giving their results for the first quarter of 2011, Microsoft's net profits of $5.2 billion were lower for the quarter than those of Apple, which earned $6 billion in net profit for the quarter.&lt;ref name="Apple Microsoft revenue"&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Bright |title=Microsoft beats estimates, but not Apple in third quarter earnings |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2011/04/microsoft-beats-estimates-but-not-apple-in-third-quarter-earnings/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=April 28, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Verne G. |last=Kopytoff |title=PC Sales Off, Games Buoy Microsoft |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/technology/29microsoft.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 28, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late April announcement of profits by the companies marked the first time in 20 years that Microsoft's profits had been lower than Apple's,&lt;ref name="Apple Microsoft 20 years"&gt;{{cite web |first=Charles |last=Arthur |title=Microsoft falls behind Apple for first time in 20 years |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/apr/28/microsoft-falls-behind-apple |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=April 28, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a situation described by ''[[Ars Technica]]'' as "unimaginable a decade ago".&lt;ref name="Apple Microsoft revenue"/&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that one of the reasons for the change was because PC software, where Microsoft dominates, has become less important compared to the tablet and smartphone markets, where Apple has a strong presence.&lt;ref name="Apple Microsoft 20 years"/&gt; One reason for this was a surprise drop in PC sales in the quarter.&lt;ref name="Apple Microsoft 20 years"/&gt; Another issue for Microsoft was that its online search business had lost a lot of money, with a loss of $700 million in the first quarter of 2010.&lt;ref name="Apple Microsoft 20 years"/&gt;

==2011–present: Restructuring and Apple Watch==

On March 2, 2011, Apple unveiled the iPad's second-generation model, the [[iPad 2]]. Like the 4th generation iPod Touch and iPhone, the iPad 2 comes with a front-facing camera as well as a rear-facing camera, along with three new apps that utilize these new features: Camera, [[FaceTime]], and [[Photo Booth]].

On August 24, 2011, Steve Jobs resigned from his position as CEO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2011/08/24Steve-Jobs-Resigns-as-CEO-of-Apple/|title=Steve Jobs Resigns as CEO of Apple|date=August 24, 2011|publisher=Apple Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Tim Cook taking his place.
