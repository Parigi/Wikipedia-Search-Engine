'''Edward Arnold Chapman''' (16 November 1914 – 11 December 1997) was an English criminal and wartime spy. During the [[Second World War]] he offered his services to [[Nazi Germany]] as a spy and subsequently became a British [[double agent]]. His [[British Secret Service]] handlers codenamed him ''Agent Zigzag'' in acknowledgement of his rather erratic personal history. 

He had a number of criminal aliases known by the British police, amongst them Edward Edwards, Arnold Thompson and Edward Simpson. His German codename was ''Fritz'' or, later, after endearing himself to his German contacts, its diminutive form of ''Fritzchen''.

==Background==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2016}}
Chapman was born on 16 November 1914 in [[Burnopfield]], [[County Durham]], England. His father was a former marine engineer who ended up as a [[Public house|publican]] in [[Roker]]. The family (Chapman was the eldest of three children) had a reputation for disobedience, and Chapman received little in the way of parental guidance. Despite being bright, he regularly played truant from school to go to the cinema and hang around the beach.&lt;ref name=Macintyre5/&gt;

Aged 17, Chapman joined the Second Battalion of the [[Coldstream Guards]], where his duties included guarding the [[Tower of London]].&lt;ref name=Macintyre5/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tallandier23/&gt; Chapman enjoyed the perks of the uniform, but soon became bored with his duties. After nine months in the army, having been granted six days of leave, he ran away with a girl he met in [[Soho, London|Soho]]. After two months the army caught up with him, and he was arrested and sentenced to 84 days in a military prison ([[Glasshouse (British Army)|glasshouse]]) at [[Aldershot]]. On release, Chapman received a dishonourable discharge from the army.&lt;ref name=Macintyre6/&gt;

Chapman returned to Soho and spent some time working casual jobs, from barman to film extra, but his lifestyle outstripped his earnings – gambling debts and a taste for fine alcohol soon left him broke. He slipped into petty crime, fraud and petty theft and, after several run-ins with the law, finally received his first civilian prison sentence, two months in [[HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs|Wormwood Scrubs]] for forging a cheque.&lt;ref name=Macintyre6/&gt; He became a [[safecracker]] with London [[West End of London|West End]] gangs, spending several stretches in jail for these crimes. The gangs utilised [[gelignite]] to gain entry to safes, leading Chapman and his associates to be known as the "Jelly Gang". One of Chapman's "Jelly Gang" crimes was carried out with the help of James Wells Hunt, whom Chapman met during a stint in prison. The execution of the crime involved Chapman disguising himself as a member of the [[Metropolitan Water Board (London)|Metropolitan Water Board]] in order to gain access to a house in [[Edgware Road]], from which he made his way into the shop next door by smashing through the wall. He then extracted the safe, which was transported to Hunt's Garage at 39 St Luke's Mews, where it had its door removed using gelignite.

Well along into his criminal career, he was arrested in Scotland and charged with blowing up the safe of the headquarters of the [[Edinburgh]] [[Co-operative Society]]. Let out on bail, he fled to [[Jersey]] in the [[Channel Islands]], where he unsuccessfully attempted to continue his criminal career.

Chapman had been dining with his lover and future fiancée Betty Farmer at the Hotel de la Plage immediately before his arrest and, when he saw plain-clothes police coming to arrest him for crimes on the mainland, made a spectacular exit through the dining room window (which was shut at the time). Later that same night he committed the slapdash burglary for which he had to immediately begin serving two years in a Jersey prison, which, ironically, spared him at least 14 more years' imprisonment in a mainland prison afterwards.

==Second World War==
Chapman was still in prison when the [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|Channel Islands were invaded by the Germans]].&lt;ref name=NationalArchives/&gt; While incarcerated he met [[Anthony Faramus]]. Following a letter in German which they concocted to get off the Island, they were transferred to [[Fort de Romainville]] in [[Paris]]. There, Chapman confirmed his willingness to act as a German spy. Under the direction of Captain Stephan von Gröning, head of the {{lang|de|[[Abwehr]]}} in [[Nantes]], he was trained in explosives, radio communications, parachute jumping and other subjects in France at [[La Bretonnière-la-Claye|La Bretonnière-la-Claye, Saint-Julien-des-Landes]], near Nantes, and dispatched to Britain to commit acts of sabotage.&lt;ref name=MI5/&gt;

On 16 December 1942, Chapman was flown to Britain in a [[Focke-Wulf]] bomber, converted for parachuting, from [[Le Bourget]] airfield.&lt;ref name=Macintyre102/&gt;&lt;ref name=obituaries&gt;Max Arthur, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-eddie-chapman-1137095.html ''Obituary: Eddie Chapman ''], The Independent, 6 January 1998&lt;/ref&gt; He was equipped with wireless, pistol, cyanide capsule and £1,000 and, amongst other things, was given the task of sabotaging the [[de Havilland]] aircraft factory at [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]].&lt;ref name=obituaries/&gt; After an uncomfortable flight, during which he suffered a nosebleed due to a poorly tightened oxygen mask, Chapman became stuck in the hatch as he tried to leave the aircraft. Finally detaching himself, he landed some distance from the target location of [[Mundford|Mundford, Norfolk]], near the village of [[Littleport, Cambridgeshire]].&lt;ref name=Macintyre102/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macintyre105/&gt;

[[File:Eddie Chapman (Agent ZigZag) double.jpg|thumb|Chapman filed by [[MI5]] on his arrival back from Germany]]
The British secret services had been aware of Chapman's existence for some time, via [[Ultra]] (decrypted German messages), and would know his date of departure. [[Section B1A]], the [[MI5]]-backed department which had the task of capturing enemy agents and turning them into double agents, had discussed the best method of capturing Chapman without revealing Ultra. In the end, Operation Nightcap was envisioned. Rather than conduct a full-scale manhunt, planes from [[RAF Fighter Command]] would trail Chapman's aircraft to identify his landing site (from one of three possible options). Local police would then be alerted, with instructions to conduct a search under the guise of looking for a deserter.&lt;ref name=Macintyre105/&gt; 

However, these plans were ultimately unnecessary; Chapman surrendered to the local police shortly after landing and offered his services to MI5.&lt;ref name=MI5/&gt; He was interrogated at [[Latchmere House]] in southwest London, better known as [[Camp 020]]. MI5 decided to use him as a [[double agent]] against the Germans and assigned [[Ronnie Reed]] as his case officer. (Reed had been invited to join MI5 in 1940 and remained until his retirement in 1976.)&lt;ref name=MI5/&gt;

===Faked sabotage of de Havilland factory===
{{main|Faked sabotage of De Havilland Factory}}
During the night of 29–30 January 1943, Chapman with MI5 officers faked a [[sabotage]] attack on his target, the [[de Havilland]] aircraft factory in Hatfield, where the [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] was being manufactured.&lt;ref name=MI5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/special-forces-obituaries/6789355/Eddie-Chapman.html Obituary], telegraph.co.uk; accessed 2 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; German reconnaissance aircraft photographed the site, and the faked damage convinced Chapman's German controllers that the attack had been successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moran |first1=Christopher |title=Classified : Secrecy and the State in Modern Britain |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=1107000998 |page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; MI5, to reinforce this story, also wrote and had a story published in the British newspaper the ''[[Daily Express]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mi5.gov.uk/eddie-chapman|title=Eddie Chapman {{!}} MI5 - The Security Service|website=www.mi5.gov.uk|access-date=2019-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the de Havilland subterfuge, B1A began preparations for Chapman's return to his German handlers. Radio messages were sent to the Abwehr requesting extraction by boat or submarine, and Chapman was set to work learning a cover story ready for the inevitable interrogations. However, the response from the Abwehr was lukewarm. They refused to send a [[U-Boat]] and told Chapman to return via [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]. This was not a simple method, as he had no valid reason to travel to the neutral port. Reed, and other members of B1A, believed this demonstrated the Germans' reluctance to pay Chapman the £15,000 he had been promised.&lt;ref name=Macintyre176/&gt; 

In the meantime Chapman was subjected to fake interrogation at Camp 020, to make sure his story held up. Reed told him to stick as close to the truth as possible, to help make the lies more realistic, and he was coached in speaking slowly to cover any hesitations. Stephens was impressed with how well Chapman responded to questioning.&lt;ref name=Macintyre176/&gt;

===Portugal and Operation Damp Squib===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
Unlike the Germans, MI5 was eager for Chapman to return, in the hope that, as a trusted asset, he could pick up significant information about the enemy. He was given the task of memorising a list of questions to which the Allies wanted answers. The list was carefully constructed so that, should Chapman be broken, its content would not show German intelligence the gaps in Allied knowledge.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

To get Chapman to [[Lisbon]], it was decided he would join the crew of a merchant ship, and jump ship when it docked in [[Portugal]]. A fake identity, Hugh Anson, was constructed and the relevant paperwork obtained before Chapman joined the crew of ''The City of Lancaster'', sailing out of [[Liverpool]]. On making contact with Germans at their Lisbon embassy, he suggested an attempt at blowing up the ship with a bomb disguised as a lump of coal to be placed in the coal bunker. This was in response to a request from Britain's anti-sabotage section that he obtain examples of German explosive devices. 

He was given two bombs, which, however, he handed to the ship's captain. The Germans did not notice the ship was not damaged on the voyage home,&lt;ref name=obituaries/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Macintyre on a BBC TV programme 15 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; but to avoid the Germans' doubting Chapman's commitment, the British staged a conspicuous investigation of the ship when it returned to Britain, ensuring gossip would make its way back to the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Macintyre (2007) p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman was sent to [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupied Norway]] to teach at a German spy school in [[Oslo]]. After a debriefing by von Gröning, Chapman was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] for his work in apparently damaging the de Havilland works and the ''City of Lancaster'', making him the first Englishman to receive such an award since the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71.&lt;ref name = MI5/&gt; However, Nicholas Booth&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Booth, Zigzag – The Incredible Wartime Exploits of Double Agent Eddie Chapman, 2007, Portrait, London ({{ISBN|0749951567}}) page 224&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that as the Iron Cross was only ever given to military personnel, Chapman's "Iron Cross" may instead have been a War Merit Cross 2nd Class, or ''[[War Merit Cross|Kriegsverdienstkreuz]]''. Chapman was inducted into the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] as an [[oberleutnant]] or first lieutenant.&lt;ref&gt;See Macintyre, 2007, pp 231 with photo and 286.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapman was also rewarded with 110,000 [[Reichsmark]]s and his own yacht.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1423826.stm How double agents duped the Nazis] [[BBC]] 5 July 2001&lt;/ref&gt; An MI5 officer wrote in an assessment "the Germans came to love Chapman&amp;nbsp;... but although he went cynically through all the forms, he did not reciprocate. Chapman loved himself, loved adventure, and loved his country, probably in that order".&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;Smith, Michael.[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/07/05/npro05.xml ZigZag, a womaniser and thief who double-crossed the Nazis], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 5 July 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; While in Oslo he also secretly photographed the German agents who stayed at his safe house.

===Return to London===
After [[Operation Overlord]] he was sent back to Britain to report on the accuracy of the [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]] weapon and the [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] antisubmarine weapon. He parachuted into [[Cambridgeshire]] on 29 June 1944 and went to London. Here he consistently reported to the Germans that the bombs were hitting their [[central London]] target, when in fact they were undershooting. Perhaps as a result of this disinformation, the Germans never corrected their aim, with the end result that most bombs landed in the [[south London]] suburbs or the [[Kent]] countryside, doing far less damage than they otherwise might have done.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Booth, Zigzag – The Incredible Wartime Exploits of Double Agent Eddie Chapman, 2007, Portrait, London ({{ISBN|0749951567}}), pp. 280-81.&lt;/ref&gt; 

During this period he was also involved in doping of dogs in [[greyhound racing]] and was associating with criminal elements in West End nightclubs. He was also indiscreet about the sources of his income and so MI5, being unable to control him, dismissed him on 2 November 1944.&lt;ref name = obituaries/&gt; Chapman was given a £6,000 payment from MI5 and was allowed to keep £1,000 of the money the Germans had given him. He was granted a pardon for his pre-war activities and was reported by MI5 to have been living "in fashionable places in London always in the company of beautiful women of apparent culture".&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;

==Love life==
[[File:Dagmar Lahlum 1922-1999.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dagmar Lahlum]] of the [[Norwegian resistance]]]]
Chapman had two fiancées at the same time, each in opposite war zones. He was still betrothed to Freda Stevenson in Britain when he met [[Dagmar Lahlum]] in [[Norway]]. Stevenson was being financially assisted through MI5, and Lahlum was being treated by von Gröning.&lt;ref name=Bloomsbury&gt;{{cite web |title=Edward Arnold Chapman – Agent 0747587949/ZIGZAG |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] |url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/media/ZIGZAGdossierfinal.pdf |accessdate=23 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219152503/http://www.bloomsbury.com/media/ZIGZAGdossierfinal.pdf |archivedate=19 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; During Chapman's stay in Norway, he revealed to Dagmar that he was a British agent, but fortunately Dagmar was linked to the Norwegian resistance. She was thrilled to know that her lover was not a German officer, and they worked together to gather German information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/32784702|title=BBC Timewatch Eddie Chapman on Vimeo|website=Vimeo.com|date=28 November 2011|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He abandoned both women after the war and instead married his former lover Betty Farmer, whom he had left in a hurry at the Hotel de la Plage in 1938. He and Farmer later had a daughter Suzanne in 1954. Dagmar served a six-month prison sentence for consorting with an apparently German officer: thinking that Chapman was dead, she was unable to prove that he was a British agent. They met again briefly in 1994. Chapman died before he was able to redeem her name.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==After the war==
[[File:Eddie Chapman with car.jpg|thumb|Chapman and his [[List of Rolls-Royce motor cars|Rolls-Royce]]]]
On his retirement, MI5 expressed some apprehension that Chapman might take up crime again when his money ran out and if caught would plead for leniency because of his highly secret wartime service. As predicted, he mixed with [[blackmail]]ers and thieves and got into trouble with the police for various crimes, including smuggling gold across the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Bletchley Park Trust Museum display on Eddie Chapman&lt;/ref&gt; More than once he had a character reference from former intelligence officers who confirmed his great contribution to the war effort.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Chapman had his wartime memoirs serialised in France to earn money, but he was charged under the [[Official Secrets Act]] and fined £50. A few years later, when they were due to be published in the ''[[News of the World]]'', the whole issue was pulped. However, his book ''The Eddie Chapman Story'' was eventually published in 1953.&lt;ref name = obituaries/&gt;

Chapman ghost-wrote the autobiography of [[Eric Pleasants]], a British citizen who joined the Germans and served in the [[British Free Corps]] of the [[Waffen-SS]] during the war. Chapman claimed to have met Pleasants while he was imprisoned in Jersey. ''I Killed to Live – The Story of Eric Pleasants as told to Eddie Chapman'' was published in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;''I Killed To Live - the Story of Eric Pleasants as Told to Eddie Chapman'' Cassell &amp; Company Ltd. 1957.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Chapman was living in [[Italy]] and went into business as an [[antiquarian]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Dumayet (Journalist: Pierre Dumayet, ''Eddie Chapman, ex-gangster, ex-espion.'' Serie: Cinq colonnes à la une. Producer.: JP Gallo. Broadcast 6 January 1967,) ''Eddie Chapman, ex-gangster, ex-espion.'' Producer: J-P Gallo. 6 January 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman and his wife later set up a [[health farm]] (Shenley Lodge, [[Shenley]], [[Hertfordshire|Herts]]) and owned a castle in [[Ireland]]. After the war Chapman remained friends with Baron Stephan von Gröning, his [[Abwehr]] handler (wartime alias Doctor Graumann),&lt;ref name=Bloomsbury/&gt; who had fallen on hard times. Von Gröning later attended the wedding of Chapman's daughter.&lt;ref name=obituaries/&gt; Eddie Chapman died of heart failure on 11 December 1997. He was survived by his wife Betty, and a daughter.&lt;ref name=obituaries/&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
In the 1950s producer Ted Banborough announced plans to make a film about Chapman starring [[Michael Rennie]] or [[Stanley Baker]], but this did not go ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12647037|title=Eddie Chapman may visit Sydney: Movie Plans For Ex-spy.|newspaper=[[The Sun-Herald|The Sun-Herald (Sydney, NSW: 1953–1954)]]|location=Sydney, NSW|date=7 November 1954|accessdate=19 May 2012|page=21|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He appeared as himself on the panel game show ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' in November 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Chapman, Bruce and Pemminger |url=http://www.ttttontheweb.com/ttttnighttimeguide.html |access-date=26 Oct 2016 |series=To Tell the Truth |date=8 November 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1966 film ''[[Triple Cross (1966 film)|Triple Cross]]'' was based on the biography ''The Real Eddie Chapman Story''&lt;ref&gt;Macintyre (2007 revised 2010) p318&lt;/ref&gt; co-written by Chapman and [[Frank Owen (politician)|Frank Owen]]. The film was directed by [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]], who had known Chapman before the war. Chapman's character was played by [[Christopher Plummer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0061647|Triple Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was only loosely based on reality, and Chapman was disappointed with it. In his autobiography, Plummer said that Chapman was to have been a technical adviser on the film, but the French authorities would not allow him in the country because he was still wanted over an alleged plot to kidnap the [[Sultan of Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;Plummer, Christopher ''In Spite of Myself: A Memoir'' 2008 Knopf&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1967 French TV ([[ORTF]]) produced a short film featuring a brief Chapman interview (in fluent [[French language|French]]). Journalist: {{ill|Pierre Dumayet|fr}}, ''Eddie Chapman, ex-gangster, ex-espion.'' Serie: Cinq colonnes à la une. Producer: JP Gallo.

In May 1989 Chapman made an [[After Dark (TV series)#Tony Benn and "Out of Bounds"|extended appearance]] on the [[Channel 4]] discussion programme ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'', alongside [[Tony Benn]], [[Hugh Trevor-Roper|Lord Dacre]], [[James Rusbridger]], [[Miles Copeland, Jr.|Miles Copeland]] and others. In 2011, [[BBC Two]] broadcast ''Double Agent: The Eddie Chapman Story'', a ''[[Timewatch]]'' documentary presented by [[Ben Macintyre]] based on his book.&lt;ref name=Macintyre2011/&gt; The book was broadcast in an abridged reading in 2012.
