For the majority of [[Christian denomination]]s, the '''Holy Spirit''', or '''Holy Ghost''', is the third person of the [[Trinity]]:&lt;ref name="Emery2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gilles Emery|title=The Trinity: An Introduction to Catholic Doctrine on the Triune God|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TjnangEACAAJ|year=2011|publisher=Catholic University of America Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1864-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Triune God manifested as [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]], and God the Holy Spirit; each entity itself being [[God in Christianity|God]].&lt;ref name=Erickson103&gt;{{cite book|author=Millard J.

[[Nontrinitarianism|Nontrinitarian]] Christians, who reject the doctrine of the Trinity, differ significantly from mainstream Christianity in [[Holy Spirit (Christian denominational variations)#Non-Trinitarian views|their beliefs about the Holy Spirit]]. In [[Christian theology]], [[pneumatology]] refers to the study of the [[Holy Spirit]]. Due to Christianity's historical relationship with Judaism, theologians often identify the Holy Spirit with the concept of the [[Holy Spirit in Judaism|''Ruach Hakodesh'']] in Jewish scripture, in the belief Jesus (who was Jewish) was expanding upon these Jewish concepts. Similar names, and ideas, include the ''Ruach [[Elohim]]'' (Spirit of God), ''Ruach YHWH'' (Spirit of [[Yahweh]]), and the ''Ruach Hakmah'' (Spirit of Wisdom).&lt;ref name="Cathechism 711-712"&gt;''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'': [https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P22.HTM Expectation of the Messiah and his Spirit (nos. 711–712)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parsons|first1=John|title=Hebrew names for God|url=http://www.hebrew4christians.com/Names_of_G-d/Holy_Spirit/holy_spirit.html|quote=The Holy Spirit as revealed in the Brit Chadashah}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the New Testament it is identified with the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Truth, the [[Paraclete]] and the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name= Millsxi /&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul pages 248-249"&gt;Grabe, Petrus J. ''The Power of God in Paul's Letters'' 2008 {{ISBN|978-3-16-149719-3}}, pp. 248–249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Truth pages 1-5"&gt;''Spirit of Truth: The origins of Johannine pneumatology'' by John Breck 1990 {{ISBN|0-88141-081-0}}, pages 1–5&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Testament details a close relationship between the Holy Spirit and [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] during his [[Ministry of Jesus|earthly life and ministry]].&lt;ref name=Scott208/&gt; The Gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] and the [[Nicene Creed]] state that Jesus was "conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the [[Virgin Mary]]".&lt;ref name=Erickson268/&gt; The Holy Spirit descended on Jesus like a dove during his [[baptism of Jesus|baptism]], and in his [[Farewell Discourse]] after the [[Last Supper]] Jesus promised to send the Holy Spirit to his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] after his departure.&lt;ref name=And442 /&gt;&lt;ref name=quest/&gt;

The Holy Spirit is referred to as "the Lord, the Giver of Life" in the [[Nicene Creed]], which summarises several key beliefs held by many Christian denominations. The participation of the Holy Spirit in the tripartite nature of conversion is apparent in Jesus' final [[post-resurrection appearances of Jesus|post-resurrection]] instruction to his disciples at the [[Great Commission|end of the Gospel of Matthew]] ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#28:19|28:19]]): "make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit," and "For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them."&lt;ref name="Lord page 5"&gt;''Lord, giver of life'' (Lona) by Jane Barter Moulaison 2006 {{ISBN|0-88920-501-9}} page 5&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first century, Christians have also called upon God with the [[trinitarian formula]] "Father, Son and Holy Spirit" in prayer, absolution and benediction.&lt;ref name="Vickers2"&gt;Vickers, Jason E.

==Etymology and usage==
The [[Koine Greek]] word ''pneûma'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|πνεῦμα}}}}, [[pneuma]]) is found around 385 times in the New Testament, with some scholars differing by three to nine occurrences.&lt;ref name=CompanionBible&gt;''Companion Bible–KJV–Large Print'' by [[E. W. Bullinger]], Kregel Publications, 1999. {{ISBN|0-8254-2099-7}}. Page 146.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pneuma'' appears 105 times in the four [[canonical gospel]]s, 69 times in the [[Acts of the Apostles]], 161 times in the [[Pauline epistles]], and 50 times elsewhere.&lt;ref name=CompanionBible/&gt; These usages vary: in 133 cases, it refers to "spirit" in a general sense and in 153 cases to "spiritual".{{clarify|date=June 2014}} Around 93 times, the reference to the Holy Spirit,&lt;ref name=CompanionBible/&gt; sometimes under the name ''pneuma'' and sometimes explicitly as the ''pneûma tò Hagion'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|Πνεῦμα}} {{linktext|τὸ}} {{linktext|Ἅγιον}}}}). (In a few cases it is also simply used generically to mean ''wind'' or ''life''.&lt;ref name=CompanionBible/&gt;) It was generally translated into the [[Vulgate]] as ''[[wikt:spiritus|Spiritus]]'' and ''{{linktext|Spiritus Sanctus}}''.

The [[English language|English]] terms "Holy Ghost" and "Holy Spirit" are complete synonyms: one derives from the [[Old English]] ''[[wikt:gast#Old English|gast]]'' and the other from the [[Latin]] [[loanword]] ''{{linktext|spiritus}}''. Like ''pneuma'', they both refer to the [[breath]], to its [[vitalism|animating power]], and to the [[soul]]. The Old English term is shared by all other [[Germanic languages]] (compare, e.g., the [[German language|German]] ''[[Geist]]'') and is older, but the [[King James Bible]] used both interchangeably, and 20th-century translations of the Bible overwhelmingly prefer "Holy Spirit", probably because the general English term "ghost" has increasingly come to refer only to the spirit of a dead person.&lt;ref&gt;Robin W. Lovin, Foreword to the English translation of Karl Barth's ''The Holy Spirit and the Christian Life'' (1993 {{ISBN|0-664-25325-3}}), page xvii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;q=Hustad+%22inside+a+white+sheet%22 Millard J.

==Biblical portrayal==
===Old Testament===
{{One source|section|date=June 2014}}
What the Hebrew Bible calls "Spirit of God" and "Spirit of Elohim" is called in the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]] "Holy Spirit" (''ruacḥ ha-kodesh''). Although the expression "Holy Spirit" occurs in Ps. 51:11 and in Isa. 63:10–11, it had not yet acquired quite the same meaning which was attached to it in rabbinical literature: in the latter it is equivalent to the expression "Spirit of the Lord". In Gen.1:2 God's spirit hovered over the form of lifeless matter, thereby making the Creation possible.&lt;ref&gt; See: Darshan, Guy, [https://www.academia.edu/41189353/Rua%E1%B8%A5_Elohim_in_Genesis_1_2_in_Light_of_Phoenician_Cosmogonies_A_Tradition_s_History_JNSL_45_2_2019_51_78 “Ruaḥ ’Elohim in Genesis 1:2 in Light of Phoenician Cosmogonies: A Tradition’s History,”] Journal of Northwest Semitic Languages 45,2 (2019), 51–78. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=je&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7833-holy-spirit "Holy Spirit", Jewish Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ''ruach ha-kodesh'' may be named instead of God, it was conceived of as being something distinct; and, like everything earthly that comes from heaven, the ''ruach ha-kodesh'' is composed of light and fire.&lt;ref name=je/&gt; The most characteristic sign of the presence of the ''ruach ha-kodesh'' is the gift of prophecy. The use of the word "ruach" (Hebrew: "breath", or "wind")  in the phrase ''ruach ha-kodesh'' seems to suggest that Judaic authorities believed the Holy Spirit was a kind of communication medium like the wind. The spirit talks sometimes with a masculine and sometimes with a feminine voice; the word ''ruacḥ'' is both masculine and feminine.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

===New Testament===
The term Holy Spirit appears at least 90 times in the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref name= Millsxi &gt;''Acts and Pauline writings'' by Watson E. Mills, Richard F. Wilson 1997 {{ISBN|0-86554-512-X}}, pages xl–xlx&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sacred]]ness of the Holy Spirit to Christians is affirmed in all three [[Synoptic Gospels]] ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#12:30|Matthew 12:30–32]], [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#3:28|Mark 3:28–30]] and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#12:8|Luke 12:8–10]]) which proclaim that [[blasphemy]] against the Holy Spirit is the [[unforgivable sin]].&lt;ref&gt;Blomberg, Craig L., ''Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey'', 2009 {{ISBN|0-8054-4482-3}}, page 280&lt;/ref&gt; The participation of the Holy Spirit in the [[Trinity]] is suggested in Jesus' final [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|post-Resurrection]] instruction to his disciples at the end of the Gospel of Matthew (28:19):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2028:19;&amp;version=ESV Matthew 28:19]&lt;/ref&gt; "Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit".&lt;ref name="Lord page 5"/&gt;

====Synoptic Gospels====
[[File:Philippe de Champaigne - Annunciation - WGA04705.jpg|thumb|190px|The Holy Spirit as a dove in the [[Annunciation]], by [[Philippe de Champaigne]], 1644]]
The Holy Spirit is mentioned by all three authors of the synoptic Gospels. Most of the references are by the author of the [[Gospel of Luke]]; this emphasis is continued by the same author in the [[Book of Acts]].

The Holy Spirit does not simply appear for the first time at [[Pentecost]] after the [[resurrection of Jesus]], but is present in the [[Gospel of Luke]] (in 1–2) prior to the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|birth of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Millsxi /&gt; In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#1:15|Luke 1:15]], [[John the Baptist]] was said to be "filled with the Holy Spirit" prior to birth, and the Holy Spirit came upon the [[Virgin Mary]] in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#1:35|Luke 1:35]].&lt;ref name=Millsxi /&gt; In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:16|Luke 3:16]] John the Baptist stated that Jesus baptized not with water but with the Holy Spirit; and the Holy Spirit descended on Jesus during his [[baptism of Jesus|baptism]] in the Jordan River.&lt;ref name=Millsxi /&gt; In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#11:13|Luke 11:13]] Jesus provided assurances that [[God the Father]] would "give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him".&lt;ref name=Millsxi /&gt;

[[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#13:11|Mark 13:11]] specifically refers to the power of the Holy Spirit to act and speak through the disciples of Jesus in time of need: "be not anxious beforehand what ye shall speak: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye; for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Spirit." [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#10:20|Matthew 10:20]] refers to the same act of speaking through the disciples, but uses the term "Spirit of your Father".&lt;ref&gt;''The Gospel of Luke'' by Luke Timothy Johnson, Daniel J. Harrington 1992 {{ISBN|0-8146-5805-9}}, page 195&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Acts of the Apostles=====
{{Main article|Holy Spirit in the Acts of the Apostles}}
The [[Acts of the Apostles]] has sometimes been called the "Book of the Holy Spirit" or the "Acts of the Holy Spirit".&lt;ref name=Johnson14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Couch120 &gt;''A Bible Handbook to the Acts of the Apostles'' by Mal Couch 2004 {{ISBN|0-8254-2391-0}}, pages 120–129&lt;/ref&gt; Of the seventy or so occurrences of the word ''Pneuma'' in Acts, fifty-five refer to the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name=Couch120 /&gt;

From the start, in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#1:2|Acts 1:2]], the reader is reminded that the [[ministry of Jesus]], while he was on earth, was carried out through the power of the Holy Spirit and that the "acts of the apostles" continue the acts of Jesus and are also facilitated by the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name=Couch120 /&gt; Acts presents the Holy Spirit as the "life principle" of the [[Early Christianity|early Church]] and provides five separate and dramatic instances of its outpouring on believers in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#2:1|2:1–4]], [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#4:28|4:28–31]], [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#8:15|8:15–17]], [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#10:44|10:44]] and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#19:6|19:6]].&lt;ref name=Johnson14 &gt;''The Acts of the Apostles'' by Luke Timothy Johnson, Daniel J. Harrington 1992 {{ISBN|0-8146-5807-5}}, pages 14–18&lt;/ref&gt;

References to the Holy Spirit appear throughout Acts, for example [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#1:5|Acts 1:5 and 8]] stating towards the beginning: "For John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit&amp;nbsp;... ye shall receive power, when the Holy Spirit is come upon you" referring to the fulfillment of the prophecy of [[John the Baptist]] in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:16|Luke 3:16]]: "he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit".&lt;ref&gt;''Reading Acts: A Literary and Theological Commentary on the Acts of the Apostles'' by Charles H. Talbert 2005 {{ISBN|1-57312-277-7}}, pages 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

====Johannine literature====
{{Main article|Holy Spirit in Johannine literature}}
Three separate terms, namely ''Holy Spirit'', ''Spirit of Truth'' and ''Paraclete'' are used in the [[Johannine writings]].&lt;ref name="Truth pages 1-5"/&gt; The "Spirit of Truth" is used in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#14:17|John 14:17]], [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#15:26|15:26]] and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#16:13|16:13]].&lt;ref name= Millsxi /&gt; The [[First Epistle of John]] then contrasts this with the "spirit of error" in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 John#4:6|1 John 4:6]].&lt;ref name=Millsxi /&gt; 1 John 4:1–6 provides the separation between spirits "that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God" and those who in error refuse it—an indication of their being evil spirits.&lt;ref&gt;''1, 2, and 3 John'' by John Painter, Daniel J. Harrington 2002 {{ISBN|0-8146-5812-1}}, page 324&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#14:26|John 14:26]] Jesus states: "But the Comforter, [even] the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things". The identity of the "Comforter" has been the subject of debate among theologians, who have proposed multiple theories on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;''The anointed community: the Holy Spirit in the Johannine tradition'' by Gary M. Burge 1987 {{ISBN|0-8028-0193-5}}, pages 14–21&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pauline epistles====
{{Main article|Holy Spirit in the Pauline epistles}}
[[File:Holy Spirit as Dove (detail).jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Stained glass]] representation of the Holy Spirit as a dove, c. 1660.]]
The Holy Spirit plays a key role in the [[Pauline epistles]]; and the [[Apostle Paul]]'s pneumatology is closely connected to his theology and [[Christology]], to the point of being almost inseparable from them.&lt;ref name="Paul pages 248-249"/&gt;

The [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians]], which was likely the first of Paul's letters, introduces a characterization of the Holy Spirit in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Thessalonians#1:6|1:6]] and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Thessalonians#4:8|4:8]] which is found throughout his epistles.&lt;ref name=Dunn418 &gt;''Theology of Paul the Apostle'' by James D. G. Dunn 2003 {{ISBN|0-567-08958-4}}, pages 418–420&lt;/ref&gt; In 1 Thessalonians 1:6 Paul refers to the [[imitation of Christ]] (and himself) and states: "And ye became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit", whose source is identified in 1 Thessalonians 4:8 as "God, who giveth his Holy Spirit unto you".&lt;ref name=Dunn418 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins &gt;''A Concise Dictionary of Theology'' by Gerald O'Collins, Edward G.

Jestice 2004 {{ISBN|1-57607-355-6}}, pages 393–394&lt;/ref&gt;

These two themes of receiving the Spirit "like Christ" and God being the source of the Spirit persist in Pauline letters as the characterization of the relationship of Christians with God.&lt;ref name=Dunn418 /&gt; For Paul the ''[[imitation of Christ]]'' involves readiness to be shaped by the Holy Spirit, as in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Romans#8:4|Romans 8:4]] and 8:11: "But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead shall give life also to your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwelleth in you."&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt;

The First Epistle to the Thessalonians also refers to the power of the Holy Spirit in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Thessalonians#1:5|1:5]], a theme also found in other Pauline letters.&lt;ref&gt;''1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians'' by Jon A. Weatherly 1996 {{ISBN|0-89900-636-1}}, pages 42–43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mainstream doctrines==
{{see also|Pneumatology (Christianity)}}

The theology of spirits is called pneumatology. The Holy Spirit is referred to as the Lord and Giver of Life in the [[Nicene creed]].&lt;ref name=Colin280&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Christian Doctrine'' by Colin E. Gunton (Jun 28, 1997) {{ISBN|0-521-47695-X}}, pages 280–285&lt;/ref&gt; He is The Creator Spirit, present before the creation of the universe and through his power everything was made in [[Jesus Christ]], by [[God the Father]].&lt;ref name=Colin280/&gt; Christian [[hymn]]s such as ''[[Veni Creator Spiritus]]'' reflects this belief.&lt;ref name=Colin280/&gt;

In [[early Christianity]], the concept of salvation was closely related to the invocation of the "Father, Son and Holy Spirit".&lt;ref name="Vickers2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=PCPhan3/&gt; and since the first century, Christians have called upon God with the name "Father, Son and Holy Spirit" in prayer, baptism, communion, exorcism, hymn-singing, preaching, confession, absolution and benediction.&lt;ref name="Vickers2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=PCPhan3/&gt; This is reflected in the saying: "Before there was a 'doctrine' of the Trinity, Christian prayer invoked the Holy Trinity".&lt;ref name="Vickers2"/&gt;

For the majority of Christian denominations, the Holy Spirit is the third Person of the [[Holy Trinity]]—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and is Almighty [[God in Christianity|God]].&lt;ref name="Erickson103"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cathhs&gt;{{cite web|title=Catholic Encyclopedia:Holy Spirit|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07409a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Holy Spirit is understood to be one of the three ''persons'' of the [[Trinity]]. As such he is personal and also fully God, co-equal and co-eternal with [[God the Father]] and [[Son of God]].&lt;ref name="Erickson103" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cathhs"/&gt; He is different from the Father and the Son in that he ''proceeds'' from the Father (and, according to [[Roman Catholics]], [[Old Catholics]], [[Anglicans]], and [[Protestants]], [[Filioque|from the Father and the Son]]) as described in the [[Nicene Creed]].&lt;ref name=Hammond/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mystici_Corporis_Christi&gt;{{cite book|title=Mystici Corporis Christi|author=Pope Pius XII|year=1943|url=http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius12/P12MYSTI.HTM#fn39|access-date=2011-04-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824013354/http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius12/P12MYSTI.HTM#fn39|archive-date=2011-08-24|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Triune God is thus manifested as three ''Persons'' ([[Koine Greek|Greek]] ''[[hypostasis (religion)|hypostases]]''),&lt;ref name=Catholic_Encyclopedia&gt;See discussion in {{CathEncy|wstitle=Person}}&lt;/ref&gt; in One Divine Being ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[Ousia]]),&lt;ref name="Systematic_theology"/&gt; called the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]] (''&lt;small&gt;from Old English:&lt;/small&gt; Godhood''), the Divine Essence of God.&lt;ref name=Catholic_Catechism_Trinity&gt;''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church|CCC]]'': [https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P17.HTM#1FT The Dogma of the Holy trinity].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New Testament, by the power of the Holy Spirit Jesus was conceived in the womb of the [[Virgin Mary]], while [[Virgin birth of Jesus|maintaining her virginity]].&lt;ref name="Luke 1:35"&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%201:35;&amp;version=ESV; Luke 1:35]&lt;/ref&gt; The Holy Spirit descended over Jesus in a corporeal way, as a dove, at the time of [[Baptism of Jesus|his baptism]], and a voice from Heaven was heard: "This is my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased."&lt;ref name="Harrington38"&gt;Harrington, Daniel J., SJ. "Jesus Goes Public." ''America,'' Jan. 7–14, 2008, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrington38" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2c|Mt|3:17}} {{bibleref2c|Mk|1:11}} {{bibleref2c|Lk|3:21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the Sanctifier of souls, the Helper,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2015:26;&amp;version=ESV; John 15:26]&lt;/ref&gt; Comforter,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2014:16;&amp;version=ESV; John 14:16]&lt;/ref&gt; the Giver of graces, he who leads souls to the Father and the Son.&lt;ref name=Colin280/&gt;

The Holy Spirit is credited with inspiring believers and allowing for them to interpret all the sacred scripture and leads prophets, both in [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;''Theology for the Community of God'' by Stanley J. Grenz (Jan 31, 2000) {{ISBN|0-8028-4755-2}} page 380&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christians]] receive the [[Fruits of the Holy Spirit]] by means of his [[Mercy#Christianity|mercy]] and [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]].&lt;ref&gt;''Baptism in the Early Church: History, Theology, and Liturgy in the First Five Centuries'' by Everett Ferguson (Mar 29, 2009) {{ISBN|0-8028-2748-9}}, page 776&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian doctrine of the [[Trinity]] includes the concept of God the Holy Spirit, along with [[God the Son]] and [[God the Father]].&lt;ref&gt;''Systematic Theology'' by Lewis Sperry Chafer 1993 {{ISBN|0-8254-2340-6}}, page 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiersbe471 &gt;''The Wiersbe Bible Commentary: The Complete New Testament'' by Warren W. Wiersbe 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-7814-4539-9}}, page 471&lt;/ref&gt; Theologian [[Vladimir Lossky]] has argued that while in the act of the [[Incarnation]], ''God the Son'' became manifest as the [[Son of God]], the same did not take place for ''God the Holy Spirit'' which remained unrevealed.&lt;ref name=Donnell &gt;''The mystery of the Triune God'' ... Whatever, therefore, is spoken of God in respect to Himself, is both spoken singly of each person, that is, of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; and together of the Trinity itself, not plurally but in the singular. by John Joseph O'Donnell 1988 {{ISBN|0-7220-5760-1}} page 75&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, as in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#6:19|1 Corinthians 6:19]], God the Spirit continues to dwell in bodies of the faithful.&lt;ref name=Wiersbe471 /&gt;

In a similar way, the Latin treatise ''De Trinitate'' (''[[On the Trinity]]'') of Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]] affirms: "For as the Father is God, and the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God, which no one doubts to be said in respect to substance, yet we do not say that the very Supreme Trinity itself is three Gods, but one God... But position, and condition, and places, and times, are not said to be in God properly, but [[Metaphor#As a foundation of our conceptual system|metaphorically]] and through [[Analogy#Religion|similitudes]]... And as respects action (or making), perhaps it may be said most truly of God alone, for God alone makes and Himself is not made. Nor is He liable to passions as far as belongs to that substance whereby He is God... So the Father is omnipotent, the Son omnipotent, and the Holy Spirit is omnipotent; yet not three omnipotents, but one [[Omnipotence#Meanings|omnipotent]]... Whatever, therefore, is spoken of God in respect to Himself, is both spoken singly of each [[Personal identity#Continuity of substance|Person]], that is, of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; and together of the Trinity itself, not plurally but in the singular.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/130105.htm | title = ''De Trinitate'', Book V, chapter 8 | website = newadvent.org | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/19991013043702/http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/130105.htm | archive-date = October 13, 1999 | url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christian theology the Holy Spirit is believed to perform specific divine functions in the life of the Christian or the church. The action of the Holy Spirit is seen as an essential part of the bringing of the person to the Christian faith.&lt;ref name=Erickson265&gt;{{cite book|author=Millard J. Erickson|year=1992|title=Introducing Christian Doctrine.|publisher=Baker Book House|pages=265–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new believer is "born again of the Spirit".&lt;ref&gt;Though the term "[[Born again (Christianity)|born again]]" is most frequently used by evangelical Christians, most denominations do consider that the new Christian is a "new creation" and "born again". See for example the Catholic Encyclopedia [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02258b.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The Holy Spirit enables Christian life by dwelling in the individual believers and enables them to live a righteous and faithful life.&lt;ref name=Erickson265/&gt; The Holy Spirit also acts as comforter or [[Paraclete]], one who intercedes, or supports or acts as an advocate, particularly in times of trial. And he acts to convince the unredeemed person both of the sinfulness of their actions, and of their moral standing as sinners before God.&lt;ref&gt;''The Holy Spirit and His Gifts''. [[J. Oswald Sanders]]. Inter-Varsity Press. chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Another faculty of the Holy Spirit is the inspiration and interpretation of scripture. The Holy Spirit both ''inspires'' the writing of the scriptures and ''interprets'' them to the Christian and the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=T C Hammond, Revised and edited by David F Wright|year=1968|title=In Understanding be Men:A Handbook of Christian Doctrine.|edition=sixth|publisher=[[Inter-Varsity Press]]|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procession of the Holy Spirit===
{{Main article|History of the Filioque controversy|Eastern Orthodox teachings regarding the Filioque}}
In {{bibleverse||John|15:26}} Jesus says of the Holy Spirit: "But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me." In 325, the [[First Council of Nicaea]], being the first ecumenical council, ended its [[Nicene Creed|Creed]] with the words "and in the Holy Spirit". In 381, the [[First Council of Constantinople]], being the second ecumenical council, expanded the Creed and stated that Holy Spirit "proceeds from the Father" (ἐκ τοῦ Πατρὸς ἐκπορευόμενον). This phrase was based on {{bibleverse||John|15:26}} (ὃ παρὰ τοῦ πατρὸς ἐκπορεύεται). In 451, the [[Council of Chalcedon]], being the fourth ecumenical council, affirmed the [[Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed]].{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989|pp=}} In the same time, the question of procession of the Holy Spirit was addressed by various Christian theologians, expressing diverse views and using different terminology, thus initiating the debate that became focused on the [[Filioque]] clause.

In 589, the [[Third Council of Toledo]] in its third canon officially accepted the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son ("a Patre et Filio procedere").{{sfn|Martínez-Díez|Rodriguez|1992|p=79}} During the next few centuries, two distinctive schools of thought were gradually shaped, Eastern and Western. Eastern theologians were teaching that Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father only (notion referred as ''monoprocessionism''),{{sfn|Wilhite|2009||pp=285-302}} while Western theologians were teaching that Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (notion referred as ''filioquism'').{{sfn|Phillips|1995||pp=60}} Debates and controversies between two sides became the main point of difference within the Christian [[pneumatology]].

[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P67.HTM#$211 1830–32].&lt;/ref&gt; consists of "permanent dispositions"&lt;ref name=CCC /&gt; (in this similar to the permanent character of the [[sacrament]]s), virtuous characteristics engendered in the Christian by the action of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name=fung262&gt;''The Epistle to the Galatians'' (The New International Commentary on the New Testament) by [[Ronald Y. K. Fung]] (Jul 22, 1988) Wm. B.

&lt;blockquote&gt;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control; against such there is no law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the Epistle to the Galatians these nine characteristics are in contrast to the "works of the flesh" and highlight the positive manifestations of the work of the Holy Spirit in believers.&lt;ref name=fung262/&gt;

The "[[gifts of the Holy Spirit]]"&lt;ref name=CCC /&gt; are distinct from the Fruit of the Spirit, and consist of specific abilities granted to the individual Christian.&lt;ref name=Erickson265/&gt; They are frequently known by the Greek word for gift, ''[[wikt:charisma|charisma]]'', in English [[charism]], from which the term [[charismatic]] derives. There is no generally agreed upon exhaustive list of the gifts, and various Christian denominations use different lists, often drawing upon [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#12|12]], [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Romans#12|12]] and [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Ephesians#4|4]].&lt;ref name=EricksonWorks/&gt; [[Pentecostal]] denominations and the charismatic movement teach that the absence of the supernatural gifts was due to the neglect of the Holy Spirit and his work by the major denominations.&lt;ref name=EricksonWorks/&gt; Believers in the relevance of the supernatural gifts sometimes speak of a ''[[Baptism with the Holy Spirit]]'' or ''Filling with the Holy Spirit'' which the Christian needs to experience in order to receive those gifts. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Tozer | first=A.

The "[[seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]]"&lt;ref name=CCC /&gt; pour out on a believer at [[baptism]], and are traditionally derived from [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Isaiah#11|11:1–2]], although the New Testament does not refer to Isaiah 11:1–2 regarding these gifts.&lt;ref name=EricksonWorks/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaw457&gt;{{cite book|first1=Russell|last1=Shaw|first2=Peter M.

==Denominational variations==
{{Main article|Holy Spirit (Christian denominational variations)}}
[[File:Nicaea icon.jpg|thumb|140px|left|[[Icon]] of the Fathers of the Council holding the [[Nicene Creed]]]]
Christian denominations have doctrinal variations in their beliefs regarding the Holy Spirit. A well-known example is the ''[[Filioque]]'' controversy regarding the Holy Spirit – one of the key differences between the teachings of the main [[Western Church]]es and various [[Eastern Christian]] denominations ([[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Church of the East]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kasper|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Kasper |title=The Petrine ministry. Catholics and Orthodox in Dialogue: Academic Symposium Neld at the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=978-0-8091-4334-4|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kinnamon|first1=Michael|last2=Cope|first2=Brian E.|title=The Ecumenical Movement: An Anthology of Key Texts and Voices|year=1997|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-4263-3|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Filioque'' debate centers around whether the [[Nicene Creed]] should state that the Spirit "proceeds from the Father" and then have a stop, as the creed was initially adopted in Greek (and followed thereafter by the Eastern Church), or should say "from the Father and the Son" as was later adopted in Latin and followed by the Western Church, ''filioque'' being "and from the Son" in Latin.&lt;ref name=Rogers81&gt;''The Holy Spirit: Classic and Contemporary Readings'' by Eugene F. Rogers Jr. (May 19, 2009) Wiley {{ISBN|1-4051-3623-5}}, page 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 20th century, discussions took place about the removal of ''Filioque'' in the Nicene Creed from [[Anglican]] prayer books along the lines of the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox approach, but these still have not reached a state of final implementation.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Theology'' by Owen C. Thomas and [[Ellen K. Wondra]] (Jul 1, 2002) {{ISBN|0-8192-1897-9}}, page 221&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of mainstream [[Protestantism]] hold similar views on the theology of the Holy Spirit as the Roman Catholic Church, but there are significant differences in belief between [[Pentecostalism]] and the rest of Protestantism.&lt;ref name="Erickson103"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Watson39&gt;{{cite book|author=[[David Watson (evangelist)|David Watson]]|title=One in the Spirit|year=1973|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|pages=39–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pentecostalism has a focus on "Baptism with the Spirit", relying on Acts 1:5 which refers to "now you will baptize with the Holy Spirit".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Protestantism'' by J. Gordon Melton 2008 {{ISBN|0-8160-7746-0}}, page 69&lt;/ref&gt; The more recent Charismatic movements have a focus on the "gifts of the Spirit" (such as healing, prophecy, etc.) and rely on 1 Corinthians 12 as a scriptural basis, but often differ from Pentecostal movements.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Protestantism'' by J. Gordon Melton 2008 {{ISBN|0-8160-7746-0}}, page 134&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nontrinitarianism#Holy Spirit|Non-trinitarian views about the Holy Spirit]] differ significantly from mainstream Christian doctrine.

===Catholicism===
The Holy Spirit has been a topic in at least two papal encyclicals:
* [[Divinum illud munus]] - [[Pope Leo XIII]] (1897)
* [[Dominum et vivificantem]] - [[Pope John Paul II]] (1986)

The topic of the Holy Spirit is discussed extensively in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] as "I believe in the Holy Spirit" in Paragraphs 683 through 747.

The doctrine of the Holy Spirit as expressed in the [[Nicene Creed]] has been a point of difference between the Catholic Church and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].  See [[Filioque]] clause.

===Jehovah's Witnesses and Christadelphians===
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Christadelphians]] view the Holy Spirit, not as an actual person separate from God the Father, but as God's eternal "energy" or "active force", that he uses to accomplish his will in creation and redemption.&lt;ref name="Awake!

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] believe that the Holy Ghost is the third member of the [[God in Mormonism|Godhead]]. He is a personage of spirit, without a body of flesh and bones.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.22 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]&lt;/ref&gt; He is often referred to as the Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Lord, or the Comforter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/shared/content/english/pdf/language-materials/36863_eng.pdf "True to the Faith", p. 81.]&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Church believe in a [[social trinitarianism]] and [[subordinationism]], meaning that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are understood as being unified in will and purpose, but not in substance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/youth/article/learning-about-the-godhead?lang=eng "Learning about the Godhead"]&lt;/ref&gt; The Holy Ghost is believed to be subordinate to the Father and the Son and operates under their direction. The Holy Ghost, like all intelligent beings, is believed to be fundamentally eternal, uncreated, and self-existent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.29?lang=eng The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church teaches that the influence of the Holy Ghost can be received before baptism, but the gift, or constant companionship, of the Holy Ghost, which comes by the laying-on of hands by a properly ordained Priesthood Holder with a line of authority traced back to Christ through Peter, is obtained only after baptism.&lt;ref&gt;http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Holy_Ghost&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Smith]], the founding prophet of the Church, taught "You might as well baptize a bag of sand as a man," he said, "if not done in view of the remission of sins and getting of the Holy Ghost. Baptism by water is but half a baptism, and is good for nothing without the other half-that is, the baptism of the Holy Ghost".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (book)|TPJS]]'', p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stoic philosophy ==
{{One source|section|date=June 2017}}
In his Introduction to the 1964 book ''[[Meditations]]'', the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth discussed the profound impact of [[Stoicism]] on [[Christianity]]. In particular:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Another Stoic concept which offered inspiration to the Church was that of 'divine Spirit'. [[Cleanthes]], wishing to give more explicit meaning to [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno's]] 'creative fire', had been the first to hit upon the term ''pneuma'', or 'spirit', to describe it. Like fire, this intelligent 'spirit' was imagined as a tenuous substance akin to a current of air or breath, but essentially possessing the quality of warmth; it was immanent in the universe as God, and in man as the soul and life-giving principle. Clearly it is not a long step from this to the 'Holy Spirit' of Christian theology, the 'Lord and Giver of life', visibly manifested as tongues of fire at Pentecost and ever since associated – in the Christian as in the Stoic mind – with the ideas of vital fire and beneficient warmth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://archive.org/details/meditations0000marc_m9z0 |url-access=registration |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/meditations0000marc_m9z0/page/25 25] |id={{ISBN|978-0-140-44140-6}} |isbn=0-14044140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Symbolism and art==

===Symbolism===
[[File:Faroe stamp 537 jolavisan.jpg|thumb|130px|The Holy Spirit as a dove on a stamp from [[Faroe Islands]].]]
The Holy Spirit is frequently referred to by metaphor and [[Christian symbolism|symbol]], both doctrinally and biblically. Theologically speaking these symbols are a key to understanding of the Holy Spirit and his actions, and are not mere artistic representations.&lt;ref name=cathhs/&gt;&lt;ref name=watsonsym&gt;{{cite book|title=One in the Spirit|author=[[David Watson (evangelist)|David Watson]]|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|year=1973|pages=20–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Water – signifies the Holy Spirit's action in Baptism, such that in the manner that "by one Spirit [believers] were all baptized", so they are "made to drink of one Spirit".{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|12:13||1Cor 12:13}} Thus the Spirit is also personally the living water welling up from Christ crucified{{Bibleref2c|John|19:34||Jn 19:34}}{{Bibleref2c|1John|5:8||1 Jn 5:8}} as its source and welling up in Christians to eternal life.&lt;ref name=watsonsym/&gt;&lt;ref name=catechism&gt;''CCC'': [https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c3a8.htm#II Symbols of the Holy Spirit (nos. 694–701)].&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', item 1137, considers the [[Water of Life (Christianity)|Water of Life]] reference in the [[Book of Revelation]] ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#21:6|21:6]] and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#22:1|22:1]]) "one of most beautiful symbols of the Holy Spirit".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s1c2a1.htm Vatican website: ''Catechism'' item 1137]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anointing – The symbolism of bless with oil also signifies the Holy Spirit, to the point of becoming a synonym for the Holy Spirit. The coming of the Spirit is referred to as his "anointing".{{Bibleref2c|2Co|1:21||2Cor 1:21}} In some denominations anointing is practiced in Confirmation; ("chrismation" in the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Churches]]). Its full force can be grasped only in relation to the primary anointing accomplished by the Holy Spirit, that of Jesus. The title "[[Christ]]" (in Hebrew, ''messiah'') means the one "anointed" by God's Spirit.&lt;ref name=watsonsym/&gt;&lt;ref name=catechism/&gt;
* Fire – symbolizes the transforming energy of the Holy Spirit's actions. In the form of tongues "as of fire", the Holy Spirit rested on the disciples on the morning of Pentecost.&lt;ref name=watsonsym/&gt;&lt;ref name=catechism/&gt;
* Cloud and light – The Spirit comes upon the Virgin Mary and "overshadows" her, so that she might conceive and give birth to Jesus. On the mountain of transfiguration, the Spirit in the "cloud came and overshadowed" Jesus, Moses and Elijah, Peter, James and John, and "a voice came out of the cloud, saying, 'This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!'"&lt;ref name=catechism/&gt;{{Bibleref2c|Lk|9:34–35||Lk 9:34–35}}
* The dove – When Christ comes up from the water of his baptism, the Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, comes down upon him and remains with him.&lt;ref name=watsonsym/&gt;&lt;ref name=catechism/&gt;{{Bibleref2c|Mt|3:16||Mt 3:16}}
* Wind – The Spirit is likened to the "wind that blows where it will,"{{Bibleref2c|Jn|3:8||Jn 3:8}} and described as "a sound from heaven like the rush of a mighty wind."{{Bibleref2c|Ac|2:2–4||Acts 2:24}}&lt;ref name=watsonsym/&gt;

The Holy Spirit has been represented in [[Christian art]] both in the [[Eastern Church|Eastern]] and [[Western Church]]es using a variety of depictions.&lt;ref name=Earls70 &gt;''Renaissance Art: A Topical Dictionary'' by Irene Earls 1987 {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}}, page 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gardner349 &gt;''Gardner's Art Through the Ages: The Western Perspective'' by Fred S. Kleiner {{ISBN|0-495-57355-8}}, page 349&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lossky &gt;Vladimir Lossky, 1999 ''The Meaning of Icons'' {{ISBN|0-913836-99-0}}, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; The depictions have ranged from nearly identical figures that represent the three persons of the [[Holy Trinity]] to a dove to a flame.

The Holy Spirit is often depicted as a [[dove]], based on the account of the Holy Spirit descending on [[Jesus]] like a dove when he was baptized in the [[Jordan River|Jordan]].&lt;ref name=Joel14/&gt; In many paintings of the [[Annunciation]], the Holy Spirit is shown in the form of a dove, coming down towards Mary on beams of light, as the [[Archangel]] Gabriel announces [[Jesus Christ]]'s coming to [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]]. A dove may also be seen at the ear of [[Saint Gregory the Great]]─as recorded by his secretary or other church father authors, dictating their works to them. The dove also parallels the one that brought the olive branch to [[Noah]] after the deluge, as a symbol of peace.&lt;ref name=Joel14&gt;''We Believe in the Holy Spirit'' (Ancient Christian Doctrine, No. 4) by Joel C. Elowsky (Jul 13, 2009) InterVarsity {{ISBN|0-8308-2534-7}}, page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The book of Acts describes the Holy Spirit descending on the [[twelve apostles|apostles]] at Pentecost in the form of a wind and tongues of fire resting over the apostles' heads. Based on the imagery in that account, the Holy Spirit is sometimes symbolized by a flame of fire.&lt;ref name=Eugene121&gt;''The Holy Spirit: Classic and Contemporary Readings'' by Eugene F. Rogers Jr. (May 19, 2009) Wiley {{ISBN|1-4051-3623-5}}, pages 121–123&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic Christians]] depicted the Holy Spirit as a goose called Ah Geadh-Glas, which means wild goose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.circleofhope.net/benwhite/tag/ah-geadh-glas/|title=Ah Geadh-Glas Archives|website=Today, if you hear his voice|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gotquestions.org/Celtic-Christianity.html|title=What is Celtic Christianity?|website=GotQuestions.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A goose was chosen rather than the traditional dove because geese were perceived as more free than their dove counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www1.cbn.com/biblestudy/christians-on-a-wild-goose-chase|title=Christians on a Wild Goose Chase|date=2013-09-25|website=CBN.com - The Christian Broadcasting Network|language=en|access-date=2020-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Downs|first=Annie|title=Remember God|publisher=B&amp;H Publishing Group|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote="But did you also know that Celtic Christians call the Holy Spirit Ah Geadh-Glas, which means "Wild Goose"?
