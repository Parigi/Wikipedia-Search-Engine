In 1976, he co-founded [[Apple Inc.]], which later became the [[list of the largest information technology companies|world's largest information technology company]] by revenue and the [[list of public corporations by market capitalization|largest company in the world by market capitalization]]. Through their work at Apple in the 1970s and 1980s, he and Apple co-founder [[Steve Jobs]] are widely recognized as two prominent pioneers of the [[History of personal computers|personal computer revolution]].

In 1975, Wozniak started developing the [[Apple I|Apple&amp;nbsp;I]]&lt;ref name="iWoz" /&gt;{{rp|page=150|quote=After my first meeting, I started designing the computer that would later be known as the Apple I.

He then pursued several other businesses and philanthropic ventures throughout his career, focusing largely on technology in [[K–12]] schools.&lt;ref name=wozorg/&gt;

{{As of|November 2019}}, Wozniak has remained an employee of Apple in a ceremonial capacity since stepping down in 1985.&lt;ref name="wozemployee"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Steve Wozniak on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/stevewoz/status/1193424787248279552 |website=Twitter |accessdate=November 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steve Wozniak was born and raised in [[San Jose, California]], the son of Margaret Louise Wozniak (née Kern) (1923–2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wc.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=dowfam3&amp;id=I191886|title=RootsWeb's WorldConnect Project: Dowling Family Genealogy|website=wc.rootsweb.com}}{{unreliable source?|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Washington (state)|Washington state]]&lt;ref name="iWoz" /&gt;{{rp|page=18}} and Francis Jacob "Jerry" Wozniak (1925–1994) from [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name="iWoz" /&gt;{{rp|page=18}} His father, Jerry Wozniak, was an engineer for [[Lockheed Corporation]].&lt;ref name="Apple Confidential"/&gt;{{rp|page=1}} He graduated from [[Homestead High School (Cupertino, California)|Homestead High School]] in 1968, in [[Cupertino, California]].

The name on Wozniak's birth certificate is "Stephan Gary Wozniak", but his mother said that she intended it to be spelled "Stephen," which is what he uses.&lt;ref name="iWoz" /&gt;{{rp|page=18}} Wozniak has mentioned his surname being [[Ukrainian surnames|Ukrainian]]&lt;ref name="wozorg-polish"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.woz.org/category/tags/poland |title=About your last name |last=Wozniak |first=Steve |website=Woz.org |accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://tsn.ua/ukrayina/zavzhdi-znav-scho-mayu-ukrayinske-prizvische-spivzasnovnik-apple-voznyak-vidvidav-kiyiv-1001620.html | title = Завжди знав, що маю українське прізвище: співзасновник Apple Возняк відвідав Київ | date = September 30, 2017 | format = video | work = TSN 19:30 | publisher = [[1+1 (TV channel)|1+1]] | location = [[Kiev]] | accessdate = December 12, 2017 | quote = This is a very special visit for us.

In the early 1970s, Wozniak's [[blue box]] design earned him the nickname "Berkeley Blue" in the [[phreaking]] community.&lt;ref name=slate.com/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lapsley |first=Phil |url= http://www.salon.com/2013/02/16/from_phreaks_to_apple_steve_jobs_and_steve_wozniaks_eureka_moment/ |title=From "phreaks" to Apple: Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak's "eureka!" moment |work=[[Salon.com]] |date=February 16, 2013 |accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wozniak has credited watching ''[[Star Trek]]'' and attending [[Trekkie|''Star Trek'' conventions]] while in his youth as a source of inspiration for his starting [[Apple Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/interview-steve-wozniak-on-sci-fi-comic-books-and_us_58f7e86de4b081380af51897 Huffingtonpost interview]. Retrieved on April 22, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Origins of Apple===
In 1969, Wozniak returned to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] after being expelled from the [[University of Colorado Boulder]] in his first year for hacking the university's computer system and sending prank messages on it.&lt;ref name=CUIndependent /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.colorado.edu/chancellor/2016/02/24/chancellor|title=From the Chancellor - Office of the Chancellor |publisher=[[University of Colorado Boulder]] |accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He re-enrolled at [[De Anza College]] in Cupertino before transferring to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1971.&lt;ref name="Apple Confidential"/&gt;{{rp|page=1}} In June 1971, as a self-taught project, Wozniak designed and built his first computer with his friend [[Bill Fernandez]].&lt;ref name="Apple Confidential"/&gt;{{rp|page=1}} Predating useful microprocessors, screens, and keyboards, and using a [[punch card]] and only 20 [[Transistor–transistor logic|TTL]] chips donated by an acquaintance, they named it "Cream Soda" after their [[cream soda|favorite beverage]]. A newspaper reporter stepped on the power supply cable and blew up the computer, but it served Wozniak as "a good prelude to my thinking 5 years later with the Apple I and Apple II computers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emberify.com/blog/cream-soda-the-first-computer/|title=Cream soda – The first computer|date=October 1, 2014|work=emberify.com|accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before focusing his attention on Apple, he was employed at [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP), where he designed calculators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMRmG72LBU8 |title=Steve Wozniak Talks About HP |website=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time that he dropped out of UC Berkeley and befriended [[Steve Jobs]].&lt;ref name=Jobs&amp;Woz/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCnews/&gt;

Wozniak was introduced to Jobs by Fernandez, who attended [[Homestead High School (Cupertino, California)|Homestead High School]] with Jobs in 1971. Jobs and Wozniak became friends when Jobs worked for the summer at HP, where Wozniak, too, was employed, working on a [[mainframe computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Jefferey S.|title=Steve Jobs: The Journey is the Reward.|date=December 1988|publisher=Lynx Books|isbn=155802378X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"We first met in 1971 during my college years, while he was in high school. A friend said, 'you should meet Steve Jobs because he likes electronics, and he also plays pranks.' So he introduced us."|source=Steve Wozniak&lt;ref name=ABCnews&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/PCWorld/story?id=3396207 |title=Three Minutes With Steve Wozniak |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=July 20, 2007 |accessdate=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[file:Blue Box in museum.jpg|thumb|Wozniak's [[blue box]] at the [[Computer History Museum]]]]
Their first business partnership began later that year when Wozniak read an article titled “Secrets of the Little Blue Box” from the October 1971 issue of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', and started to build his own “[[blue box]]es” that enabled one to make long-distance [[Phreaking|phone calls at no cost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |ref={{harvid|Isaacson|2011}} |first=Walter |last=Isaacson |year=2011 |title=Steve Jobs |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781451648546 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa }} pp. 27–29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a38878/steve-jobs-steve-wozniak-blue-box-phone-phreaking/ |title=How Blue Box Phone Phreaking Put Steve Jobs and Woz on the Road to Apple |publisher=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |accessdate=November 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs, who handled the sales of the blue boxes, managed to sell some two hundred of them for $150 each, and split the profit with Wozniak.{{sfn|Linzmayer|2004|pages=1–2}}{{sfn|O'Grady|2009|pages=1–2}} Jobs later told his biographer that if it hadn't been for Wozniak's blue boxes, "there wouldn't have been an Apple."{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=30}}

In 1973, Jobs was working for [[arcade game]] company [[Atari, Inc.]] in [[Los Gatos, California]].&lt;ref name="intoday1"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/india-visit-gave-a-vision-to-steve-jobs/1/154785.html |title=An exclusive interview with Daniel Kottke|magazine=India Today|date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=October 27, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073007/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/india-visit-gave-a-vision-to-steve-jobs/1/154785.html |archivedate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned to create a [[Printed circuit board|circuit board]] for the arcade video game ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]''. According to Atari co-founder [[Nolan Bushnell]], Atari offered $100 ({{Inflation|US|100|1973|fmt=eq}}) for each chip that was eliminated in the machine. Jobs had little knowledge of circuit board design and made a deal with Wozniak to split the fee evenly between them if Wozniak could minimize the number of chips. Wozniak reduced the number of chips by 50, by using [[Random-access memory|RAM]] for the brick representation. Too complex to be fully comprehended at the time, the fact that this prototype also had no scoring or coin mechanisms meant Woz's prototype could not be used. Jobs was paid the full bonus regardless. Jobs told Wozniak that Atari gave them only $700 and that Wozniak's share was thus $350 ({{Inflation|US|350|1973|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref name="breakout"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.woz.org/letters/general/91.html |title= Letters&amp;nbsp;– General Questions Answered |accessdate=June 20, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110612071502/http://www.woz.org/letters/general/91.html |archivedate=June 12, 2011 }}, Woz.org&lt;br /&gt; Kent, Stevn: "The Ultimate History of Video Games", pp. 71–73.

While dismayed, he said that if Jobs had told him about it and had said he needed the money, Wozniak would have given it to him.&lt;ref name=Isaacson /&gt;{{rp|pages=104–107}}

In 1975, Wozniak began designing and developing the computer that would eventually make him famous, the [[Apple I]]. On June 29 of that year, he tested his first working prototype, displaying a few letters and running sample programs. It was the first time in history that a [[character (computing)|character]] displayed on a TV screen was generated by a home computer.&lt;ref name="iWoz" /&gt; With the Apple I, Wozniak was largely working to impress other members of the [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]]-based [[Homebrew Computer Club]],&lt;ref name="becomingsj"/&gt;{{rp|pages=35–38}} a local group of electronics hobbyists interested in computing. The Club was one of several key centers which established the home hobbyist era, essentially creating the microcomputer industry over the next few decades. Unlike other custom Homebrew designs, the Apple had an easy-to-achieve video capability that drew a crowd when it was unveiled.&lt;ref name="FireValley" /&gt;

By March 1, 1976, Wozniak completed the basic design of the [[Apple I]] computer.&lt;ref name="Apple Confidential"/&gt;{{rp|pages=5–6}} He alone designed the hardware, circuit board designs, and operating system for the computer.&lt;ref name="FireValley"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fire in the Valley |first1=Paul |last1=Freiberger |authorlink1=Paul Freiberger |last2=Swaine |first2=Michael |authorlink2=Michael Swaine (technical author) |year=2000 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=0-07-135892-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/fireinvalleymaki00frei_0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wozniak originally offered the design to [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] while working there, but was denied by the company on five different occasions.&lt;ref name="AI"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://appleinsider.com/articles/10/12/06/apple_co_founder_offered_first_computer_design_to_hp_5_times |title=Apple co-founder offered first computer design to HP 5 times |publisher=[[AppleInsider]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs then advised Wozniak to start a business of their own to build and sell bare [[printed circuit board]]s of the Apple I.&lt;ref name="Apple Confidential"/&gt;{{rp|pages=4–6}}&lt;ref name="becomingsj"&gt;{{cite book |title=Becoming Steve Jobs: The Evolution of a Reckless Upstart into a Visionary Leader|first1=Brent |last1=Schlender |first2=Rick |last2=Tetzeli|date=2016 |publisher=Crown Business; Reprint edition|isbn=9780385347426}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=35–38}} Wozniak, at first skeptical, was later convinced by Jobs that even if they were not successful they could at least say to their grandchildren that they had had their own company. To raise the money they needed to build the first batch of the circuit boards, Wozniak sold his [[HP-65|HP scientific calculator]] while Jobs sold his [[Volkswagen Type 2|Volkswagen van]].&lt;ref name="Apple Confidential"/&gt;{{rp|pages=4–6}}&lt;ref name="becomingsj"/&gt;{{rp|pages=35–38}}

On April 1, 1976, Jobs and Wozniak formed [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer Company]] (now called Apple Inc.) along with administrative supervisor [[Ronald Wayne]], whose participation in the new venture was short-lived. The two decided on the name "Apple" shortly after Jobs returned from Oregon and told Wozniak about his time spent on an [[apple orchard]] there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brandingstrategyinsider.com/2011/11/how-did-apple-computer-get-its-brand-name.html#.WgCTJhNSyt8 |title=How Did Apple Computer Get Its Brand Name? |work= Branding Strategy Insider |date=November 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the company was formed, Jobs and Wozniak made one last trip to the Homebrew Computer Club to give a presentation of the fully assembled version of the Apple I.&lt;ref name="becomingsj"/&gt;{{rp|pages=39–40}} [[Paul Terrell]], who was starting a new computer shop in [[Mountain View, California]], called the Byte Shop,&lt;ref name="iWoz"&gt;{{cite book |last= Wozniak |first= Steve |last2= Smith |first2= Gina |author2link= Gina Smith (author) |year= 2006 |title= iWoz: Computer Geek to Cult Icon: How I Invented the Personal Computer, Co-Founded Apple, and Had Fun Doing It |publisher=[[W.

Together the duo assembled the first boards in Jobs's parents' [[Los Altos, California|Los Altos]] home; initially in his bedroom and later (when there was no space left) in the garage. Wozniak's apartment in San Jose was filled with monitors, electronic devices, and computer games that he had developed. The Apple I sold for $666.66. Wozniak later said he had no idea about the relation between the number and the [[Number of the Beast|mark of the beast]], and that he came up with the price because he liked "repeating digits".&lt;ref name=VintageNews&gt;{{cite news |first=Goran |last=Blazeski |title=Apple-1, Steve Wozniak's hand-built creation, was Apple's first official product, priced at $666.66 |url= https://www.thevintagenews.com/2017/11/25/apples-first-official-product-was-priced-at-666-66/ |website=The Vintage News |date=November 25, 2017 |accessdate=November 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sold their first 50 system boards to Terrell later that year.{{clarify|date=November 2019}} 

In November 1976, Jobs and Wozniak received substantial funding from a then-semi-retired [[Intel]] product marketing manager and engineer named [[Mike Markkula]].&lt;ref name="Markkula1997"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/01/business/an-unknown-co-founder-leaves-after-20-years-of-glory-and-turmoil.html |title=An 'Unknown' Co-Founder Leaves After 20 Years of Glory and Turmoil |last=Markoff |first=John |date=September 1, 1997 |work=The New York Times |access-date=October 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Apple Confidential"/&gt;{{rp|page=10}} At the request of Markkula, Wozniak resigned from his job at HP and became the vice president in charge of research and development at Apple. Wozniak's Apple I was similar to the [[Altair 8800]], the first commercially available microcomputer, except the Apple I had no provision for internal expansion cards. With expansion cards, the Altair could attach to a computer terminal and be programmed in [[BASIC]]. In contrast, the Apple I was a hobbyist machine. Wozniak's design included a $25 [[CPU]] ([[MOS Technology 6502|MOS 6502]]) on a single circuit board with 256 [[byte]]s of [[Read-only memory|ROM]], 4K or 8K bytes of [[Random-access memory|RAM]], and a 40-character by 24-row display controller. Apple's first computer lacked a case, power supply, keyboard, and display{{emdash}}all components that had to be provided by the user. Eventually about 200 Apple I computers were produced in total.&lt;ref name="wozniak198412"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-12/1984_12_BYTE_09-13_Communications#page/n461/mode/2up | title=The Apple Story / Part 1: Early History | work=BYTE | date=December 1984 | accessdate=November 16, 2019 |author1=Williams, Gregg |author2=Moore, Rob | pages=A67 | type=interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Micromodem II in Apple II.jpg|thumb|An [[Apple II]] computer with an external [[modem]]]]
After the success of the Apple I, Wozniak designed the [[Apple II]], the first personal computer with the ability to display color graphics, and BASIC programming language built in.&lt;ref name="iWoz" /&gt; Inspired by "the technique [[Atari]] used to simulate colors on its first [[arcade game]]s", Wozniak found a way of putting colors into the [[NTSC]] system by using a {{US$|1}} chip,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macstories.net/news/woz-putting-color-in-the-computer-was-one-of-the-biggest-things-apple-ever-did/|title=Woz: Putting Color In The Computer Was One Of The Biggest Things Apple Ever Did|work=macstories.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; while colors in the [[PAL]] system are achieved by "accident" when a dot occurs on a line, and he says that to this day he has no idea how it works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2012/11/26/steve-wozniak-his-career-challenges-steve-jobs-tech-trends-and-advice/ |title= Steve Wozniak: His Career Challenges, Steve Jobs, Tech Trends and Advice |first= Dan |last= Schawbel |work=[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the design stage, Jobs argued that the Apple II should have two [[expansion slot]]s, while Wozniak wanted eight.&lt;ref name="iWoz" /&gt; After a heated argument, during which Wozniak threatened that Jobs should "go get himself another computer", they decided to go with eight slots. Jobs and Wozniak introduced the Apple II at the April 1977 [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. Wozniak's first article about the Apple II was in ''[[Byte magazine|Byte]]'' magazine in May 1977.&lt;ref name="The Apple-II by Woz"&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine=[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]] | title=The Apple-II | first=Stephen | last=Wozniak | date=May 1977 | volume=2 | issue=5 | page=36 | url=https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1977-05/page/n35 | accessdate=July 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers in the world.

Wozniak also designed the [[Disk II]] [[floppy disk drive]], released in 1978 specifically for use with the [[Apple II series]] to replace the slower [[Cassette tape#Data recording|cassette tape]] storage.

In 1980, Apple went public to instant and significant financial profitability, making Jobs and Wozniak both millionaires. The Apple II's intended successor, the [[Apple III]], released the same year, was a commercial failure and was discontinued in 1984. According to Wozniak, the Apple III "had 100 percent hardware failures", and that the primary reason for these failures was that the system was designed by Apple's marketing department, unlike Apple's previous engineering-driven projects.&lt;ref name="byte198501"/&gt;

During the early design and development phase of the [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]], Wozniak had a heavy influence over the project. Later named the "Macintosh 128k", it would become the first mass-market personal computer featuring an integral [[graphical user interface]] and [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]. The Macintosh would also go on to introduce the [[desktop publishing]] industry with the addition of the Apple [[LaserWriter]], the first [[laser printer]] to feature [[vector graphics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/applehis/appl1984.htm |title=Chronology of Apple Computer Personal Computers |last=Polsson |first=Ken |date=July 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821105822/http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/applehis/appl1984.htm |archive-date=August 21, 2009 |access-date=October 29, 2019}} See May 3, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 interview, Wozniak said that in 1981, "Steve [Jobs] really took over the project when I had a plane crash and wasn't there."&lt;ref name=TheVerge/&gt;&lt;ref name=wozorg/&gt;

===Plane crash and temporary leave from Apple===
On February 7, 1981, the [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] A36TC which Wozniak was piloting crashed soon after takeoff from the [[Santa Cruz Sky Park|Sky Park Airport]] in [[Scotts Valley, California|Scotts Valley]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tirrell |first=Rick |title= The wisdom of resilience builders : how our best leaders create the world's most enduring enterprises |year=2009 |publisher= [[AuthorHouse]] |location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=978-1-4490-5323-9|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airplane stalled while climbing, then bounced down the runway, broke through two fences, and crashed into an embankment. Wozniak and his three passengers—then-fiancée [[Candice Clark]], her brother Jack Clark, and Jack's girlfriend, Janet Valleau—were injured. Wozniak sustained severe face and head injuries, including losing a tooth, and also suffered for the following five weeks from [[anterograde amnesia]], the inability to create new memories. He had no memory of the crash, and did not remember his name while in the hospital or the things he did for a time after he was released.&lt;ref name="byte198501"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1985-01/1985_01_BYTE_10-01_Through_the_Hourglass#page/n167/mode/2up | title=The Apple Story / Part 2: More History and the Apple III | work=[[BYTE]] | date=January 1985 | accessdate=October 26, 2013 |last=Williams |first=Gregg |last2=Moore |first2=Rob | page=166 | type=interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Grady|first=Jason D.|title=Apple Inc.|year=2009|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-313-36244-6|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later state that Apple II computer games were what helped him regain his memory.&lt;ref name="iWoz"/&gt; The [[National Transportation Safety Board]] investigation report cited premature liftoff and pilot inexperience as probable causes of the crash.&lt;ref name="Apple Confidential"&gt;{{cite book|last=Linzmayer|first=Owen W.|title=Apple Confidential 2.0 : The Definitive History of the World's Most Colorful Company|year=2004|publisher=No Starch Press|location=San Francisco, Calif.|isbn=1-59327-010-0|edition=Rev. 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=28–30}}

Wozniak did not immediately return to Apple after recovering from the airplane crash, seeing it as a good reason to leave.&lt;ref name="byte198501"/&gt; ''Infinite Loop'' characterized this time: "Coming out of the semi-coma had been like flipping a reset switch in Woz's brain. It was as if in his thirty-year old body he had regained the mind he'd had at eighteen before all the computer madness had begun. And when that happened, Woz found he had little interest in engineering or design. Rather, in an odd sort of way, he wanted to start over fresh."&lt;ref name="Infinite Loop"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Michael S. Malone|first=Michael S.|last=Malone|year=1999|titlelink=Infinite Loop (book)|title=Infinite Loop|isbn=978-0-385-48684-2|oclc=971131326|url=https://archive.org/details/infiniteloophoww00malo}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|322}}

===UC Berkeley and US Festivals===
[[File:Steve Wozniak, 1983.jpg|thumb|Wozniak in 1983]]
Later in 1981, after recovering from the plane crash, Wozniak enrolled back at UC Berkeley to complete his degree. Because his name was well known at this point, he enrolled under the name Rocky Raccoon Clark, which is the name listed on his diploma,&lt;ref name=wozorg/&gt;&lt;ref name="wozemployee"/&gt;&lt;ref name=theconversation/&gt; although he did not officially receive his degree in electrical engineering and computer science until 1987.&lt;ref name=Jobs&amp;Woz/&gt;&lt;ref name=wozorg/&gt;

In May 1982 and 1983, Wozniak, with help from professional concert promoter [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], founded the company Unuson, an abbreviation of "unite us in song",&lt;ref name="World According"&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date=September 1, 1998 | first=Gary | last=Wolf | title=The World According to Woz | url=https://www.wired.com/1998/09/woz/ | accessdate=July 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; which sponsored two [[US Festival]]s, with "US" pronounced like the pronoun, not as initials. Initially intended to celebrate evolving technologies, the festivals ended up as a technology exposition and a rock festival as a combination of music, computers, television, and people. After losing several million dollars on the 1982 festival, Wozniak stated that unless the 1983 event turned a profit, he would end his involvement with rock festivals and get back to designing computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |title=Us Festival: More Music, Money and Madness|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 9, 1983 |issue=397|pages=42–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Wozniak returned to Apple product development, desiring no more of a role than that of an engineer and a motivational factor for the Apple workforce.&lt;ref name="iWoz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Infinite Loop"/&gt;{{rp|323–324}}

===Return to Apple product development===
[[File:Steve Wozniak and Andy Hertzfeld 1985.jpg|thumb|Wozniak and [[Macintosh]] system software designer [[Andy Hertzfeld]] at an [[Apple User Group Connection]] meeting in 1985]]
In the mid-1980s he designed the [[Apple Desktop Bus]], a [[proprietary hardware|proprietary]] [[serial communications|bit-serial]] [[peripheral bus]] that became the basis of all [[Macintosh]] and [[NeXT]] computer models.&lt;ref name="Flatow" /&gt;{{Verify source|date=July 2019}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=One cable to rule them all: a look at Apple's retired connectors through the years|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/07/04/a-brief-history-of-apples-retired-connectors-and-ports-over-the-years|website=AppleInsider|language=en|access-date=2020-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the mid-1980s, as the Macintosh experienced slow but steady growth, Apple's corporate leadership, including Steve Jobs, increasingly disrespected its [[Flagship#Flagship as metaphor|flagship]] [[cash cow]] Apple II series{{emdash}}and Wozniak along with it. The Apple II division{{emdash}}other than Wozniak{{emdash}}was not invited to the Macintosh introduction event, and Wozniak was seen kicking the dirt in the parking lot.&lt;ref name="Steve Thumbs"&gt;{{cite book | title=My Close Encounters With Steve Jobs | chapter=Chapter 10: Steve Thumbs his Nose at the Apple II | first=David | last=Bunnell | via=Cult of Mac | chapter-url=https://www.cultofmac.com/40434/steve-thumbs-his-nose-at-the-apple-ii-recollections/ | accessdate=July 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Apple II products provided about 85% of Apple's sales in early 1985, the company's January 1985 annual meeting did not mention the Apple II division or its employees, a typical situation that frustrated Wozniak.&lt;ref name="rice19850415"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zC4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;ots=a_Fs_n1Np8&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Unrecognized Apple II Employees Exit | work=[[InfoWorld]] | date=April 15, 1985 | accessdate=February 4, 2015 | last=Rice|first= Valerie | page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final departure from Apple workforce===
Even with the success he had helped to create at Apple, Wozniak believed that the company was hindering him from being who he wanted to be, and that it was "the bane of his existence".&lt;ref name="Flatow" /&gt; He enjoyed engineering, not management, and said that he missed "the fun of the early days".&lt;ref name="wozemployee"/&gt; As other talented engineers joined the growing company, he no longer believed he was needed there, and by early 1985, Wozniak left Apple again, stating that the company had "been going in the wrong direction for the last five years". He then sold most of his stock.&lt;ref name="rice19850415"/&gt;

The Apple II platform financially carried the company well into the Macintosh era of the late 1980s;&lt;ref name="rice19850415"/&gt; it was made semi-portable with the [[Apple IIc]] of 1984, was extended, with some input from Wozniak, by the [[16-bit]] [[Apple IIGS]] of 1986, and was discontinued altogether in 1992.

===Post-Apple career===
After his career at Apple, Wozniak founded [[CL 9]] in 1985, which developed and brought the first programmable [[universal remote]] control to market in 1987, dubbed the "CORE".&lt;ref name="iWoz" /&gt;

Beyond engineering, Wozniak's second lifelong goal had always been to teach elementary school because of the important role teachers play in students' lives. Eventually, he did teach computer classes to children from the fifth through ninth grades, and teachers as well.&lt;ref name=theconversation&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://theconversation.com/interview-steve-wozniak-apple-co-founder-and-inventor-of-the-home-computer-64313|title=Interview: Steve Wozniak, Apple co-founder and inventor of the home computer|work=[[The Conversation]]|first=David |last=Glancer|date=August 26, 2016 |access-date=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flatow"&gt;Flatow, Ira.

In 2001, Wozniak founded [[Wheels of Zeus]] (WOZ)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2002/TECH/industry/01/24/wozniak.zeus.idg/ |title= Apple co-founder turns the Wheels of Zeus |date= January 24, 2002 |last= Costello |first= Sam |publisher=[[CNN]] |access-date= October 19, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to create wireless [[GPS]] technology to "help everyday people find everyday things much more easily". In 2002, he joined the board of directors of [[Ripcord Networks]], Inc., joining Apple alumni [[Ellen Hancock]], [[Gil Amelio]], Mike Connor, and Wheels of Zeus co-founder [[Alex Fielding]] in a new [[telecommunications]] venture. Later the same year he joined the board of directors of [[Danger (company)|Danger, Inc.]], the maker of the [[Danger Hiptop|Hip Top]].

In 2006, Wheels of Zeus was closed, and Wozniak founded [[Acquicor Technology]], a [[holding company]] for acquiring technology companies and developing them, with Apple alumni Hancock and Amelio. From 2009 through 2014 he was chief scientist at [[Fusion-io]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/05/technology/business-computing/05wozniak.html |title=Wozniak Accepts Post at a Storage Start-Up |first= Ashlee |last= Vance |work=[[The New York Times]] |date= February 4, 2009 |accessdate= September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 he became chief scientist at Primary Data, which was founded by some former Fusion-io executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The Band's Back Together: Woz Joins Startup Primary Data |date= November 19, 2014 |first= Chris |last= Preimesberger |work=[[eWeek]] |url= http://www.eweek.com/virtualization/the-bands-back-together-woz-joins-startup-primary-data.html |accessdate= September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Silicon Valley Comic Con]] (SVCC) is an annual [[pop culture]] and [[technology]] [[Convention (meeting)|convention]] at the [[San Jose McEnery Convention Center]] in [[San Jose, California]].

In October 2017, Wozniak founded [[Woz U]], an online educational technology service for independent students and employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/10/13/apple-steve-wozniak-launches-woz-u-tech-school.html|title=Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak launches 'Woz U' tech school |last=Stangel|first=Luke|date=October 13, 2017|website=Bizjournals|access-date=May 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2018, Woz U was licensed as a school with the [[Arizona]] state board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-education/2018/12/20/woz-u-complaint-over-quality-steve-wozniak-scottsdale-school-dismissed/2343067002/|title=Complaint over quality of Woz U, Steve Wozniak's Scottsdale school, dismissed|website=azcentral|language=en|access-date=May 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though permanently leaving Apple as an active employee in 1985, Wozniak chose to never remove himself from the official employee list, and continues to represent the company at events or in interviews.&lt;ref name="wozemployee"/&gt; Today he receives a stipend from Apple for this role, estimated in 2006 to be {{US$|120000}} per year.&lt;ref name="iWoz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/bestoftv/2011/08/25/exp.piers.wozniak.jobs.reaction.cnn | work=CNN | title=CNN.com Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wozemployee"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://woz.org/letters/never-left-apple/|title=I Never Left Apple|date=January 3, 2018|work=Woz.org|access-date=October 2, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also an Apple shareholder.&lt;ref name="wozstock"&gt;[http://www.fool.com/research/2000/features000302.htm Apple's ''Other'' Steve (Stock Research)] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061019134707/http://www.fool.com/research/2000/features000302.htm |date=October 19, 2006 }} March 2, 2000, [[The Motley Fool]].&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained a friendly acquaintance with Steve Jobs until Jobs's death in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krishnamoorthy|first=Anand|last2=Li|first2=Susan|title=Jobs's Death Was Like Lennon, JFK Getting Shot, Wozniak Says|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-10-06/steve-jobs-s-death-struck-like-john-lennon-jfk-getting-shot-wozniak-says|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2006, Wozniak stated that he and Jobs were not as close as they used to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peterson |first=Kim |url= http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002929498_wozqa14.html |title=Steve Wozniak Q &amp; A |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=April 16, 2006 |accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 interview, Wozniak said that the original [[Macintosh]] "failed" under Steve Jobs, and that it was not until Jobs left that it became a success. He called the [[Apple Lisa]] group the team that had kicked Jobs out, and that Jobs liked to call the Lisa group "idiots for making [the Lisa computer] too expensive". To compete with the Lisa, Jobs and his new team produced a cheaper computer, one that, according to Wozniak, was "weak", "lousy" and "still at a fairly high price". "He made it by cutting the RAM down, by forcing you to swap disks here and there", says Wozniak. He attributed the eventual success of the Macintosh to people like [[John Sculley]] "who worked to build a Macintosh market when the Apple II went away".&lt;ref name=TheVerge&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Wozniak on Newton, Tesla, and why the original Macintosh was a 'lousy' product|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/27/4468314/steve-wozniak-on-how-the-newton-changed-his-life|accessdate=June 28, 2013|work=[[The Verge]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312014832/http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/27/4468314/steve-wozniak-on-how-the-newton-changed-his-life|archivedate=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He applied for [[Australian citizenship]] in 2012, and has stated that he would like to live in [[Melbourne]], Australia in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hopewell|first=Luke|title=Steve Wozniak Is Becoming An Australian Citizen|url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2012/09/steve-wozniak-is-becoming-an-australian-citizen/|website=[[Gizmodo]]|accessdate=June 12, 2014|date=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wozniak has been referred to frequently by the nickname "Woz", or "The Woz"; he has also been called "The Wonderful Wizard of Woz" and "The Second Steve" (in regard to his early business partner and longtime friend, [[Steve Jobs]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2011-03-steve-the-woz-wozniak-2011-isaac-asimov-science-awar |title= Steve "The Woz" Wozniak: 2011 Isaac Asimoz Science Award |publisher=[[American Humanist Association]] |first= Sean |last= Mulligan |accessdate= May 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120913002604/http://www.americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2011-03-steve-the-woz-wozniak-2011-isaac-asimov-science-awar |archivedate= September 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "WoZ" (short for "[[Wheels of Zeus]]") is the name of a company Wozniak founded in 2002.

Wozniak describes his impetus for joining the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] in 1979 as being able to spend more time with his then-wife, Alice Robertson, who belonged to the [[Order of the Eastern Star]], associated with the Masons. Wozniak has said that he quickly rose to a third degree Freemason because, whatever he does, he tries to do well. He was initiated in 1979 at Charity Lodge No. 362 in [[Campbell, California]], now part of Mt. Moriah Lodge No. 292 in Los Gatos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/wozniak_s/wozniak_s.html |title= A Few Famous Masons |publisher=[[Grand Lodge of British Columbia and the Yukon]] |accessdate= March 25, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today he is no longer involved: "I did become a Freemason and know what it's about but it doesn't really fit my tech/geek personality. Still, I can be polite to others from other walks of life. After our divorce was filed I never attended again but I did contribute enough for a lifetime membership."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://apple.slashdot.org/story/12/10/01/1527257/ask-steve-wozniak-anything |title= Ask Steve Wozniak Anything |date= October 1, 2012 |website=[[Slashdot]] |access-date=October 25, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wozniak was married to [[slalom canoe]] gold-medalist [[Candice Clark]] from June 1981 to 1987. They have three children together, the youngest being born after their divorce was finalized.&lt;ref name=macobserver&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.macobserver.com/columns/thisweek/2004/20040613.shtml |title= This Week in Apple History – June 7–13: The Woz Marries, Switcher Campaign Starts, IE Ended |publisher= The Mac Observer |date= June 13, 2004 |accessdate= November 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=people.com&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://people.com/archive/wizard-of-woz-vol-41-no-6/|title=Wizard of Woz|magazine= People.com|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a high-profile relationship with actress [[Kathy Griffin]], who described him on ''[[Tom Green's House Tonight]]'' in 2008 as "the biggest techno-nerd in the Universe", Wozniak married Janet Hill, his current spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://fortune.com/2012/03/16/im-in-trouble-says-wozs-wife/ |title= 'I'm in trouble' says Woz's wife |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |accessdate= February 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his religious views, Wozniak has called himself an "atheist or agnostic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archive.woz.org/letters/general/72.html |title=Letters-General Questions Answered |last=Wozniak |first=Steve |date=2002 |website=Woz.org |accessdate=November 22, 2017 |location=Los Gatos, California |quote=I am also atheist or agnostic (I don't even know the difference).

He is a member of a [[Segway Polo]] team, the ''Silicon Valley Aftershocks''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Steve Wozniak played in this year’s Segway polo world championships|url=https://qz.com/462689/steve-wozniak-played-in-this-years-segway-polo-world-championships/|last=Dobush|first=Grace|website=Quartz|language=en|access-date=2020-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, he co-authored with [[Gina Smith (author)|Gina Smith]] his autobiography, ''[[iWoz: From Computer Geek to Cult Icon: How I Invented the Personal Computer, Co-Founded Apple, and Had Fun Doing It]]''. The book made ''[[The New York Times Best Seller list]]''.&lt;ref name=wozorg/&gt;

Wozniak's favorite video game is ''[[Tetris (Game Boy)|Tetris]]'' for [[Game Boy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-9832348-52.html "Woz and I agree: 'Tetris' for the Gameboy is the best game ever], by Daniel Terdiman, December 11, 2007, Geek Gestalt on CNET News.&lt;/ref&gt; and he had a high score for ''[[Sabotage (computer game)|Sabotage]]''.&lt;ref name="softline198109"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1981&amp;pub=6&amp;id=1 | title=High Scores | work=Softline | date=September 1981 | accessdate=July 13, 2014 | page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s he submitted so many high scores for Tetris to ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' that they would no longer print his scores, so he started sending them in under the reversed name "Evets Kainzow".&lt;ref name=woz.org&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.woz.org/letters/evets-kainzow | title=Evets Kainzow | first=Steve | last=Wozniak | work=Woz.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the release of Game Boy, Wozniak called ''[[Gran Trak 10]]'' his "favorite game ever" and said that he played the arcade while developing hardware for the first version of ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'' for Atari.&lt;ref name=Isaacson&gt;{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|author-link=Walter Isaacson|title=Steve Jobs |year=2011 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4516-4853-9 |title-link=Steve Jobs (book)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=103–104}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Woz Was Here - Steve Wozniak On His Gaming Past |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1460/woz_was_here__steve_wozniak_on_.php?print=1 |first=Benj |last=Edwards |date=May 4, 2007 |work=Gamasutra}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Steve Jobs referred to Wozniak as a ''Gran Trak 10'' "addict".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bigfishgames.com/blog/the-history-of-breakout/ |title=The History of Breakout |last=Murphy |first=Conor |publisher=Big Fish Games |date=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wozniak has expressed his personal disdain for money and accumulating large amounts of wealth. He told ''[[Fortune Magazine|Fortune]]'' magazine in 2017, "I didn’t want to be near money, because it could corrupt your values... I really didn’t want to be in that super ‘more than you could ever need’ category." He also said that he only invests in things "close to his heart". When Apple first went public in 1980, Wozniak offered $10 million of his own stock to early Apple employees, something Jobs refused to do.&lt;ref name=CNBC/&gt; 

Wozniak has the condition [[prosopagnosia]], or face-blindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34188602 |title= Steve Wozniak: Shocked and amazed by Steve Jobs movie |last= Kelion |first= Leo |date= September 9, 2015 |website=[[BBC]] |access-date= September 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on artificial superintelligence===
In March 2015, Wozniak stated that while he had originally dismissed the writings of [[Ray Kurzweil]] who stated [[machine intelligence]] will outpace human intelligence within several decades, Wozniak had come to change his mind: "I agree that the future is scary and very bad for people. If we build these devices to take care of everything for us, eventually they'll think faster than us and they'll get rid of the slow humans to run companies more efficiently." Wozniak stated that he had started to identify a contradictory sense of foreboding about artificial intelligence, while still supporting the advance of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Holley |first= Peter |title= Apple co-founder on artificial intelligence: 'The future is scary and very bad for people' |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/03/24/apple-co-founder-on-artificial-intelligence-the-future-is-scary-and-very-bad-for-people/ |accessdate= January 7, 2018 |work=[[Washington Post]] |date= March 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 2015, Wozniak changed his mind, stating that a superintelligence takeover would be good for humans: "They're going to be smarter than us and if they're smarter than us then they'll realise they need us... We want to be the family pet and be taken care of all the time... I got this idea a few years ago and so I started feeding my dog filet steak and chicken every night because 'do unto others'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Gibbs |first= Samuel |title= Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak says humans will be robots' pets |url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/25/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-says-humans-will-be-robots-pets |accessdate= January 7, 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date= June 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Dowd |first= Maureen |authorlink= Maureen Dowd |title= Elon Musk's Billion-Dollar Crusade to Stop the A.I.

In 2016, Wozniak changed his mind again, stating that he no longer worried about the possibility of superintelligence emerging because he is skeptical that computers will be able to compete with human "intuition": "A computer could figure out a logical endpoint decision, but that’s not the way intelligence works in humans". Wozniak added that if computers do become superintelligent, "they're going to be partners of humans over all other species just forever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak dismisses AI concerns raised by Stephen Hawking and Nick Bostrom |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/steve-wozniak-ai-2016-10 |accessdate= January 7, 2018 |work=[[Business Insider]] |date= October 9, 2016 |language= en }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Stockton |first= Nick |title= How Steve Wozniak Got Over His Fear of Robots Turning People Into Pets |url= https://www.wired.com/2017/04/steve-wozniak-silicon-valleys-nerdiest-legend/ |accessdate= January 7, 2018 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date= April 19, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Elon Musk says AI could doom human civilization.
