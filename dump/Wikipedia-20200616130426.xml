[[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]] loyal to the [[left-wing|left]]-leaning [[Second Spanish Republic]], in alliance with [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchists]], of the [[Anarcho-communism|communist]] and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalist]] variety, fought against a revolt by the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]], an alliance of [[falangism|Falangists]], [[Monarchism|monarchists]], [[conservatism|conservatives]] and [[Catholics]], led by a military group among whom General [[Francisco Franco]] soon achieved a preponderant role. Due to the international [[Interwar period#Great Depression|political climate]] at the time, the war had many facets and was variously viewed as [[class struggle]], a [[war of religion]], a struggle between [[dictatorship]] and [[Republicanism|republican democracy]], between [[revolution]] and [[counterrevolution]], and between [[fascism]] and [[communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Juliá |first = Santos |author-link = Santos Juliá |title = Un siglo de España.

The war began after a ''[[pronunciamiento]]'' (a declaration of military opposition) against the Republican government by a group of generals of the [[Spanish Republican Armed Forces]], with General [[Emilio Mola]] as the primary planner and leader and having General [[José Sanjurjo]] as a figurehead. The government at the time was a coalition of Republicans, supported in the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] by [[communist]] and [[socialist]] parties, under the leadership of [[centre-left]] President [[Manuel Azaña]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=43}}{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=84}} The Nationalist group was supported by a number of conservative groups, including [[CEDA]], monarchists, including both the opposing [[Alfonsism|Alfonsists]] and the religious conservative [[Carlism|Carlists]], and the [[Falange Española de las JONS]], a [[Fascism|fascist]] political party.{{sfn|Payne|1973|pp=200–203}} After the deaths of Sanjurjo, [[Emilio Mola]] and [[Manuel Goded Llopis]], Franco emerged as the remaining leader of the Nationalist side.

The coup was supported by military units in the [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco]], [[Pamplona]], [[Burgos]], [[Zaragoza]], [[Valladolid]], [[Cádiz]], [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]], and [[Seville]]. However, rebelling units in some important cities—such as [[Madrid]], [[Barcelona]], [[Valencia]], [[Bilbao]], and [[Málaga]]—did not gain control, and those cities remained under the control of the government. This left Spain militarily and politically divided. The Nationalists and the Republican government fought for control of the country. The Nationalist forces received munitions, soldiers, and air support from [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], while the Republican side received support from the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Mexico]]. Other countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]], the [[French Third Republic]], and the [[United States]], continued to recognise the Republican government, but followed an official policy of [[Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War|non-intervention]]. Despite this policy, tens of thousands of citizens from non-interventionist countries directly participated in the conflict. They fought mostly in the pro-Republican [[International Brigades]], which also included several thousand exiles from pro-Nationalist regimes.

The Nationalists advanced from their strongholds in the south and west, capturing most of Spain's northern coastline in 1937. They also besieged Madrid and the area to its south and west for much of the war. After much of [[Catalonia]] was captured in 1938 and 1939, and Madrid cut off from Barcelona, the Republican military position became hopeless. Following the fall without resistance of Barcelona in January 1939, the recognition of the Francoist regime by France and the United Kingdom in February 1939, and internal conflict between Republican factions in Madrid in March 1939, Franco entered the capital and declared victory on 1 April 1939. Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards fled to refugee camps in [[southern France]].&lt;ref name="historytoday.com"&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/refugees-and-spanish-civil-war |title = Refugees and the Spanish Civil War &amp;#124; History Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those associated with the losing Republicans who stayed were persecuted by the victorious Nationalists. Franco established a dictatorship in which all right-wing parties were fused into the structure of the Franco regime.{{sfn|Payne|1973|pp=200–203}}

The war became notable for the passion and political division it inspired and for the many atrocities that occurred, on both sides. Organised [[purge]]s occurred in territory captured by Franco's forces so they could consolidate their future regime.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=88}} Mass executions on a lesser scale also took place in areas controlled by the Republicans,{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=86–87}} with the participation of local authorities varying from location to location.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=260–271}}&lt;ref&gt;Julius Ruiz. ''El Terror Rojo'' (2011). pp.&amp;nbsp;200–211.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{Main|Background of the Spanish Civil War}}
The 19th century was a turbulent time for Spain. Those in favour of reforming Spain's government vied for political power with conservatives, who tried to prevent reforms. Some liberals, in a tradition that started with the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]], sought to limit the power of the [[monarchy of Spain]] and to establish a liberal state. The reforms of 1812 were overturned when [[King Ferdinand VII]] dissolved the Constitution and ended the [[Trienio Liberal]] government.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=7}} Twelve successful coups were carried out between 1814 and 1874.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=7}} Until the 1850s, the economy of Spain was primarily based on agriculture. There was little development of a bourgeois industrial or commercial class. The land-based oligarchy remained powerful; a small number of people held large estates called ''[[Latifundium|latifundia]]'' as well as all the important government positions.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=19}}

In 1868, popular uprisings led to the overthrow of [[Queen Isabella II]] of the [[House of Bourbon]]. Two distinct factors led to the uprisings: a series of urban riots and a liberal movement within the middle classes and the military (led by [[Joan Prim|General Joan Prim]]) concerned with the ultra-conservatism of the monarchy. In 1873, Isabella's replacement, King [[Amadeo I of Spain|Amadeo I]] of the [[House of Savoy]], abdicated due to increasing political pressure, and the short-lived [[First Spanish Republic]] was proclaimed.{{sfn|Thomas|1961|p=13}}{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=21}} After the [[Restoration (Spain)|restoration of the Bourbons]] in December 1874,{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=22}} [[Carlism|Carlists]] and [[Anarchism|Anarchists]] emerged in opposition to the monarchy.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=24}}{{sfn|Fraser|1979|p=22}} [[Alejandro Lerroux]], Spanish politician and leader of the [[Radical Republican Party]], helped bring [[republicanism]] to the fore in [[Catalonia]], where poverty was particularly acute.{{sfn|Preston|2006|pp=24–26}} Growing resentment of [[conscription]] and of the military culminated in the [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]] in [[Barcelona]] in 1909.{{sfn|Thomas|1961|p=15}}

[[File:Alfonso XIIIdeEspaña.jpg|thumb|upright|On 12 April 1931, the Republicans won the elections and the [[Spanish Second Republic]] was proclaimed two days later. King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] resigned and went into exile.]]
[[Spain during World War I|Spain was neutral in World War I]]. Following the war, wide swathes of Spanish society, including the armed forces, united in hopes of removing the corrupt central government, but were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Preston|2006|pp=32-33}} Popular perception of communism as a major threat significantly increased during this period.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=15}} In 1923, a military [[coup d'état|coup]] brought [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] to power; as a result, Spain transitioned to government by military dictatorship.{{sfn|Thomas|1961|p=16}} Support for the Rivera regime gradually faded, and he resigned in January 1930. He was replaced by General [[Dámaso Berenguer]], who was in turn himself replaced by [[Juan Bautista Aznar-Cabañas|Admiral Juan Bautista Aznar-Cabañas]]; both men continued a policy of rule by decree. There was little support for the monarchy in the major cities. Consequently, [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII]] gave in to popular pressure for the establishment of a republic in 1931 and called municipal elections for 12 April of that year. The socialist and liberal republicans won almost all the provincial capitals, and following the resignation of Aznar's government, King Alfonso XIII fled the country.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=20–22}} At this time, the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was formed. It remained in power until the culmination of the Spanish Civil War.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=20}}

The revolutionary committee headed by [[Niceto Alcalá-Zamora]] became the provisional government, with Alcalá-Zamora as [[President (government title)|president]] and [[head of state]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=23}} The republic had broad support from all segments of society.{{sfn|Preston|2006|pp=38–39}} In May, an incident where a taxi driver was attacked outside a monarchist club sparked anti-clerical violence throughout [[Madrid]] and south-west [[Spain]]. The government's slow response disillusioned the right and reinforced their view that the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] was determined to persecute the church. In June and July the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]], known as the CNT, called several [[Strike action|strikes]], which led to a violent incident between CNT members and the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] and a brutal crackdown by the Civil Guard and the [[Spanish Army|army]] against the CNT in [[Seville]]. This led many workers to believe the Spanish Second Republic was just as oppressive as the monarchy, and the CNT announced its intention of overthrowing it via [[revolution]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=26}} Elections in June 1931 returned a large majority of Republicans and [[Socialism|Socialists]].{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=22}} With the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the government tried to assist rural Spain by instituting an [[eight-hour day]] and redistributing [[land tenure]] to farm workers.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=42}}{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=22}} The rural workers lived in some of the worst poverty in Europe at the time and the government tried to increase their wages and improve working conditions. This estranged small and medium landholders who used hired labour. The Law of Municipal Boundaries forbade the hiring of workers from outside the locality of the owner's holdings. Since not all localities had enough labour for the tasks required, the law had unintended negative consequences, such as sometimes shutting out peasants and renters from the labour market when they needed extra income as pickers. Labour arbitration boards were set up to regulate salaries, contracts and working hours; they were more favourable to workers than employers and thus the latter became hostile to them. A decree in July 1931 increased overtime pay and several laws in late 1931 restricted whom landowners could hire. Other efforts included decrees limiting the use of machinery, efforts to create a monopoly on hiring, strikes and efforts by unions to limit women's employment to preserve a labour monopoly for their members. Class struggle intensified as landowners turned to counterrevolutionary organisations and local oligarchs. Strikes, workplace theft, arson, robbery and assaults on shops, strikebreakers, employers and machines became increasingly common. Ultimately, the reforms of the Republican-Socialist government alienated as many people as they pleased.{{sfn|Seidman|2011|pp=16-17}}

Republican [[Manuel Azaña]] became prime minister of a minority government in October 1931.{{sfn|Thomas|1961|p=47}}{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=61}} [[Fascism]] remained a reactive threat, helped by controversial reforms to the military.{{sfn|Preston|2006|pp=45–48}} In December, a new reformist, liberal, and democratic [[Spanish Constitution of 1931|constitution]] was declared. It included strong provisions enforcing a broad [[secularization|secularisation]] of the Catholic country, which included the abolishing of Catholic schools and charities, which many moderate committed Catholics opposed.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=53}} At this point once the constituent assembly had fullfilled its mandate of approving a new constitution, it should have arranged for regular parliamentary elections and adjourned. However fearing the increasing popular oppostion the Radical and Socialist majority postponed the regular elections, therefore prolonging their way in power for two more years. This way the republican government of [[Manuel Azaña]] initiated numerous reforms to what in their view would "modernize" the country. In 1932 the Jesuits who were in charge of the best schools throughout the country were banned and had all their property confiscated. The army was reduced. Landowners were expropriated. Home rule was granted to Catalonia, with a local parliament and a president of its own. {{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=91}} On June 1933 Pope Pius XI issued the encyclical [[Dilectissima Nobis]], "On Oppression of the Church of Spain", raising his voice against the persecution of the Catholic Church in Spain.{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=93}}

In November 1933, the parties of the right won the [[Spanish general election, 1933|general elections]].&lt;ref name="casanova90"&gt;Casanova (2010). p.&amp;nbsp;90.&lt;/ref&gt; increased right-wing resentment of the incumbent government caused by a controversial decree implementing land reform,{{sfn|Preston|2006|pp=54–55}} the [[Casas Viejas incident]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hansen|first=Edward C.|date=2 January 1984|title=The Anarchists of Casas Viejas (Book Review) |journal=Ethnohistory|volume=31|issue=3|pages=235–236|doi=10.2307/482644 |jstor=482644}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the formation of a right-wing alliance, [[Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Right-wing Groups]] (CEDA). Another factor was the recent enfranchisement of women, most of whom voted for centre-right parties.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=27}} The left Republicans attempted to have [[Niceto Alcalá Zamora]] cancel the electoral results but did not succeed. In face of CEDA's electoral victory, president [[Niceto Alcalá-Zamora|Alcalá-Zamora]] declined to invite its leader, Gil Robles, to form a government fearing CEDA's monarchist sympathies and proposed changes to the constitution. Instead he invited the [[Radical Republican Party]]'s [[Alejandro Lerroux]] to do so. Despite receiving the most votes, CEDA was denied cabinet positions for nearly a year.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=84–85}}{{sfn|Payne|2006|pp=41–47}}

Events in the period after November 1933, called the "black two years", seemed to make a civil war more likely.{{sfn|Preston|2006|pp=66–67}} Alejandro Lerroux of the Radical Republican Party (RRP) formed a government, reversing changes made by the previous administration{{sfn|Preston|2006|pp=67–68}} and granting amnesty to the collaborators of the unsuccessful uprising by General [[José Sanjurjo]] in August 1932.{{sfn|Preston|2006|pp=63–65}}{{sfn|Thomas|1961|p=62}} Some monarchists joined with the then fascist-nationalist [[Falange Española y de las JONS]] ("Falange") to help achieve their aims.{{sfn|Preston|2006|pp=69–70}} Open violence occurred in the streets of Spanish cities, and militancy continued to increase,{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=70}} reflecting a movement towards radical upheaval, rather than peaceful democratic means as solutions.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=83}} A small insurrection by anarchists occurred in December 1933 in response to CEDA's victory, in which around a 100 people died.&lt;ref&gt;Casanova, Julián. "Terror and Violence: The Dark Face of Spanish Anarchism." International Labor and Working-Class History, no. 67 (2005): 79–99. http://www.jstor.org/stable/27672986.&lt;/ref&gt;  After a year of intense pressure, CEDA, the party with more seats in the parliament, was finally successful in forcing the acceptance of three ministries. As a reaction, the Socialists (PSOE) and Communists triggered an insurrection that they had been preparing for nine months.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=88}} The rebellion  developed into a bloody [[Revolution of 1934|revolutionary uprising]], trying to overthrow the legitimate democratic regime. Fairly well armed revolutionaries managed to take the whole province of Asturias,  committing numerous murders of policemen, clerigman and civilians and destroying religious buildings including churches, convents and part of the university at Oviedo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Orella Martínez |first1=José Luis |last2=Mizerska-Wrotkowska |first2=Malgorzata |title=Poland and Spain in the interwar and postwar period |date=2015 |publisher=SCHEDAS, S.l |location=Madrid Spain |isbn=9788494418068 |ref=Harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the occupied areas the rebels officially declared the proletarian revolution and abolished regular money.{{sfn|Payne|1993|p=219}} The rebellion was crushed in two week by the [[Spanish Navy]] and the [[Spanish Republican Army]], the latter using mainly [[Regulares|Moorish colonial troops]] from [[Spanish Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;The Splintering of Spain, p.54 CUP, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Azaña was in Barcelona that day, and the Lerroux-CEDA government tried to implicate him. He was arrested and charged with complicity. In fact Azaña had no connection with the rebellion and was released from prison in January 1935.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=27–30}}

With this rebellion against established political legitimate authority, the Socialists showed identical repudiation of representative institutional system that anarchists had practiced.{{sfn|Casanova|2010|p=138}} The Spanish historian [[Salvador de Madariaga]], an Azaña's supporter, and an exhiled vocal opponent of Francisco Franco is the author of a sharp critical reflection against the participation of the left in the revolt: “The uprising of 1934 is unforgivable. The argument that Mr Gil Robles tried to destroy the Constitution to establish fascism was, at once, hypocritical and false. With the rebellion of 1934, the Spanish left lost even the shadow of moral authority to condemn the rebellion of 1936” &lt;ref&gt;Madariaga – Spain (1964) p.416 as cited in {{cite book |last1=Orella Martínez |first1=José Luis |last2=Mizerska-Wrotkowska |first2=Malgorzata |title=Poland and Spain in the interwar and postwar period |date=2015 |publisher=SCHEDAS, S.l |location=Madrid Spain |isbn=9788494418068 |ref=Harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Reversals of land reform resulted in the central and southern countryside in 1935 witnessing expulsions, firings and arbitrary changes to working conditions, with landowners' behaviour at times reaching "genuine cruelty", violence against farmworkers and socialists, which caused several deaths. One historian argued that the behaviour of the right in the southern countryside was one of the main causes of hatred during the Civil War and possibly even the Civil War itself.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Stanley G.

In 1935 the government led by the [[Radical Republican Party]] went through a series of crisis and the president [[Niceto Alcalá-Zamora]] that had always been hostile to the government decided to call for new elections, refusing once more to invite CEDA, the party with more seats in the parliament, to form a government . The [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] won the [[Spanish general election, 1936|1936 general election]] with a narrow victory, in a process that some scholars consider to have been rigged. The revolutionary left wing masses took the streets, released prisoners. In the thirty-six hours following the election, sixteen people were killed (mostly by police officers attempting to maintain order or intervene in violent clashes) and thirty-nine were seriously injured, while fifty churches and seventy conservative political centres were attacked or set ablaze.&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez Tardio, Manuel. "Mobilization and political violence following the Spanish general elections of 1936." REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS 177 (2017): 147–179.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manuel Azaña Díaz]] was called upon to form a government before the electoral process had come to an end and he would shortly replace Zamora as president taking advantage of a constitutional loophole. Convinced that the left was no longer willing to follow the rule of law and that its vision of Spain was under threat, the right abandoned the parliamentary option and began to conspire as to how to best overthrow the republic, rather than taking control of it.{{sfn|Preston|1983|p=}}

PSOE's left wing socialists started to take action. [[Julio Álvarez del Vayo]] talked about "Spain' being converted into a socialist Republic in association with the Soviet Union". [[Francisco Largo Caballero]] declared that "the organized proletariat will carry everything before it and destroy everything until we reach our goal".{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=100}} The country rapidly descended into anarchy. Even the staunch socialist [[Indalecio Prieto]] at a party rally in Cuenca, in May 1936, complained: "we have never seen so tragic a panorama or so great a collapse as in Spain at this moment. Abroad Spain is classified as insolvent. This is not the road to socialism or communism but to desperat anarchism without even the advantage of liberty".{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=100}} The disenchantment with Azaña's rulling was also voiced by [[Miguel de Unamuno]], a republican and one of Spain's most respected intelectuals, who in June 1936 told a reporter who published his statement in El Adelanto that President [[Manuel Azaña]] should commit suicide as a patriotic act”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1= Rabaté |first1=Jean-Claude|last2= Rabaté |first2=Colette | date=2009 |title=Miguel de Unamuno: Biografía |publisher=TAURUS |language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stanley Payne, by July 1936 the situation in Spain had deteriorated massively. Spanish commentators spoke of chaos and preparation for revolution, foreign diplomats made plans in case of revolution and an interest in fascism developed among the threatened. Payne states that by July 1936:
::"The frequent overt violations of the law, assaults on property, and political violence in Spain were without precedent for a modern European country not undergoing total revolution. These included massive, sometimes violent and destructive strike waves, large-scale illegal seizures of farmland in the south, a wave of arson and destruction of property, arbitrary closure of Catholic schools, seizure of churches and Catholic property in some areas, widespread censorship, thousands of arbitrary arrests, virtual impunity for criminal action by members of Popular Front parties, manipulation and politicisation of justice, arbitrary dissolution of rightist organisations, coercive elections in Cuenca and Granada that excluded all opposition, subversion of the security forces, and a substantial growth in political violence, resulting in more than three hundred deaths. Moreover, because local and provincial governments were forcibly taken over, decreed by the government in much of the country rather than secured via any elections, they tended to have a coercive cast akin to that of local governments taken over by Italian Fascists in northern Italy during the summer of 1922. Yet as of early July the centrist and rightist opposition in Spain remained divided and impotent."{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2014|p=117}}

Laia Balcells observes that polarisation in Spain just before the coup was so intense that physical confrontations between leftists and rightists were a routine occurrence in most localities; six days before the coup occurred, there was a riot between the two in the province of Teruel. Balcells notes that Spanish society was so divided along Left-Right lines that the monk Hilari Raguer stated that in his parish, instead of playing "cops and robbers", children would sometimes play "leftists and rightists."&lt;ref&gt;Balcells, Laia. Rivalry and revenge. Cambridge University Press, 2017. pp.58–59&lt;/ref&gt; Within the first month of the Popular Front's government, nearly a quarter of the provincial governors had been removed due to their failure to prevent or control strikes, illegal land occupation, political violence and arson. The Popular Front government was more likely to persecute rightists for violence than leftists who committed similar acts. Azaña was hesitant to use the army to shoot or stop rioters or protestors as many of them supported his coalition. On the other hand, he was reluctant to disarm the military as be believed he needed them to stop insurrections from the extreme left. Illegal land occupation became widespread – poor tenant farmers knew the government was disinclined to stop them. By April 1936, nearly 100,000 peasants had appropriated 400,000 hectares of land and perhaps as many as 1 million hectares by the start of the civil war; for comparison, the 1931–33 land reform had granted only 6000 peasants 45,000 hectares. As many strikes occurred between April and July as had occurred in the entirety of 1931. Workers increasingly demanded less work and more pay. "Social crimes" – refusing to pay for goods and rent – became increasingly common by workers, particularly in Madrid. In some cases this was done in the company of armed militants. Conservatives, the middle classes, businessmen and landowners became convinced that revolution had already begun.{{sfn|Seidman|2011|pp=15-17}}

Prime Minister [[Santiago Casares Quiroga]] ignored warnings of a military conspiracy involving several generals, who decided that the government had to be replaced to prevent the dissolution of Spain.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=93}} Both sides had become convinced that if the other side gained power, then they would discriminate against their members and attempt to suppress their political organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, James, and Juan Carmona.

Shortly after the Popular Front's election victory, various groups of officers, both active and retired, got together to begin discussing the prospect of a coup. It would be only be by the end of April that General Emilio Mola would emerge as the leader of a national conspiracy network.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz, Julius. The'red Terror'and the Spanish Civil War. Cambridge University Press, 2014, pp.36–37&lt;/ref&gt; The Republican government acted to remove suspect generals from influential posts. Franco was sacked as chief of staff and transferred to command of the [[Canary Islands]].{{sfn|Preston|2006|pp=94-95}} [[Manuel Goded Llopis]] was removed as [[inspector general]] and was made general of the [[Balearic Islands]]. [[Emilio Mola]] was moved from head of the [[Army of Africa (Spain)|Army of Africa]] to military commander of [[Pamplona]] in [[Navarre]].{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=94}} This, however, allowed Mola to direct the mainland uprising. General [[José Sanjurjo]] became the figurehead of the operation and helped reach an agreement with the Carlists.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=94}} Mola was chief planner and second in command.{{sfn|Preston|1983|pp=4-10}} [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]] was put in prison in mid-March in order to restrict the Falange.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=94}} However, government actions were not as thorough as they might have been, and warnings by the Director of Security and other figures were not acted upon.{{sfn|Preston|2006|pp=94-95}}

The revolt was remarkably devoid of any particular ideology.{{sfn|Hayes|1965|p=103}} The major goal was to put an end to anarchical disorder.{{sfn|Hayes|1965|p=103}} Mola's plan for the new regime was envisioned as a "republican dictatorship", modelled after [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar's]] Portugal and as a semi-pluralist authoritarian regime rather than a totalitarian fascist dictatorship. The initial government would be an all-military "Directory", which would create a "strong and disciplined state." General Sanjurjo would be the head of this new regime, due to being widely liked and respected within the military, though his position would be a largely symbolic due to his lack of political talent. The 1931 Constitution would be suspended, replaced by a new "constituent parliament" which would be chosen by a new politically purged electorate, who would vote on the issue of republic versus monarchy. Certain liberal elements would remain, such as separation of church and state as well as freedom of religion. Agrarian issues would be solved by regional commissioners on the basis of smallholdings but collective cultivation would be permitted in some circumstances. Legislation prior to February 1936 would be respected. Violence would be required to destroy opposition to the coup, though it seems Mola did not envision the mass atrocities and repression that would ultimately manifest during the civil war.{{sfn|Payne|2012|pp=67-68}}{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=113}} Of particular importance to Mola was ensuring the revolt was at its core an Army affair, one that would not be subject to special interests and that the coup would make the armed forces the basis for the new state.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Stanley G. The Franco Regime, 1936–1975. University of Wisconsin Pres, 2011, pp.89–90&lt;/ref&gt; However, the separation of church and state was forgotten once the conflict assumed the dimension of a war of religion, and military authorities increasingly deferred to the Church and to the expression of Catholic sentiment.{{sfn|Payne|2012|pp=115-125}} However, Mola's program was vague and only a rough sketch, and there were disagreements among coupists about their vision for Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Payne |first1=Stanley G. |title=The Franco regime, 1936-1975 |date=2011 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |isbn=9780299110741 |page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jensen |first1=Geoffrey |title=Franco : soldier, commander, dictator |date=2005 |publisher=Potomac Books |isbn=9781574886443 |page=68 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June, [[List of Prime Ministers of Spain|Prime Minister]] Casares Quiroga met General [[Juan Yagüe]], who falsely convinced Casares of his loyalty to the republic.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=95}} Mola began serious planning in the spring.{{sfn|Preston|1983|p=}} Franco was a key player because of his prestige as a former director of the military academy and as the man who suppressed the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934]].{{sfn|Preston|1983|p=}} He was respected in the Army of Africa, the Army's toughest troops.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=96}} He wrote a cryptic letter to Casares on 23 June, suggesting that the military was disloyal, but could be restrained if he were put in charge. Casares did nothing, failing to arrest or buy off Franco.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=96}} With the help of the [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Secret Intelligence Service]] agents [[Cecil Bebb]] and Major [[Hugh Pollard (Major)|Hugh Pollard]], the rebels chartered a [[de Havilland Dragon Rapide|Dragon Rapide]] aircraft (paid for with help from [[Juan March Ordinas|Juan March]], the wealthiest man in Spain at the time)&lt;ref&gt;Casanova, Julián. The Spanish republic and civil war. Cambridge University Press, 2010, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; to transport Franco from the Canary Islands to [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco|Spanish Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;Alpert, Michael ''BBC History Magazine'' April 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The plane flew to the Canaries on 11 July, and Franco arrived in Morocco on 19 July.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=98}} According to Stanley Payne, Franco was offered this position as Mola's planning for the coup had become increasingly complex and it did not look like it would be as swift as he hoped, instead likely turning into a miniature civil war that would last several weeks. Mola thus had concluded that the troops in Spain were insufficient for the task and that it would be necessary to use elite units from North Africa, something which Franco had always believed would be necessary.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=115-116}}

On 12 July 1936, Falangists in Madrid killed police officer [[José Castillo (police officer)|Lieutenant José Castillo]] of the [[Guardia de Asalto]] (Assault Guard). Castillo was a Socialist party member who, among other activities, was giving military training to the UGT youth. Castillo had led the Assault Guards that violently suppressed the riots after the funeral of ''Guardia Civil'' lieutenant Anastasio de los Reyes. (Los Reyes had been shot by anarchists during 14 April military parade commemorating the five years of the Republic.){{sfn|Preston|2006|p=98}}

Assault Guard Captain Fernando Condés was a close personal friend of Castillo. The next day,after getting the approval of the minister of interior to illegally arrest a list of members or the parlieament, he led his squad to arrest [[José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones]], founder of CEDA, as a reprisal for Castillo's murder. But he was not at home, so they went to the house of [[José Calvo Sotelo]], a leading Spanish [[monarchism|monarchist]] and a prominent parliamentary conservative.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=99}} Luis Cuenca, a member of the arresting group and a Socialist who was known as the bodyguard of [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] leader [[Indalecio Prieto]], [[summary execution|summarily executed]] Calvo Sotelo by shooting him in the back of the neck.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=99}} [[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]] concludes that Condés intended to arrest Sotelo, and that Cuenca acted on his own initiative, although he acknowledges other sources dispute this finding.{{sfn|Thomas|2001|pp=196-198}}

Massive reprisals followed.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=99}} The killing of Calvo Sotelo with police involvement aroused suspicions and strong reactions among the government's opponents on the right.{{sfn|Thomas|2001|pp=196-198}} Although the nationalist generals were already planning an uprising, the event was a catalyst and a public justification for a coup.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=99}} [[Stanley G. Payne|Stanley Payne]] claims that before these events, the idea of rebellion by army officers against the government had weakened; Mola had estimated that only 12% of officers reliably supported the coup and at one point considered fleeing the country for fear he was already compromised, and had to be convinced to remain by his co-conspirators.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=115}} However, the kidnapping and murder of Sotelo transformed the "limping conspiracy" into a revolt that could trigger a civil war.&lt;ref&gt;Esdaile, Charles J. The Spanish Civil War: A Military History. Routledge, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=}} The involvement of forces of public order and a lack of action against the attackers hurt public opinion of the government. No effective action was taken; Payne points to a possible veto by socialists within the government who shielded the killers who had been drawn from their ranks. The murder of a parliamentary leader by state police was unprecedented, and the belief that the state had ceased to be neutral and effective in its duties encouraged important sectors of the right to join the rebellion.{{sfn|Seidman|2011|p=17}} Within hours of learning of the murder and the reaction, [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] changed his mind on rebellion and dispatched a message to [[Emilio Mola|Mola]] to display his firm commitment.{{sfn|Payne|2012|p=}}

The Socialists and Communists, led by [[Indalecio Prieto]], demanded that arms be distributed to the people before the military took over. The prime minister was hesitant.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=99}}

The uprising's timing was fixed at 17 July, at 17:01, agreed to by the leader of the Carlists, [[Manuel Fal Conde]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1961). p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the timing was changed—the men in the [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco]] were to rise up at 05:00 on 18 July and those in Spain proper a day later so that control of Spanish Morocco could be achieved and forces sent back to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] to coincide with the risings there.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=55–56}} The rising was intended to be a swift coup d'état, but the government retained control of most of the country.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=102}}

Control over Spanish Morocco was all but certain.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=56}} The plan was discovered in Morocco on 17 July, which prompted the conspirators to enact it immediately. Little resistance was encountered. The rebels shot 189 people.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=56–57}} Goded and Franco immediately took control of the islands to which they were assigned.{{sfn|Preston|1983|p=}} On 18 July, Casares Quiroga refused an offer of help from the CNT and [[Unión General de Trabajadores]] (UGT), leading the groups to proclaim a general strike—in effect, mobilising. They opened weapons caches, some buried since the 1934 risings, and formed militias.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=56}} The paramilitary security forces often waited for the outcome of militia action before either joining or suppressing the rebellion. Quick action by either the rebels or anarchist militias was often enough to decide the fate of a town.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=58–59}} General [[Gonzalo Queipo de Llano]] secured Seville for the rebels, arresting a number of other officers.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=59}}

=== Outcome ===
The rebels failed to take any major cities with the critical exception of [[July 1936 military uprising in Seville|Seville]], which provided a landing point for Franco's African troops, and the primarily conservative and Catholic areas of [[Old Castile]] and [[León (historical region)|León]], which fell quickly.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=102}} They took [[Cádiz]] with help from the first troops from Africa.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=60–61}}

The government retained control of [[Málaga]], [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]], and [[Almería]]. In Madrid, the rebels were hemmed into the [[Siege of Cuartel de la Montaña|Cuartel de la Montaña siege]], which fell with considerable bloodshed. Republican leader Casares Quiroga was replaced by [[José Giral]], who ordered the distribution of weapons among the civilian population.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=62}} This facilitated the defeat of the army insurrection in the main industrial centres, including Madrid, [[July 1936 military uprising in Barcelona|Barcelona]], and [[Valencia]], but it allowed anarchists to take control of Barcelona along with large swathes of [[Aragón]] and Catalonia.{{sfn|Chomsky|1969|p=}} General Goded surrendered in Barcelona and was later condemned to death.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=69}} The Republican government ended up controlling almost all the east coast and central area around Madrid, as well as most of [[Asturias]], [[Cantabria]] and part of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] in the north.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=55–61}}

Hugh Thomas suggested that the civil war could have ended in the favour of either side almost immediately if certain decisions had been taken during the initial coup. Thomas argues that if the government had taken steps to arm the workers, they could probably have crushed the coup very quickly. Conversely, if the coup had risen everywhere in Spain on the 18th rather than be delayed, it could have triumphed by the 22nd.{{sfn|Thomas|2001|p=}} While the militias that rose to meet the rebels were often untrained and poorly armed (possessing only a small number of pistols, shotguns and dynamite), this was offset by the fact that the rebellion was not universal. In addition, the Falangists and Carlists were themselves often not particularly powerful fighters either. However, enough officers and soldiers had joined the coup to prevent it from being crushed swiftly.&lt;ref&gt;Esdaile, Charles J. The Spanish Civil War: A Military History. Routledge, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebels termed themselves ''Nacionales'', normally translated "Nationalists", although the former implies "true Spaniards" rather than a [[nationalism|nationalistic cause]].{{sfn|Preston|2006|pp=102-103}} The result of the coup was a nationalist area of control containing 11 million of Spain's population of 25 million.{{sfn|Westwell|2004|p=9}} The Nationalists had secured the support of around half of Spain's territorial army, some 60,000 men, joined by the Army of Africa, made up of 35,000 men,{{sfn|Howson|1998|p=28}} and just under half of Spain's militaristic police forces, the Assault Guards, the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guards]], and the [[Carabinier#Spanish Carabineros under the Monarchy and Republic|Carabineers]].{{sfn|Westwell|2004|p=10}} Republicans controlled under half of the rifles and about a third of both machine guns and artillery pieces.{{sfn|Howson|1998|p=20}}

The Spanish Republican Army had just 18 tanks of a sufficiently modern design, and the Nationalists took control of 10.{{sfn|Howson|1998|p=21}} Naval capacity was uneven, with the Republicans retaining a numerical advantage, but with the Navy's top commanders and two of the most modern ships, heavy cruisers ''[[Spanish cruiser Canarias|Canarias]]''—captured at the [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] shipyard—and ''[[Spanish cruiser Baleares|Baleares]]'', in Nationalist control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alpert|first1=Michael|title=La guerra civil española en el mar|date=2008|publisher=Crítica|location=Barcelona|isbn=978-84-8432-975-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Spanish Republican Navy]] suffered from the same problems as the army—many officers had defected or been killed after trying to do so.{{sfn|Howson|1998|p=21}} Two-thirds of air capability was retained by the government—however, the whole of the [[Spanish Republican Air Force|Republican Air Force]] was very outdated.{{sfn|Howson|1998|pp=21-22}}

== Combatants ==
[[File:Spanish Civil War conscription age limits.jpg|thumb|left|Republican and Nationalist conscription age limits]]
The war was cast by Republican sympathisers as a struggle between tyranny and freedom, and by Nationalist supporters as [[Communism|communist]] and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] red hordes versus Christian civilisation.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=}} Nationalists also claimed they were bringing security and direction to an ungoverned and lawless country.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=}} Spanish politics, especially on the left, was quite fragmented, since socialists and communists supported the republic. During the republic, anarchists had mixed opinions, but both major groups opposed the Nationalists during the Civil War. The Nationalists, in contrast, were united by their fervent opposition to the Republican government and presented a more unified front.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=42-42}}

The coup divided the armed forces fairly evenly. One historical estimate suggests that there were some 87,000 troops loyal to the government and some 77,000 joining the insurgency,&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Stanley G. (1970), ''The Spanish Revolution'', {{OCLC|54588}}, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; though some historians suggest that the Nationalist figure should be revised upwards and that it probably amounted to some 95,000.&lt;ref&gt;Payne (1970), p.&amp;nbsp;315.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first few months, both armies were joined in high numbers by volunteers, Nationalists by some 100,000 men and Republicans by some 120,000.&lt;ref&gt;James Matthews, ''Our Red Soldiers': The Nationalist Army's Management of its Left-Wing Conscripts in the Spanish Civil War 1936–9'', [in:] ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 45/2 (2010), p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; From August, both sides launched their own, similarly scaled conscription schemes, resulting in further massive growth of their armies. Finally, the final months of 1936 saw the arrival of foreign troops, International Brigades joining the Republicans and Italian CTV, German Legion Condor and Portuguese Viriatos joining the Nationalists. The result was that in April 1937 there were some 360,000 soldiers in the Republican ranks and some 290,000 in the Nationalist ones.&lt;ref&gt;Payne (1970), pp. 329–330&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Republican forces during the Battle of Irún.jpg|thumb|Republican forces during the [[battle of Irún]] in 1936]]

The armies kept growing. The principal source of manpower was conscription; both sides continued and expanded their schemes, the Nationalists drafting more aggressively, and there was little room left for volunteering. Foreigners contributed little to further growth; on the Nationalist side the Italians scaled down their engagement, while on the Republican side the influx of new ''interbrigadistas'' did not cover losses on the front. At the turn of 1937/1938, each army numbered about 700,000.&lt;ref&gt;Payne (2012), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 1938, the principal if not exclusive source of new men was a draft; at this stage it was the Republicans who conscripted more aggressively, and only 47% of their combatants were in age corresponding to the Nationalist conscription age limits.&lt;ref&gt;following the Battle of Ebro the Nationalists have established that only 47% of Republican POWs taken were in age corresponding to the Nationalist conscription age; 43% were older and 10% were younger, Payne, Stanley G., ''The Spanish civil War, the Soviet Union, and communism'', Yale University Press, 2008, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; Just prior to the Battle of Ebro, Republicans achieved their all-time high, slightly above 800,000; yet Nationalists numbered 880,000.&lt;ref&gt;Payne (2012), p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; The Battle of Ebro, fall of Catalonia and collapsing discipline caused a great shrinking of Republican troops. In late February 1939, their army was 400,000&lt;ref&gt;Payne (1970), p. 360&lt;/ref&gt; compared to more than double that number of Nationalists. In the moment of their final victory, Nationalists commanded over 900,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;Payne (1987), p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

The total number of Spaniards serving in the Republican forces was officially stated as 917,000; later scholarly work estimated the number as "well over 1 million men",&lt;ref name="Payne 1970, p. 343"&gt;Payne (1970), p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; though earlier studies claimed a Republican total of 1.75 million (including non-Spaniards).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ramón Salas Larrazábal|Salas Larrazábal, Ramón]] (1980), ''Datos exactos de la Guerra civil'', {{ISBN|978-8430026944}}, pp. 288–289, also Matthews 2010, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of Spaniards serving in the Nationalist units is estimated at "nearly 1 million men",&lt;ref name="Payne 1970, p. 343" /&gt; though earlier works claimed a total of 1.26 million Nationalists (including non-Spaniards).&lt;ref&gt;Larrazábal (1980), pp. 288–289; also Matthews 2010, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only two countries openly and fully supported the Republic: Mexico and the USSR. From them, especially the USSR, the Republic received diplomatic support, volunteers, weapons and vehicles. Other countries remained neutral, this neutrality faced serious opposition from sympathizers in the United States and United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent in other European countries and from [[Marxism|Marxists]] worldwide. This led to formation of the [[International Brigades]], thousands of foreigners of all nationalities who voluntarily went to Spain to aid the Republic in the fight; they meant a great deal to [[morale]] but militarily were not very significant.

[[File:Manuel Azaña, 1933.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Manuel Azaña]] was the intellectual leader of the Second Republic and headman of the Republican side during most of the Civil War.]]

The Republic's supporters within Spain ranged from centrists who supported a moderately-capitalist [[liberal democracy]] to [[Anarchism in Spain|revolutionary anarchists]] who opposed the Republic but sided with it against the coup forces. Their base was primarily secular and urban but also included landless peasants and was particularly strong in industrial regions like [[Asturias]], the Basque country, and [[Catalonia]]{{sfn|Preston
|2006|pp=30-33}}

This faction was called variously ''leales'' "Loyalists" by supporters, "Republicans", the "Popular Front", or "the government" by all parties; and/or ''los rojos'' "the Reds" by their opponents.{{sfn|Howson|1998|p=}} Republicans were supported by urban workers, agricultural labourers, and parts of the middle class.{{sfn|Cohen|2012|pp=164-165}}

[[File:Reemplazo republicano.jpg|thumb|Republican volunteers at [[Teruel]], 1936]]
The conservative, strongly Catholic Basque country, along with Catholic [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and the more left-leaning Catalonia, sought autonomy or independence from the central government of Madrid. The Republican government allowed for the possibility of self-government for the two regions,{{sfn|Thomas|1987|pp=86-90}} whose forces were gathered under the [[Spanish Republican Army|People's Republican Army]] (''Ejército Popular Republicano'', or EPR), which was reorganised into [[mixed brigade]]s after October 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Orden, circular, creando un Comisariado general de Guerra con la misión que se indica |trans-title=Order, circular, creating a general comisariat of war with the indicated mission | language = es | publisher = Gaceta de Madrid: diario oficial de la República| date= 16 October 1936 |&lt;!-- year = CCLXXV | --&gt;volume = IV | number = 290 | page = 355 |url= http://www.boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE/1936/290/B00355-00355.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few well-known people fought on the Republican side, such as English novelist [[George Orwell]] (who wrote ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938), an account of his experiences in the war){{sfn|Dawson|2013|p=85}} and Canadian thoracic surgeon [[Norman Bethune]], who developed a mobile blood-transfusion service for front-line operations.{{sfn|Alpert|2013|p=167}} [[Simone Weil]] added herself for a while to the anarchist columns of Buenaventura Durruti, though fellow fighters feared she might inadvertently shoot them because she was short-sighted, and tried to avoid taking her on missions. By the account of her biographer Simone Petrement, Weil was evacuated from the front after a matter of weeks because of an injury sustained in a cooking accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pétrement, Simone |title=Simone Weil: A Life|url=|year=1988|publisher=Schocken Books.|pages=271–278 |doi=|isbn=978-0-8052-0862-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The ''Nacionales'' or Nationalists, also called "insurgents", "rebels" or, by opponents, ''Franquistas'' or "fascists" —feared national fragmentation and opposed the separatist movements. They were chiefly defined by their [[anti-communism]], which galvanised diverse or opposed movements like [[falangism|Falangists]] and monarchists. Their leaders had a generally wealthier, more conservative, monarchist, landowning background.{{sfn|Howson|1998|pp=1-2}}

The Nationalist side included the [[Carlism|Carlists]] and [[Alfonsism|Alfonsists]], Spanish nationalists, the fascist Falange, and most conservatives and monarchist liberals. Virtually all Nationalist groups had strong Catholic convictions and supported the native Spanish clergy.{{sfn|Howson|1998|p=}} The Nationals included the majority of the Catholic clergy and practitioners (outside of the Basque region), important elements of the army, most large landowners, and many businessmen.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=}} The Nationalist base largely consisted of the middle classes, conservative peasant smallholders in the North and Catholics in general. Catholic support became particularly pronounced as a consequence of the burning of churches and killing of priests in most leftists zones during the first six months of the war. By mid-1937, the Catholic Church gave its official blessing to the Franco regime; religious fervor was a major source of emotional support for the Nationalists during the civil war.{{sfn|Payne|1973|p=}} Michael Seidmann reports that devout Catholics, such as seminary students, often volunteered to fight and would die in disproportionate numbers in the war. Catholic confession cleared the soldiers of moral doubt and increased fighting ability; Republican newspapers described Nationalist priests as ferocious in battle and [[Indalecio Prieto]] remarked that the enemy he feared most was "the [[requetés|requeté]] who has just received communion."{{sfn|Seidman|2011|p=168}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2006-1204-510, Spanien, Schlacht um Guadalajara.jpg|thumb|[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie|Italian troops]] manning a [[10 cm M. 14 Feldhaubitze|10 cm howitzer]] at [[Guadalajara, Castile-La Mancha|Guadalajara]], 1937]]

One of the [[right-wing politics|rightists']] principal motives was to confront the [[anti-clericalism]] of the Republican regime and to defend the [[Catholic Church]],{{sfn|Howson|1998|pp=1-2}} which had been targeted by opponents, including Republicans, who blamed the institution for the country's ills. The Church opposed many of the Republicans' reforms, which were fortified by the Spanish Constitution of 1931.{{sfn|Werstein|1969|p=44}} Articles 24 and 26 of the 1931 constitution had banned the [[Society of Jesus]]. This [[proscription]] deeply offended many within the conservative fold. The revolution in the Republican zone at the outset of the war, in which 7,000 clergy and thousands of lay people were killed, deepened Catholic support for the Nationalists.{{sfn|Payne|2008|p=13}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.qub.ac.uk/sites/QUEST/FileStore/Issue4PerspectiviesonPowerPapers/Filetoupload,71752,en.pdf |last = Rooney |first = Nicola |title = The role of the Catholic hierarchy in the rise to power of General Franco|publisher=Queen's University, Belfast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the war, during the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934]], religious buildings were burnt and at least 100 clergy, religious civilians, and pro-Catholic police were killed by revolutionaries.{{sfn|Payne|1973|p=}}{{sfn|Coverdale|2002|p=148}} Franco had brought in Spain's [[Army of Africa (Spain)|colonial Army of Africa]] ({{lang-es|Ejército de África}} or {{lang|es|Cuerpo de Ejército Marroquí}}) and reduced the miners to submission by heavy artillery attacks and bombing raids. The [[Spanish Legion]] committed atrocities and the army carried out summary executions of leftists. The repression in the aftermath was brutal and prisoners were tortured.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=79}}

The Moroccan ''[[regulares|Fuerzas Regulares Indígenas]]'' joined the rebellion and played a significant role in the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/01/15/us-morocco-spain-war-idUSTRE50E0NT20090115 Morocco tackles painful role in Spain's past]," ''Reuters'' 14 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Nationalists are often assumed to have drawn in the majority of military officers, this is a somewhat simplistic analysis. The Spanish army had its own internal divisions and long-standing rifts. Officers supporting the coup tended to be ''africanistas'' (men who fought in North Africa between 1909 and 1923) while those who stayed loyal tended to be ''peninsulares'' (men who stayed back in Spain during this period). This was because during Spain's North African campaigns, the traditional promotion by seniority was suspended in for promotion by merit through battlefield heroism. This tended to benefit younger officers starting their careers as they could, while older officers had familial commitments that made it harder for them to be deployed in North Africa. Officers in front line combat corps (primarily infantry and cavalry) benefited over those in technical corps (those in artillery, engineering etc) because they had more chances to demonstrate the requisite battlefield heroism and had also traditionally enjoyed promotion by seniority. The ''peninsulares'' resented seeing the ''africanistas'' rapidly leap frog through the ranks, while the ''africanistas'' themselves were seen as swaggering and arrogant, further fuelling resentment. Thus when the coup occurred, officers who joined the rebellion, particularly from Franco's rank downwards, were often ''africanistas'', while senior officers and those in non-front line positions tended to oppose it (though a small number of senior ''africanistas'' opposed the coup as well).&lt;ref&gt;Esdaile, Charles J. The Spanish Civil War: A Military History. Routledge, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that officers who stayed loyal to the Republic were more likely to have been promoted and to have been favoured by the Republican regime (such as those in the Aviation and Assault Guard units).&lt;ref&gt;La Parra-Pérez, Alvaro. "Fighting Against Democracy: Military Factions in the Second Spanish Republic and Civil War (1931–1939)." Job Market Paper, University of Maryland (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus while often thought of as a "rebellion of the generals", this is not correct. Of the eighteen division generals, only four rebelled (of the four division generals without postings, two rebelled and two remained loyal). Fourteen of the fifty-six brigade generals rebelled. The rebels tended to draw from less senior officers. Of the approximately 15,301 officers, just over half rebelled.&lt;ref&gt;Casanova, Julián. The Spanish republic and civil war. Cambridge University Press, 2010, p.157&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other factions ===
Catalan and Basque nationalists were divided. Left-wing [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan nationalists]] sided with the Republicans, while Conservative Catalan nationalists were far less vocal in supporting the government, due to anti-[[clericalism]] and [[confiscation]]s occurring in areas within its control. [[Basque nationalism|Basque nationalists]], heralded by the conservative [[Basque Nationalist Party]], were mildly supportive of the Republican government, although some in Navarre sided with the uprising for the same reasons influencing conservative Catalans. Notwithstanding religious matters, Basque nationalists, who were for the most part Catholic, generally sided with the Republicans, although the PNV, Basque nationalist party, was reported passing the plans of Bilbao defences to the Nationalists, in an attempt to reduce the duration and casualties of siege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=E.

== Foreign involvement ==
{{Main|Foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War|International relations (1919–1939)|Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War}}
The Spanish Civil War exposed political divisions across Europe. The right and the Catholics supported the Nationalists to stop the spread of [[Bolshevism]]. On the left, including labour unions, students and intellectuals, the war represented a necessary battle to stop the spread of fascism. Anti-war and pacifist sentiment was strong in many countries, leading to warnings that the Civil War could escalate into a second world war.&lt;ref&gt;Zara Steiner, The Triumph of the Dark: European International History 1933–1939 (Oxford History of Modern Europe) (2013), pp. 181–251.&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, the war was an indicator of the growing instability across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1 = Emanuel |last1 = Adler |first2 = Vincent |last2 = Pouliot |title=International Practices |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UTUX9n1hAZ4C&amp;pg=PA184 |year=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=184–185 |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511862373 |isbn = 978-1-139-50158-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish Civil War involved large numbers of non-Spanish citizens who participated in combat and advisory positions. Britain and France led a [[political alliance]] of 27 nations that promised [[non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War|non-intervention]], including an embargo on all arms to Spain. The United States unofficially went along. Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union signed on officially, but ignored the embargo. The attempted suppression of imported material was largely ineffective, and France was especially accused of allowing large shipments to Republican troops.&lt;ref&gt;Stone (1997). p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; The clandestine actions of the various European powers were, at the time, considered to be risking another world war, alarming antiwar elements across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,757619-1,00.html |title=Spain:Business &amp; Blood |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=19 April 1937 |accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[League of Nations]]' reaction to the war was influenced by a fear of communism,{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=194}} and was insufficient to contain the massive importation of arms and other war resources by the fighting factions. Although a Non-Intervention Committee was formed, its policies accomplished little and its directives were ineffective.{{sfn|Stoff|2004|p=194}}

[[File:Himmoscaralcaz1940.jpg|thumb|General [[José Moscardó Ituarte|Moscardó]] showing [[Heinrich Himmler]] the ruins of the Alcázar]]
German involvement began days after fighting broke out in July 1936. [[Adolf Hitler]] quickly sent in powerful air and armored units to assist the Nationalists. The war provided combat experience with the latest technology for the German military. However, the intervention also posed the risk of escalating into a world war for which Hitler was not ready. Therefore he limited his aid, and instead encouraged [[Benito Mussolini]] to send in large Italian units.&lt;ref&gt;Zara Steiner, ''The Triumph of the Dark: European International History 1933–1939'' (2013) pp. 181–251.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nazi Germany]]'s actions included the formation of the multitasking [[Condor Legion]], a unit composed of volunteers from the [[Luftwaffe]] and the German Army (''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'') from July 1936 to March 1939. The Condor Legion proved to be especially useful in the 1936 [[Siege of the Alcázar|Battle of the Toledo]]. Germany moved the Army of Africa to mainland Spain in the war's early stages.{{sfn|Westwell|2004|p=87}} German operations slowly expanded to include strike targets, most notably—and controversially—the [[bombing of Guernica]] which, on 26 April 1937, killed 200 to 300 civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6583639.stm |title=The legacy of Guernica |publisher= |work=BBC website |access-date=6 June 2011 |date=26 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany also used the war to test new weapons, such as the Luftwaffe [[Junkers Ju 87]] Stukas and [[Junkers Ju-52]] transport Trimotors (used also as Bombers), which showed themselves to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;Musciano, Walter.

Retrieved on 2 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

German involvement was further manifested through undertakings such as [[German involvement in the Spanish Civil War#Operation Ursula|Operation Ursula]], a [[U-boat]] undertaking; and contributions from the [[Kriegsmarine]]. The Legion spearheaded many Nationalist victories, particularly in aerial combat,{{sfn|Westwell|2004|p=87}} while Spain further provided a proving ground for German tank tactics. The training which German units provided to the Nationalist forces would prove valuable. By the War's end, perhaps 56,000 Nationalist soldiers, encompassing infantry, artillery, aerial and naval forces, had been trained by German detachments.{{sfn|Westwell|2004|p=87}}

Hitler policy for Spain was shrewd and pragmatic. His instruction were clear: "...''A hundred per cent Franco's victory was not desirable from a German Point of view; rather were we interested in a continuance of the war and in the keeping up of the tension in the Mediterranean.''" Hitler wanted to help Franco just enough to gain his gratitude and to prevent the side supported by the Soviet Union from winning, but not large enough to give the Caudillo a quick victory.{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=127}} 

A total of approximately 16,000 German citizens fought in the war, with approximately 300 killed,{{sfn|Thomas|1961|p=634}} though no more than 10,000 participated at any one time. German aid to the Nationalists amounted to approximately £43,000,000 ($215,000,000) in 1939 prices,{{sfn|Thomas|1961|p=634}}{{NoteTag|Westwell (2004) gives a figure of 500 million Reichmarks.}} 15.5% of which was used for salaries and expenses and 21.9% for direct delivery of supplies to Spain, while 62.6% was expended on the Condor Legion.{{sfn|Thomas|1961|p=634}} In total, Germany provided the Nationalists with 600 planes and 200 tanks.{{sfn|Thomas|2001|p=937}}

==== Portugal ====
{{See|Viriatos}}
The [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo regime]] of Portuguese Prime Minister [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] played an important role in supplying Franco's forces with ammunition and logistical help.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=116,133, 143, 148, 174, 427}}

Salazar supported [[Francisco Franco]] and the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] in their war against the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Second Republic forces]], as well as the anarchists and the communists. The Nationalists lacked access to seaports early on, so Salazar's Portugal helped them receive armaments shipments from abroad, including [[military logistics|ordnance]] when certain Nationalist forces virtually ran out of ammunition. Consequently, the Nationalists called Lisbon "the port of Castile".{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=97}} Later, Franco spoke of Salazar in glowing terms in an interview in the ''Le Figaro'' newspaper: "The most complete statesman, the one most worthy of respect, that I have known is Salazar. I regard him as an extraordinary personality for his intelligence, his political sense and his humility. His only defect is probably his modesty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lochery| first=Neill |year=2011 |title=Lisbon: War in the Shadows of the City of Light, 1939–1945|url=|location= |publisher= PublicAffairs; 1 edition |page=19 |isbn=978-1586488796 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 September 1936, a naval revolt took place in Lisbon. The crews of two naval Portuguese vessels, The [[NRP Afonso de Albuquerque]] and the Dão, mutinied. The sailors, who were affiliated with the Communist Party, confined their officers and attempted to sail the ships out of Lisbon to join the Spanish Republican forces fighting in Spain. Salazar ordered the ships to be destroyed by gunfire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wiarda |authorlink=Howard J.

In January 1938, Salazar appointed [[Pedro Teotónio Pereira]] as special liaison of the Portuguese government to Franco's government, where he achieved great prestige and influence.{{sfn|Hoare|1946|p=117}} In April 1938, Pereira officially become a full-rank Portuguese ambassador to Spain, and he remained in this post throughout World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kay|first=Hugh|title=Salazar and Modern Portugal|year=1970|publisher=Hawthorn Books|location=New York|page = 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just a few days before the end of the Spanish Civil War, on 17 March 1939, Portugal and Spain signed the [[Iberian Pact]], a non-aggression treaty that marked the beginning of a new phase in Iberian relations. Meetings between Franco and Salazar played a fundamental role in this new political arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Inácia Rezola, "The Franco–Salazar Meetings: Foreign policy and Iberian relations during the Dictatorships (1942–1963)" ''E-Journal of Portuguese History'' (2008) 6#2 pp. 1–11. [http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Portuguese_Brazilian_Studies/ejph/html/issue12/html/mrezola.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; The pact proved to be a decisive instrument in keeping the Iberian Peninsula out of Hitler's continental system.{{sfn|Hoare|1946|pp=124-125}}

Despite its discreet direct military involvement—restrained to a somewhat "semi-official" endorsement, by its authoritarian regime, of a "Viriatos Legion" volunteer force was organised, but disbanded, due to political unrest.&lt;ref name=Othen&gt;Othen, Christopher. ''Franco's International Brigades'' (Reportage Press 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Between 8,000&lt;ref name=Othen/&gt; and 12,000{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=}} would-be legionaries did still volunteer, only now as part of various Nationalist units instead of a unified force. Due to the widespread publicity given to the Viriatos Legion previously, these Portuguese volunteers were still called "[[Viriatos]]".{{sfn|Thomas|1961|p=116}}{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=198}} Portugal was instrumental in providing the Nationalists with organizational skills and reassurance from the Iberian neighbour to Franco and his allies that no interference would hinder the supply traffic directed to the Nationalist cause.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=116}}

==== Others ====
The Conservative government of the UK maintained a position of strong neutrality and was supported by elites and the media, while the left mobilized aid to the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;David Deacon, ''British News Media and the Spanish Civil War'' (2008) p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The government refused to allow arms shipments and sent warships to try to stop shipments. It was [[Foreign Enlistment Act 1870|theoretically a crime]] to volunteer to fight in Spain, but about 4,000 went anyway. Intellectuals strongly favoured the Republicans. Many visited Spain, hoping to find authentic anti-fascism. They had little impact on the government, and could not shake the strong public mood for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Twilight Years: The Paradox of Britain Between the Wars'' (2009) pp. 319–340.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] was split, with its Catholic element favouring the Nationalists. It officially endorsed the boycott and expelled a faction that demanded support for the Republican cause; but it finally voiced some support to Loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. P. Taylor, ''English History 1914–1945'' (1965) pp. 393–398.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanian volunteers were led by [[Ion Moța]], deputy-leader of the [[Iron Guard]] ("Legion of the Archangel Michael"), whose group of Seven Legionaries visited Spain in December 1936 to ally their movement with the Nationalists.{{sfn|Othen|2008|p=102}}

Despite the Irish government's prohibition against participating in the war, about 600 Irishmen, followers of the Irish political activist and co-founder of the recently created political party of [[Fine Gael]] (unofficially called "The Blue Shirts"), Eoin O'Duffy, known as the [[Irish Brigade (Spanish Civil War)|"Irish Brigade"]], went to Spain to fight alongside Franco.{{sfn|Thomas|1961|p=635}} The majority of the volunteers were Catholics, and according to O'Duffy had volunteered to help the Nationalists fight against communism.{{sfn|Casanova|2010|p=225}}{{sfn|Mittermaier|2010|p=195}}

=== Support for the Republicans ===
==== International Brigades ====
{{Main|International Brigades}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H28510, Spanien, Gefechtsstand des Etkar André Bataillons.jpg|thumb|The Etkar André battalion of the [[International Brigades]]]]

In July 26, just eight days after the revolt had started, an international communist conference was held at Prague to arrange plans to help the Republican Government. It decided to raise an international brigade of 5,000 men and a fund of 1 billion francs.{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=115}} At the same time communist parties throughout the world quickly launched a full scale propaganda campaign in support of the Popular Front. The [[Communist International]] immediately reinforced its activity sending to Spain its leader [[Georgi Dimitrov]], and [[Palmiro Togliatti]] the chief of the [[Italian Communist Party|Communist Party of Italy]].{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=117}}{{sfn|Richardson|1982|p=12}} From August onward aid started to be sent from Russia, over one ship per day arrived at Spain's Mediterranean ports carrying munitions, rifles, machine guns, hand grenades, artillery and trucks. With the cargo came Soviet agents, technicians, instructors and propagandists.{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=117}}

The [[Communist International]] immediately started to organize the [[International Brigades]] with great care to conceal or minimize the communist character of the enterprise and to make it appear as a campaign on behalf of progressive democracy.{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=117}} Attractive misleading names were deliberately chosen, such as "Garibaldi" in Italy or "Abraham Lincoln" in the United States.{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=117}}

Many non-Spaniards, often affiliated with radical communist or socialist entities, joined the [[International Brigades]], believing that the Spanish Republic was a front line in the war against fascism. The units represented the largest foreign contingent of those fighting for the Republicans. Roughly 40,000 foreign nationals fought with the Brigades, though no more than 18,000 were in the conflict at any given time. They claimed to represent 53 nations.{{sfn|Thomas|1961|p=637}}

Significant numbers of volunteers came from in the [[French Third Republic|France]] (10,000), Nazi Germany and [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] (5,000), and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] (3,350). More than 1000 each came from the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom,  [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary]] and Canada.{{sfn|Thomas|1961|p=637}} The [[Thälmann Battalion]], a group of Germans, and the [[Garibaldi Battalion]], a group of Italians, distinguished their units during the [[Siege of Madrid]]. Americans fought in units such as the [[XV International Brigade]] ("Abraham Lincoln Brigade"), while Canadians joined the [[Mackenzie–Papineau Battalion]].{{sfn|Thomas|1961|pp=638-639}}

[[File:Dabrowszczacy przysiegaja wiernosc sprawie Republiki.jpg|thumb|left|[[Polish volunteers in the Spanish Civil War|Polish volunteers]] in the International Brigades]]
More than 500 Romanians fought on the Republican side, including [[Romanian Communist Party]] members [[Petre Borilă]] and [[Valter Roman]].&lt;ref&gt;Deletant (1999). p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; About 145 men&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyireland.com/volumes/volume13/issue3/reviews/?id=113849|title=Review of O'Riordan's memoir|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Ireland]] formed the [[Connolly Column]], which was immortalized by Irish folk musician [[Christy Moore]] in the song "[[Viva la Quinta Brigada]]". Some Chinese joined the Brigades; the majority of them eventually returned to China, but some went to prison or to French refugee camps, and a handful remained in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Benton, Pieke (1998). p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Soviet Union ====
[[File:Soviet armor in the spanish civil war.png|thumb|Review of Soviet armored fighting vehicles used to equip the [[Republican People's Army]] during the Spanish Civil War]]
Although [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Joseph Stalin]] had signed the [[Non-Intervention Agreement]], the Soviet Union contravened the League of Nations embargo by providing material assistance to the Republican forces, becoming their only source of major weapons. Unlike Hitler and Mussolini, Stalin tried to do this covertly.{{sfn|Howson|1998|p=125}} Estimates of material provided by the USSR to the Republicans vary between 634 and 806 aircraft, 331 and 362 tanks and 1,034 to 1,895 artillery pieces.{{sfn|Payne|2004|p=156}} Stalin also created Section X of the Soviet Union military to head the weapons shipment operation, called [[Operation X (Spanish Civil War)|Operation X]]. Despite Stalin's interest in aiding the Republicans, the quality of arms was inconsistent.{{sfn|Payne|2004|pp=156-157}}{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=152-153}} Many rifles and field guns provided were old, obsolete or otherwise of limited use (some dated back to the 1860s) but the [[T-26]] and [[BT-5]] tanks were modern and effective in combat.{{sfn|Payne|2004|pp=156-157}} The Soviet Union supplied aircraft that were in current service with their own forces but the aircraft provided by Germany to the Nationalists proved superior by the end of the war.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=152}}

The movement of arms from Russia to Spain was extremely slow. Many shipments were lost or arrived only partially matching what had been authorised.{{sfn|Howson|1998|pp=126-129}} Stalin ordered shipbuilders to include false decks in the design of ships and while at sea, Soviet captains used [[False flag|deceptive flags and paint schemes]] to evade detection by the Nationalists.{{sfn|Howson|1998|p=134}}

The USSR sent 2,000–3,000 military advisers to Spain; while the Soviet commitment of troops was fewer than 500 men at a time, Soviet volunteers often operated Soviet-made tanks and aircraft, particularly at the beginning of the war.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=163}}{{sfn|Graham|2005|p=92}}{{sfn|Thomas|2003|p=944}}{{sfn|Thomas|1961|p=637}} The Spanish commander of every military unit on the Republican side was attended by a "Comissar Politico" of equal rank, who represented Moscow.{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=121}}

The Republic paid for Soviet arms with official [[Bank of Spain]] gold reserves, 176 tonnes of which was transferred through France and 510 directly to Russia,{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=153-154}} which was called [[Moscow gold]].

Also, the Soviet Union directed Communist parties around the world to organise and recruit the International Brigades.{{sfn|Richardson|1982|pp=31-40}}

Another significant Soviet involvement was the activity of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs ([[NKVD]]) inside the Republican rearguard. Communist figures including [[Vittorio Vidali]] ("Comandante Contreras"), [[Iosif Grigulevich]], [[Mikhail Koltsov]] and, most prominently, [[Aleksandr Mikhailovich Orlov]] led operations that included the murders of Catalan [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] Communist politician [[Andrés Nin Pérez|Andrés Nin]], the socialist journalist [[Mark Rein (journalist)|Mark Rein]], and the independent left-wing activist [[José Robles]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=246,273}} Another NKVD-led operation was the shooting down (in December 1936) of the French aircraft in which the delegate of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC), [[Paracuellos massacres#Henny's Attempted Murder|Georges Henny]], carried extensive documentation on the [[Paracuellos massacres]] to France.&lt;ref&gt;Vidal, Cesar. ''La guerra que gano Franco.'' Madrid, 2008. p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mexico ====
Unlike the United States and major Latin American governments, such as the [[ABC nations]] and [[Peru]], [[Mexico]] supported the Republicans.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=139-140}}{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=291}} Mexico refused to follow the French-British non-intervention proposals,{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=139-140}} and provided $2,000,000 in aid and material assistance, which included 20,000 rifles and 20 million cartridges.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=139-140}}

Mexico's most important contributions to the Spanish Republic was its diplomatic help, as well as the sanctuary the nation arranged for Republican refugees, including Spanish intellectuals and orphaned children from Republican families. Some 50,000 took refuge, primarily in [[Mexico City]] and [[Morelia]], accompanied by $300&amp;nbsp;million in various treasures still owned by the Left.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=412-413}}

==== France ====
Fearing it might spark a civil war inside France, the leftist "Popular Front" government in France did not send direct support to the Republicans. French Prime Minister [[Léon Blum]] was sympathetic to the republic,{{sfn|Alpert|1994|p=14}} fearing that the success of Nationalist forces in Spain would result in the creation of an ally state of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, an alliance that would nearly encircle France.{{sfn|Alpert|1994|p=14}} Right-wing politicians opposed any aid and attacked the Blum government.{{sfn|Alpert|1994|pp=14-15}} In July 1936, British officials convinced Blum not to send arms to the Republicans and, on 27 July, the French government declared that it would not send military aid, technology or forces to assist the Republican forces.{{sfn|Alpert|1994|pp=20-23}} However, Blum made clear that France reserved the right to provide aid should it wish to the Republic: "We could have delivered arms to the Spanish Government [Republicans], a legitimate government... We have not done so, in order not to give an excuse to those who would be tempted to send arms to the rebels [Nationalists]."{{sfn|Alpert|1994|p=41}}

On 1 August 1936, a pro-Republican rally of 20,000 people confronted Blum, demanding that he send aircraft to the Republicans, at the same time as right-wing politicians attacked Blum for supporting the Republic and being responsible for provoking Italian intervention on the side of Franco.{{sfn|Alpert|1994|p=41}} Germany informed the French ambassador in Berlin that Germany would hold France responsible if it supported "the manoeuvres of Moscow" by supporting the Republicans.{{sfn|Alpert|1994|p=43}} On 21 August 1936, France signed the Non-Intervention Agreement.{{sfn|Alpert|1994|p=43}} However, the Blum government provided aircraft to the Republicans covertly with [[Potez 540]] bomber aircraft (nicknamed the "Flying Coffin" by Spanish Republican pilots),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adar.es/index/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=89|title=Potez 540/542|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811034430/http://adar.es/index/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=89|archivedate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dewoitine]] aircraft, and [[Loire 46]] fighter aircraft being sent from 7 August 1936 to December of that year to Republican forces.{{sfn|Alpert|1994|pp=46-47}} France, through the favor of pro-communist air minister [[Pierre Cot]] also sent a group of trained fighter pilots and engineers to help the Republicans.{{snf|Hayes|1951|p=115}}{{sfn|Werstein|1969|p=139}} Also, until 8 September 1936, aircraft could freely pass from France into Spain if they were bought in other countries.{{sfn|Alpert|1994|p=47}}

French novelist [[André Malraux]] was a strong supporter of the Republican cause; he tried to organise a volunteer air force (Escadrile Espana) on the Republican side, but as a practical organiser and squadron leader he was somewhat idealistic and inefficient. The Regular Spanish Air force commander [[Andrés García La Calle]] was openly critical of Malraux's military efficiency but recognised his usefulness as a propagandist. His novel ''L'Espoir'' and the film version he produced and directed (''[[Espoir: Sierra de Teruel]]'') were a great help for the Republican cause in France.

Even after covert support by France to the Republicans ended in December 1936, the possibility of French intervention against the Nationalists remained a serious possibility throughout the war. German intelligence reported to Franco and the Nationalists that the French military was engaging in open discussions about intervention in the war through French military intervention in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands.{{sfn|Payne|2008|p=28}} In 1938, Franco feared an immediate French intervention against a potential Nationalist victory in Spain through French occupation of Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and Spanish Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;Lukeš, Goldstein (1999). p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United States of America ====
{{Main|Lincoln Battalion}}

Many Americans volunteered and arrived in Spain in 1937. Utilizing the name of Abraham Lincoln, the communist supporting men from the US formed the [[Lincoln Battalion]], organized in January 1937 as part of the [[XV International Brigade]]. The Lincoln Battalion initially fielded three companies, two infantry and one machine gun. Included were sections of Latin American and Irish volunteers, organized as the Centuria Guttieras and the [[Connolly Column]], respectively. After less than two months of training, the Lincolns went into action in February 1937. Many of the volunteers recalled that training as, "They give me a gun and they give me 100 bullets and they send me to fight."&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;Lyden, Jacki. "Spanish Civil War Volunteers Revisit Battlegrounds," National Public Radio, October 8, 2006, accessed March 29, 2015, https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6221378.&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Brigade was usually used as shock troops, and as a result they suffered high casualties. By the end of the war the Lincoln Battalion had lost 22.5% of its strength.{{sfn|Payne|1973|p=}}

In 1985 in an interview with [[E. W. Scripps Company|Scripps-Howard]] editors, President [[Ronald Reagan]] said that most Americans believed that their fellow Americans who fought with the Loyalist forces were on the wrong side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Remark by Reagan on Lincoln Brigade Prompts Ire in Spain |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/10/world/remark-by-reagan-on-lincoln-brigade-prompts-ire-in-spain.html |work=The New York Times |date=10 May 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large air and [[sealift]] of Nationalist troops in Spanish Morocco was organised to the southwest of Spain.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=71}} Coup leader Sanjurjo was killed in a plane crash on 20 July,{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=96}}{{sfn|Thomas|1961|p=162}} leaving an effective command split between Mola in the North and Franco in the South.{{sfn|Preston|1983|p=}} This period also saw the worst actions of the so-called "[[Red Terror (Spain)|Red]]" and "[[White Terror (Spain)|White Terrors]]" in Spain.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=81–94}} On 21 July, the fifth day of the rebellion, the Nationalists captured the central [[Spanish Navy|Spanish naval base]], located in [[Ferrol, Galicia]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=73–74}}

A rebel force under Colonel [[Alfonso Beorlegui Canet]], sent by General Mola and Colonel Esteban García, undertook the [[Campaign of Gipuzkoa]] from July to September. The capture of [[Gipuzkoa]] isolated the Republican provinces in the north. On 5 September, the Nationalists closed the French border to the Republicans in the [[battle of Irún]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=116-117}} On 15 September [[San Sebastián]], home to a divided Republican force of anarchists and Basque nationalists, was taken by Nationalist soldiers.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=116}}

The Republic proved ineffective militarily, relying on disorganised revolutionary militias. The Republican government under Giral resigned on 4 September, unable to cope with the situation, and was replaced by a mostly Socialist organisation under [[Francisco Largo Caballero]].&lt;ref name="beevor144"&gt;Beevor (2006). p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; The new leadership began to unify central command in the republican zone.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=146–147}} The civilian militas were often simply just civilians armed with whatever was available. Thus they fared poorly in combat, particularly against the professional Army of Africa armed with modern weapons, ultimately contributing to Franco's rapid advance.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Helen.

On the Nationalist side, Franco was chosen as chief military commander at a meeting of ranking generals at [[Salamanca]] on 21 September, now called by the title ''[[generalissimo|Generalísimo]]''.{{sfn|Preston|1983|pp=}}{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=143}} Franco won another victory on 27 September when his troops relieved the [[siege of the Alcázar]] in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]],{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=143}} which had been held by a Nationalist garrison under [[José Moscardó Ituarte|Colonel José Moscardó Ituarte]] since the beginning of the rebellion, resisting thousands of Republican troops, who completely surrounded the isolated building. Moroccans and elements of the Spanish Legion came to the rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Timmermans, Rodolphe. 1937. ''Heroes of the Alcazar''. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after relieving the siege, Franco proclaimed himself ''[[Caudillo]]'' ("chieftain", the Spanish equivalent of the Italian [[Duce]] and the German [[Führer]]—meaning: 'director') while forcibly unifying the various and diverse Falangist, Royalist and other elements within the Nationalist cause.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=144}} The diversion to Toledo gave Madrid time to prepare a defense, but was hailed as a major propaganda victory and personal success for Franco.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=121}} On 1 October 1936, General Franco was confirmed head of state and armies in Burgos. A similar dramatic success for the Nationalists occurred on 17 October, when troops coming from Galicia relieved the besieged town of [[Oviedo]], in Northern Spain.{{sfn|Casanova|2010|p=109}}{{sfn|Cleugh|1962|p=90}}

In October, the Francoist troops launched a major offensive toward Madrid,{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=150}} reaching it in early November and launching a major assault on the city on 8 November.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=177}} The Republican government was forced to shift from Madrid to Valencia, outside the combat zone, on 6 November.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=171}} However, the Nationalists' attack on the capital was repulsed in fierce fighting between 8 and 23 November. A contributory factor in the successful Republican defense was the effectiveness of the [[Fifth Regiment]]&lt;ref name="5º Regimiento"&gt;Comín Colomer, Eduardo (1973); El 5º Regimiento de Milicias Populares. Madrid.&lt;/ref&gt; and later the arrival of the International Brigades, though only an approximate 3,000 foreign volunteers participated in the battle.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=177–183}} Having failed to take the capital, Franco bombarded it from the air and, in the following two years, mounted several offensives to try to encircle Madrid, beginning the three-year [[Siege of Madrid]]. The [[Second Battle of the Corunna Road]], a Nationalist offensive to the northwest, pushed Republican forces back, but failed to isolate Madrid. The battle lasted into January.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=191–192}}

With his ranks swelled by Italian troops and Spanish colonial soldiers from Morocco, Franco made another attempt to capture Madrid in January and February 1937, but was again unsuccessful. The [[Battle of Málaga (1937)|Battle of Málaga]] started in mid-January, and this Nationalist offensive in Spain's southeast would turn into a disaster for the Republicans, who were poorly organised and armed. The city was taken by Franco on 8 February.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=200-201}} The consolidation of various militias into the Republican Army had started in December 1936.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=202}} The main Nationalist advance to cross the [[Jarama]] and cut the supply to Madrid by the Valencia road, termed the [[Battle of Jarama]], led to heavy casualties (6,000–20,000) on both sides. The operation's main objective was not met, though Nationalists gained a modest amount of territory.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=208–215}}

A similar Nationalist offensive, the [[Battle of Guadalajara]], was a more significant defeat for Franco and his armies. This was the only publicised Republican victory of the war. Franco used Italian troops and [[blitzkrieg]] tactics; while many strategists blamed Franco for the rightists' defeat, the Germans believed it was the former at fault for the Nationalists' 5,000 casualties and loss of valuable equipment.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=216–221}} The German strategists successfully argued that the Nationalists needed to concentrate on vulnerable areas first.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=222}}

The "War in the North" began in mid-March, with the [[Biscay Campaign]]. The Basques suffered most from the lack of a suitable air force.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=223–229}} On 26 April, the Condor Legion bombed the town of [[Guernica]], killing 200–300 and causing significant damage. The destruction had a significant effect on international opinion. The Basques retreated.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=231–233}}

April and May saw the [[May Days]], infighting among Republican groups in Catalonia. The dispute was between an ultimately victorious government—Communist forces and the anarchist CNT. The disturbance pleased Nationalist command, but little was done to exploit Republican divisions.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=263–273}} After the fall of Guernica, the Republican government began to fight back with increasing effectiveness. In July, it made a [[Segovia Offensive|move to recapture]] [[Segovia]], forcing Franco to delay his advance on the Bilbao front, but for only two weeks. A similar Republican attack, the [[Huesca Offensive]], failed similarly.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=277}}

Mola, Franco's second-in-command, was killed on 3 June, in an airplane accident.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=235}} In early July, despite the earlier loss at the [[Battle of Bilbao]], the government launched a strong counter-offensive to the west of Madrid, focusing on [[Brunete]]. The [[Battle of Brunete]], however, was a significant defeat for the Republic, which lost many of its most accomplished troops. The offensive led to an advance of {{convert|50|km2|mi2}}, and left 25,000 Republican casualties.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=277-284}}

A Republican offensive against [[Zaragoza]] was also a failure. Despite having land and aerial advantages, the [[Battle of Belchite (1937)|Battle of Belchite]], a place lacking any military interest, resulted in an advance of only {{convert|10|km}} and the loss of much equipment.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=296–299}} Franco invaded [[Aragon|Aragón]] and [[Battle of Santander|took the city of Santander]] in [[Cantabria]] in August.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=237}} With the surrender of the Republican army in the Basque territory came the [[Santoña Agreement]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=237–238}} [[Gijón]] finally fell in late October in the [[Asturias Offensive]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=302}} Franco had effectively won in the north.

The [[Battle of Teruel]] was an important confrontation. The city, which had formerly belonged to the Nationalists, was conquered by Republicans in January. The Francoist troops launched an offensive and recovered the city by 22 February, but Franco was forced to rely heavily on German and Italian air support.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=315-322}}

On 7 March, Nationalists launched the [[Aragon Offensive]], and by 14 April they had pushed through to the Mediterranean, cutting the Republican-held portion of Spain in two. The Republican government attempted to sue for peace in May,{{sfn|Thomas|2003|pp=820-821]]}} but Franco demanded unconditional surrender, and the war raged on. In July, the Nationalist army [[Levante Offensive|pressed southward]] from Teruel and south along the coast toward the capital of the Republic at Valencia, but was halted in heavy fighting along the [[XYZ Line]], a system of fortifications defending Valencia.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=346-347}}

The Republican government then launched an all-out campaign to reconnect their territory in the [[Battle of the Ebro]], from 24 July until 26 November, where Franco personally took command.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=349-359}} The campaign was unsuccessful, and was undermined by the [[Munich Agreement|Franco-British appeasement of Hitler in Munich]].

Franco's troops conquered Catalonia in a whirlwind campaign during the first two months of 1939. [[Tarragona]] fell on 15 January,{{sfn|

Only Madrid and a few other strongholds remained for the Republican forces. On 5 March 1939 the Republican army, led by the Colonel [[Segismundo Casado]] and the politician [[Julián Besteiro]], rose against the prime minister Juan Negrín and formed the [[National Defence Council (Spain)|National Defence Council]] ''(Consejo Nacional de Defensa'' or ''CND)'' to negotiate a peace deal.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=391-392}} Negrín fled to France on 6 March,{{sfn|Thomas|2003|pp=879–882}} but the Communist troops around Madrid rose against the junta, starting a brief civil war within the civil war.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=256}} Casado defeated them, and began peace negotiations with the Nationalists, but Franco refused to accept anything less than unconditional surrender.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=394-395}}

On 26 March, the Nationalists started a general offensive, on 28 March the Nationalists occupied Madrid and, by 31 March, they controlled all Spanish territory.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=396-397}} Franco [[Final offensive of the Spanish Civil War|proclaimed victory]] in a radio speech aired on 1 April, when the last of the Republican forces surrendered.{{sfn|Derby|2009|p=28}}

In his capacity as consul in Paris, Chilean poet and politician [[Pablo Neruda]] organised the immigration to [[Chile]] of 2,200 Republican exiles in France using the ship ''[[SS Winnipeg]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuestro.cl/notas/rescate/winnipeg1.htm ''Winnipeg, el poema que cruzó el Atlántico''] {{in lang|es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 17,000 refugees housed in Gurs, farmers and others who could not find relations in France were encouraged by the Third Republic, in agreement with the Francoist government, to return to Spain. The great majority did so and were turned over to the Francoist authorities in [[Irún]].&lt;ref name="documentary"&gt;[http://www.histoire-immigration.fr/index.php?lg=fr&amp;nav=20&amp;flash=0 Film documentary] on the website of the ''[[Cité nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration]]'' {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there, they were transferred to the [[Miranda de Ebro]] camp for "purification" according to the [[Law of Political Responsibilities]]. After the proclamation by Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]] of the [[Vichy regime]], the refugees became political prisoners, and the French police attempted to round up those who had been liberated from the camp. Along with other "undesirable" people, the Spaniards were sent to the [[Drancy internment camp]] before being deported to [[Nazi Germany]]. About 5,000 Spaniards died in the [[Mauthausen concentration camp]].&lt;ref name="documentary" /&gt;

After the official end of the war, [[guerrilla warfare]] was waged on an irregular basis by the [[Spanish Maquis]] well into the 1950s, gradually reduced by military defeats and scant support from the exhausted population. In 1944, a group of republican veterans, who also fought in the [[French resistance]] against the Nazis, invaded the [[Val d'Aran]] in northwest Catalonia, but were defeated after 10 days.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=421-422}}

== Financing ==
During the Civil War the Nationalist and Republican military expenditures combined totalled some $3,89bn, on average $1,44bn annually.{{NoteTag|the war lasted 986 days; dollars are quoted at their nominal value of the late 1930s}} The overall Nationalist expenditures are calculated at $2,04bn, while the Republican ones reached ca. $1,85bn.{{sfn|MARTÍN-ACEÑA|MARTÍNEZ RUIZ|PONS|2012|pp=144–165}} In comparison, in 1936–1938 the French military spendings totalled $0,87bn, the Italian ones reached $2,64bn, and the British ones stood at $4,13bn.&lt;ref&gt;Maier Charles S. (1987), ''In Search of Stability: Explorations in Historical Political Economy'', {{ISBN|9780521346986}}, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; As in the mid-1930s the Spanish GDP was much smaller than the Italian, French or British ones,&lt;ref&gt; in the mid-1930s the Spanish GDP was 23% of the British one, 37% of the French one and 48% of the Italian one, see e.g. Maddison Angus, ''Historical Statistics of the World Economy'', available [https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/ here] &lt;/ref&gt; and as in the Second Republic the annual defence and security budget was usually around $0,13bn (total annual governmental spendings were close to $0,65bn),{{NoteTag|in 1934 the Spanish military spendings as reported by the statistical office were 958m ptas; in 1935 they were 1,065m ptas, Huerta Barajas Justo Alberto (2016), ''Gobierno u administración militar en la II República Española'', {{ISBN|9788434023031}}, p. 805. The peseta to dolar exchange rate for 1935 varied from 7,32 in August to 7,38 in January, Martínez Méndez P. (1990), ''Nuevos datos sobre la evolución de la peseta entre 1900 y 1936'', {{ISBN|8477930724}}, p. 14}} wartime military expenditures put huge strain on the Spanish economy. Financing the war posed enormous challenge for both the Nationalists and the Republicans.

The two combatant parties followed similar financial strategies; in both cases money creation, rather than new taxes or issue of debt, was key to financing the war.{{sfn|MARTÍN-ACEÑA|MARTÍNEZ RUIZ|PONS|2012|pp=144–165}}

Both sides relied mostly on domestic resources; in case of the Nationalists they amounted to 63% of the overall spendings ($1,28bn) and in case of the Republicans they stood at 59% ($1,09bn). In the Nationalist zone money creation was responsible for some 69% of domestic resources, while in the Republican one the corresponding figure stood at 60%;{{sfn|MARTÍN-ACEÑA|MARTÍNEZ RUIZ|PONS|2012|pp=144–165}} it was accomplished mostly by means of advances, credits, loans and debit balances from respective central banks.{{sfn|MARTÍN-ACEÑA|MARTÍNEZ RUIZ|PONS|2012|pp=144–165}} However, while in the Nationalist zone the rising stock of money was only marginally above the production growth rate, in the Republican zone it by far exceeded dwindling production figures. The result was that while by the end of the war the Nationalist inflation was 41% compared to 1936, the Republican one was in triple digits. The second component of domestic resource was fiscal revenue. In the Nationalist zone it grew steadily and in the 2nd half of 1938 it was 214% of the figure from the 2nd half of 1936.&lt;ref&gt;in nominal terms, in terms of purchasing power the growth was smaller; nominal figures were 396m ptas in the 2nd half of 1936 and 847m ptas in the 2nd half of 1938, {{harvnb|MARTÍN-ACEÑA|MARTÍNEZ RUIZ|PONS|2012|pp=144–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the Republican zone fiscal revenues in 1937 dropped to some 25% of revenues recorded in the proportional area in 1935, but recovered slightly in 1938. Neither side re-engineered the pre-war tax system; differences resulted from dramatic problems with tax collection in the Republican zone and from the course of the war, as more and more population was governed by the Nationalists. A smaller percentage of domestic resources came from expropriations, donations or internal borrowing.{{sfn|MARTÍN-ACEÑA|MARTÍNEZ RUIZ|PONS|2012|pp=144–165}}

Foreign resources amounted to 37% in case of the Nationalists ($0,76bn) and 41% in case of the Republicans ($0,77bn).{{NoteTag|when assessing financial cost of waging the war, some scholars limit their analysis to foreign resources only and set expenditures of both sides at some $0,7bn each, compare e.g. Romero Salvado, Francisco J. (2013), ''Historical Dictionary of the Spanish Civil War'', {{ISBN|9780810857841}}, p. 20. Similarly, another author claims that "the republican authorities obtained 714 million dollars, and this was the financial cost of the civil war for the Republicans", while "the financial cost of the war on the Francoist side was very similar, between 694 and 716 million dollars", Casanova, Julian (2013), ''The Spanish Civil War'', {{ISBN|9781848856578}}, p. 91. The same author claims in the same work that "losing the war cost the Republic almost as much as Franco spent on winning it, some six hundred million dollars on each side" (p. 185) }} For the Nationalists it was mostly the Italian and German credit;{{NoteTag|exact figures differ; one source claims $0,45bn for Italy and $0,23bn for Germany, Romero Salvado 2013, p. 20; the rest was mostly private credit from British (e.g. Rio Tinto) or US (e.g. Texaco) companies}} in case of the Republicans it was sales of gold reserves, mostly to the USSR and in much smaller amount to France. None of the sides resolved to public borrowing and none floated debt on foreign exchange markets.{{sfn|MARTÍN-ACEÑA|MARTÍNEZ RUIZ|2012|pp=144–165}}

Authors of recent studies suggest that given Nationalist and Republican spendings were comparable, earlier theory pointing to Republican mismanagement of resources is no longer tenable.{{NoteTag|earlier studies suggested that the Republican military expenditures were 4 times larger than the Nationalist ones (40bn ptas v. 12bn ptas); the conclusion drawn was that the Republicans have grossly mismanaged their resources. Recent studies claim that the above figures are calculated in nominal terms, and that entirely different picture emerges when inflation and exchange rates are taken into account,{{sfn|MARTÍN-ACEÑA|MARTÍNEZ RUIZ|PONS|2012|pp=144–165}}}} Instead, they claim that the Republicans failed to translate their resources into military victory largely because of constraints of the international non-intervention agreement; they were forced to spend in excess of market prices and accept goods of lower quality. Initial turmoil in the Republican zone contributed to problems, while at later stages the course of the war meant that population, territory and resources kept shrinking.{{sfn|MARTÍN-ACEÑA|MARTÍNEZ RUIZ|PONS|2012|pp=144–165}}

The death toll of the Spanish Civil War is far from clear and remains—especially in part related to war and postwar repression—a very controversial issue. Many general historiographic works—notably in Spain—refrain from advancing any figures; massive historical series,&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. the monumental ''Historia de España Menéndez Pidal'', (2005), vol. XL, {{ISBN|8467013060}}&lt;/ref&gt; encyclopedias&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia de Historia de España'' (1991), vol. 5, {{ISBN|8420652415}}&lt;/ref&gt; or dictionaries&lt;ref&gt;''Diccionario Espasa Historia de España y América'' (2002), {{ISBN|8467003162}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide no numbers or at best propose vague general descriptions;{{NoteTag|"provocó un número de caidós en combate sin precedentes, casi tantos como los muertos y desaparecidos en la retaguardia", ''Diccionario de historia y política del siglo XX'' (2001), {{ISBN|843093703X}}, p. 316, "habia comportado centenares de miles de muertos", Marín, José María, Ysàs, Carme Molinero (2001), ''Historia política de España, 1939–2000'', vol. 2, {{ISBN|978-8470903199}}, p. 17}} more detailed general history accounts produced by expert Spanish scholars often remain silent on the issue.{{NoteTag|Tusell, Javier, Martín, José Luis, Shaw, Carlos (2001), ''Historia de España: La edad contemporánea'', vol. 2, {{ISBN|978-8430604357}}, Pérez, Joseph (1999), ''Historia de España'', {{ISBN|978-8474238655}}, Tusell, Javier (2007), ''Historia de España en el siglo XX'', vol. 2, {{ISBN|978-8430606306}}}} Foreign scholars, especially Anglo-Saxon historians, are more eager to offer some general estimates, though some have revised their projections, usually downward,{{NoteTag|e.g. Stanley G. Payne reduced his earlier estimate of 465,000 (at most 300,000 "violent deaths" with 165,000 deaths from malnutrition which "must be added", Payne (1987), p. 220) to 344,000 (also "violent deaths" and malnutrition victims, Payne (2012), p. 245); Hugh Thomas in ''The Spanish Civil War'' editions from the 1960s opted for 600,000 (285,000 KIA, 125,000 executed, 200,000 malnutrition), in editions from the 1970s he reduced the figure to 500,000 (200,000 KIA, 125,000 executed, 175,000 malnutrition), referred after Clodfeler (2017), p. 383 and with slight revisions kept reproducing the figure also in last editions published before his death, compare Thomas, Hugh (2003), ''La Guerra Civil Española'', vol. 2, {{ISBN|8497598229}}, p. 993; Gabriel Jackson went down from 580,000 (including 420,000 victims of war and post-war terror), see Jackson (1965) to a range of 405,000–330,000 (including 220,000 to 170,000 victims of war and post-war terror), Jackson (2005), p. 14}} and the figures vary from 1 million to 250,000. Apart from bias/ill will, incompetence or changing access to sources, the differences result chiefly from categorisation and methodology issues.

The totals advanced usually include or exclude various categories. Scholars who focus on killings or "violent deaths" most typically list (1) combat and combat-related deaths; figures in this rubric range from 100,000{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=412}}{{sfn|Muñoz|1965|p=412}} to 700,000;&lt;ref&gt;Dupuy, Dupuy (1977), p. 1032, Teed (1992), 439&lt;/ref&gt; (2) rearguard terror, both judicial and extrajudicial, recorded until the end of the Civil War: 103,000&lt;ref&gt;Martínez de Baños, Szafran (2011), p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; to 235,000;&lt;ref name="Jackson 1965, p. 412"&gt;Jackson (1965), p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; (3) civilian deaths from military action, typically air raids: 10,000&lt;ref name="Jackson 1965, p. 412"/&gt; to 15,000.&lt;ref&gt;Dupuy, Dupuy (1977), p. 1032&lt;/ref&gt; These categories combined point to totals from 235,000&lt;ref&gt;Moa (2015), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; to 715,000.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker (2016), p. 1563,&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors opt for a broader view and calculate "death toll" by adding also (4) above-the-norm deaths caused by malnutrition, hygiene shortcomings, cold, illness, etc. recorded until the end of the Civil War: 30,000&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz (2009), p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; to 630,000.&lt;ref&gt;''Guerre civile d'Espagne'', [in:] ''Encyclopedie Larousse'' online, available [http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/divers/guerre_civile_d_Espagne/118441 here]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not unusual to encounter war statistics which include (5) postwar terror related to Civil War, at times up to the year of 1961: 23,000&lt;ref name="Larrazabal 1977, pp. 428–429"&gt;Larrazabal (1977), pp. 428–429&lt;/ref&gt; to 200,000.&lt;ref name="Jackson 1965, p. 412"/&gt; Some authors also add (6) foreign combat and combat-related deaths: 3,000&lt;ref&gt;Sandler (2002), p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; to 25,000,&lt;ref name="Larrazabal 1977, pp. 428–429"/&gt; (7) Spaniards killed in World War II: 6,000,&lt;ref name="Larrazabal 1977, pp. 428–429"/&gt; (8) deaths related to postwar guerilla, typically the [[:es:Invasión del Valle de Arán|Valle de Arán invasion]]: 4,000,&lt;ref name="Larrazabal 1977, pp. 428–429"/&gt; (9) above-the-norm deaths caused by malnutrition, etc., recorded after the Civil War but related to it: 160,000&lt;ref name="Larrazabal 1977, pp. 428–429"/&gt; to 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;highest considered estimate, Payne (2012), p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographers take an entirely different approach; instead of adding up deaths from different categories, they try to gauge the difference between the total number of deaths recorded during the war and the total that would result from applying annual death averages from the 1926–1935 period; this difference is considered excess death resulting from the war. The figure they arrive at for the 1936–1939 period is 346,000; the figure for 1936–1942, including the years of postwar deaths resulting from terror and war sufferings, is 540,000.{{NoteTag|Ortega, Silvestre (2006), p. 76; slightly different figures, 344,000 and 558,000, in earlier study completed using the same method, see Diez Nicolas (1985), p. 48.}} Some scholars go even further and calculate the war's "population loss" or "demographic impact"; in this case they might include also (10) migration abroad: 160,000{{NoteTag|only those who did not return to Spain, Payne (1987), p. 220.}} to 730,000{{NoteTag|Ortega, Silvestre (2006), p. 80; the number of migrants usually quoted is 450,000, which refers only to these who crossed to France in the first months of 1939, López, Fernando Martínez (2010), ''París, ciudad de acogida: el exilio español durante los siglos XIX y XX'', {{ISBN|978-8492820122}}, p. 252.}} and (11) decrease in birth rate: 500,000{{NoteTag|"a deficit of approximately a half million births resulted", Payne (1987), p. 218.}} to 570,000.{{NoteTag|delta between actual birth totals for 1936–1942 and birth totals which would have resulted from extrapolating average annual birth totals from the 1926–1935 period, Ortega, Silvestre (2006), p. 67.}}

In 2008 a Spanish judge, [[Baltasar Garzón]], opened an investigation into the executions and disappearances of 114,266 people between 17 July 1936 and December 1951.

{{quote|Though there was much wanton killing in rebel Spain, the idea of the ''limpieza'', the "cleaning up", of the country from the evils which had overtaken it, was a disciplined policy of the new authorities and a part of their programme of regeneration. In republican Spain, most of the killing was the consequence of anarchy, the outcome of a national breakdown, and not the work of the state, although some political parties in some cities abetted the enormities, and some of those responsible ultimately rose to positions of authority.|Hugh Thomas{{sfn|Thomas|1961|p=268}}}}

{{Quote| quote = In general, this was not an irrepressible outpouring of hatred, by the man in the street for his "oppressors", as it has sometimes been painted, but a semi-organized activity carried out by sections of nearly all the leftist groups.

Nationalist atrocities, which authorities frequently ordered so as to eradicate any trace of "leftism" in Spain, were common. The notion of a ''limpieza'' (cleansing) formed an essential part of the rebel strategy, and the process began immediately after an area had been captured.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=98}} According to historian Paul Preston, the minimum number of those executed by the rebels is 130,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pragda.com/pdfs/Preston-1.pdf |first=Paul |last = Preston |date=19 January 2008 |title = Paul Preston lecture: The Crimes of Franco |access-date=16 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110207183858/http://pragda.com/pdfs/Preston-1.pdf |archive-date=7 February 2011 |author-link = Paul Preston}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is likely to have been far higher, with other historians placing the figure at 200,000 dead.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=94}} The violence was carried out in the rebel zone by the military, the Civil Guard and the Falange in the name of the regime.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=88-89}} Julius Ruiz reports that the Nationalists killed 100,000 people during the war and executed at least 28,000 immediately after. The first three months of the war were the bloodiest, with 50 to 70 percent of all executions carried out by Franco's regime, from 1936 to 1975, occurring during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Juliuz Ruiz, ''Franco's Peace'', in Quigley, Paul, and James Hawdon, eds. Reconciliation After Civil Wars: Global Perspectives. Routledge, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The first few months of killings lacked much in the way of centralisation, being largely in the hands of local commanders. Such was the extent of the killings of civilians that General Mola was taken aback by them, despite his own planning emphasising the need for violence; early in the conflict he had ordered a group of leftist militiamen to be immediately executed, only to change his mind and rescind the order.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=202}} 

Many such acts were committed by reactionary groups during the first weeks of the war.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=88-89}} This included the execution of schoolteachers,{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=89}} because the efforts of the Second Spanish Republic to promote [[Laïcité|laicism]] and displace the Church from schools by closing religious educational institutions were considered by the Nationalists as an attack on the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Extensive killings of civilians were carried out in the cities captured by the Nationalists,{{sfn|Beevor|2007|p=121}} along with the execution of unwanted individuals. These included [[non-combatant]]s such as [[Trade unionism|trade-unionists]], Popular Front politicians, suspected [[Suppression of Freemasonry|Freemasons]], Basque, Catalan, [[Andalusian nationalism|Andalusian]], and [[Galicianism (Galicia)|Galician]] Nationalists, Republican intellectuals, relatives of known Republicans, and those suspected of voting for the Popular Front.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=88-89}}{{sfn|Jackson|1967|p=377}}{{sfn|Thomas|2001|pp=253-255}}&lt;ref&gt;Santos et al. (1999). p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=120-123}} The Nationalists also frequently killed military officers who refused to support them in the early days of the coup.{{sfn|Graham|2005|pp=23-24}} Many killings in the first few months were often done by vigilantes and civilian death squads, with the Nationalist leadership often condoning their actions or even assisting them.{{sfn|Graham|2005|pp=30-31}}

[[File:Barcelona bombing (1938).jpg|thumb|left|Bombing in [[Barcelona]], 1938]]

Nationalist forces massacred civilians in Seville, where some 8,000 people were shot; 10,000 were killed in [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba]]; 6,000–12,000 were killed in [[Badajoz]]{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=91}} after more than one thousand of landowners and conservatives were killed by the revolutionaries. In Granada, where working-class neighborhoods were hit with artillery and right-wing squads were given free rein to kill government sympathizers,&lt;ref&gt;Balfour, Sebastian. "Spain from 1931 to the Present". ''Spain: a History.'' Ed. Raymond Carr. New York: Oxford University Press, 2000. 257. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; at least 2,000 people were murdered.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=89}} In February 1937, over 7,000 were killed after the capture of [[Málaga]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=93}} When Bilbao was conquered, thousands of people were sent to prison. There were fewer executions than usual, however, because of the effect Guernica left on Nationalists' reputations internationally.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=236-237}} The numbers killed as the columns of the Army of Africa devastated and pillaged their way between Seville and Madrid are particularly difficult to calculate.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=302}} Landowners who owned the large estates of Southern Spain rode alongside the Army of Africa to reclaim via force of arms the land given to the landless peasants by the Republican government. Rural workers were executed and it was joked that they had received their "land reform" in the form of a burial plot.{{sfn|Graham|2005|p=32}}

Nationalists also murdered Catholic clerics. In one particular incident, following the capture of [[Bilbao]], they took hundreds of people, including 16 priests who had served as chaplains for the Republican forces, to the countryside or graveyards and murdered them.&lt;ref&gt;Bieter, Bieter (2003). p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=82-83}}

Franco's forces also persecuted Protestants, including murdering 20 Protestant ministers.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=8}} Franco's forces were determined to remove the "Protestant heresy" from Spain.{{sfn|Seidman|2011|p=205}} The Nationalists also persecuted Basques, as they strove to eradicate Basque culture.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=237}} According to Basque sources, some 22,000 Basques were murdered by Nationalists immediately after the Civil War.{{sfn|Wieland|2002|p=47}}

The Nationalist side conducted [[aerial bombing of cities]] in Republican territory, carried out mainly by the Luftwaffe volunteers of the Condor Legion and the [[Regia Aeronautica|Italian air force]] volunteers of the Corpo Truppe Volontarie: Madrid, [[Bombing of Barcelona|Barcelona]], Valencia, [[Bombing of Guernica|Guernica]], [[Bombing of Durango|Durango]], and other cities were attacked. The Bombing of Guernica was the most controversial.{{sfn|Westwell|2004|p=31}} The Italian air force conducted a particularly heavy bombing raid on Barcelona in early 1938. While some Nationalist leaders did oppose the bombing of the city – for example, Generals Yagüe and Moscardó, who were noted for being nonconformists, protested against the indiscriminate destruction – other Nationalist leaders, often those of a fascist persuasion, approved of the bombings which they saw as necessary to "cleanse" Barcelona.{{sfn|Seidman|2002|p=156}}

Michael Seidman observes that the Nationalist terror was a key part of the Nationalist victory as it allowed them to secure their rear; the Russian Whites, in their respective civil war, had struggled to suppress peasant rebellions, bandits and warlordism behind their lines; British observers argued that if the Russian Whites had been able to secure law and order behind their lines, they would have won over the peasantry, while the inability of the Chinese Nationalists to stop banditry during the Chinese Civil War did severe damage to the regime's legitimacy. The Spanish Nationalists, in contrast, imposed a puritanically terrorist order on the populace in their territory. They never suffered from serious partisan activity behind their lines and the fact that banditry did not develop into a serious problem in Spain, despite how easy it would have been in such mountainous terrain, demands explanation. Seidman argues that severe terror, combined with control of the food supply, explains the general lack of guerilla warfare in the Nationalist rear.{{sfn|Seidman|2011|pp=30-31}}

Like clergy, civilians were executed in Republican territories. Some civilians were executed as suspected Falangists.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=84}} Others died in acts of revenge after Republicans heard of massacres carried out in the Nationalist zone.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=85}} Air raids committed against Republican cities were another driving factor.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=}} Shopkeepers and industrialists were shot if they did not sympathise with the Republicans, and were usually spared if they did.{{sfn|Beevor|3006|p=83}} Fake justice was sought through [[Kangaroo court|commissions]], named ''checas'' after the [[Cheka|Soviet secret police organization]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=84}}

According to 

, the Republican government only made efforts to stop the actions of the ''paseos'' late in the war; during the first few months, the government either tolerated it or made no efforts to stop it.{{sfn|Seidman|2017|p=}} The killings often contained a symbolic element, as those killed were seen as embodying an oppressive source of power and authority. This was also why the Republicans would kill priests or employers who were not considered to personally have done anything wrong but were nonetheless seen as representing the old oppressive order that needed to be destroyed.{{sfn|Graham|2005|p=27}}

As pressure mounted with the increasing success of the Nationalists, many civilians were executed by councils and tribunals controlled by competing Communist and anarchist groups.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=84}} Some members of the latter were executed by Soviet-advised communist functionaries in Catalonia,{{sfn|Thomas|1961|p=176}} as recounted by George Orwell's description of the purges in Barcelona in 1937 in ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'', which followed a period of increasing tension between competing elements of the Catalan political scene.

In the Andalusian town of [[Ronda]], 512 suspected Nationalists were executed in the first month of the war.{{sfn|Thomas|1961|p=176}} Communist [[Santiago Carrillo Solares]] was accused of the killing of Nationalists in the [[Paracuellos massacre]] near [[Paracuellos de Jarama]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=172-173}} Pro-Soviet Communists committed numerous atrocities against fellow Republicans, including other Marxists: [[André Marty]], known as the Butcher of [[Albacete]], was responsible for the deaths of some 500 members of the International Brigades.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=161}} Andrés Nin, leader of the POUM (Workers' Party of Marxist Unification), and many other prominent POUM members, were murdered by the Communists, with the help of the USSR's NKVD.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=272-273}}

The Republicans also conducted their own bombing attacks on cities, such as the [[bombing of Cabra]], and in fact conducted more indiscriminate air raids on cities and civilian targets than the Nationalists.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=194}}

Thirty-eight thousand people were killed in the Republican zone during the war, 17,000 of whom were killed in Madrid or Catalonia within a month of the coup. Whilst the Communists were forthright in their support of extrajudicial killings, much of the Republican side was appalled by the murders.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=87}} Azaña came close to resigning.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=85}} He, alongside other members of Parliament and a great number of other local officials, attempted to prevent Nationalist supporters being lynched.

In the anarchist-controlled areas, Aragon and Catalonia, in addition to the temporary military success, there was a vast [[social revolution]] in which the workers and peasants [[collectivisation|collectivised]] [[Land rights|land]] and [[industry]] and set up councils parallel to the paralyzed Republican government.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=102-122}} This revolution was opposed by the Soviet-supported communists who, perhaps surprisingly, campaigned against the loss of civil property rights.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=102-122}}

As the war progressed, the government and the communists were able to exploit their access to Soviet arms to restore government control over the war effort, through diplomacy and force.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=272-273}} Anarchists and the [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification]] (''Partido Obrero de Unificación Marxista'', POUM) were integrated into the regular army, albeit with resistance. The POUM Trotskyists were outlawed and denounced by the Soviet-aligned Communists as an instrument of the fascists.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=272-273}} In the ''[[Barcelona May Days|May Days]]'' of 1937, many thousands of anarchist and communist Republican soldiers fought for control of strategic points in Barcelona.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=263-273}}
[[File:Milicianas CNT-FAI.png|thumb|right|200px|Women from [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|FAI]] during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Social Revolution]].]]
The pre-war Falange was a small party of some 30,000–40,000 members.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=40}} It also called for a social revolution that would have seen Spanish society transformed by [[National Syndicalism]].{{sfn|Payne|1999|pp=151}} Following the execution of its leader, José Antonio Primo de Rivera, by the Republicans, the party swelled in size to several hundred thousand members.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=253}} The leadership of the Falange suffered 60 percent casualties in the early days of the civil war, and the party was transformed by new members and rising new leaders, called ''camisas nuevas'' ("new shirts"), who were less interested in the revolutionary aspects of National Syndicalism.&lt;ref&gt;Arnaud Imatz, "La vraie mort de Garcia Lorca" 2009 40 NRH, 31–34, pp.&amp;nbsp;32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Franco united all fighting groups into the Traditionalist Spanish Falange and the National Syndicalist Offensive Juntas ({{lang-es|Falange Española Tradicionalista de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista}}, FET y de las JONS).{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=255}}

The 1930s also saw Spain become a focus for [[pacifist]] organisations, including the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]], the [[War Resisters League]], and the [[War Resisters' International]]. Many people including, as they are now called, the ''insumisos'' ("defiant ones", [[conscientious objector]]s) argued and worked for non-violent strategies. Prominent Spanish pacifists, such as [[Amparo Poch y Gascón]] and [[José Brocca]], supported the Republicans. Brocca argued that Spanish pacifists had no alternative but to make a stand against fascism. He put this stand into practice by various means, including organizing agricultural workers to maintain food supplies, and through humanitarian work with war refugees.{{NoteTag|See variously: Bennett, Scott, ''Radical Pacifism: The War Resisters League and Gandhian Nonviolence in America, 1915–1963'', Syracuse NY, Syracuse University Press, 2003; Prasad, Devi, ''War Is a Crime Against Humanity: The Story of War Resisters' International'', London, WRI, 2005.

== Art and propaganda ==
[[File:Placegeorgeorwell.jpg|thumb|In Catalonia, a square near the Barcelona waterfront named ''Plaça George Orwell''.]]
Throughout the course of the Spanish Civil War, people all over the world were exposed to the goings-on and effects of it on its people not only through standard art, but also through [[propaganda]]. Motion pictures, posters, books, radio programs, and leaflets are a few examples of this media art that was so influential during the war. Produced by both nationalists and republicans, propaganda allowed Spaniards a way to spread awareness about their war all over the world. A film co-produced by famous early-twentieth century authors such as [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Lillian Hellman]] was used as a way to advertise Spain's need for military and monetary aid. This film, ''[[The Spanish Earth]]'', premiered in America in July 1937. In 1938, [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'', a personal account of his experiences and observations in the war, was published in the United Kingdom. In 1939, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] published in France a short story, [[The Wall (Sartre short story collection)|"The Wall"]] in which he describes the last night of prisoners of war sentenced to death by shooting.

Leading works of sculpture include [[Alberto Sánchez Pérez]]'s ''El pueblo español tiene un camino que conduce a una estrella'' ("The Spanish People Have a Path that Leads to a Star"), a 12.5&amp;nbsp;m monolith constructed out of plaster representing the struggle for a socialist utopia;&lt;ref name="museonacional"&gt;[http://www.museoreinasofia.es/en/collection/artwork/pueblo-espanol-tiene-camino-que-conduce-estrella-maqueta-there-way-spanish-people Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia], El pueblo español tiene un camino que conduce a una estrella (maqueta) (There Is a Way for the Spanish People That Leads to a Star [Maquette]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julio González (sculptor)|Julio González's]] ''La Montserrat'', an anti-war work which shares its title with a mountain near Barcelona, is created from a sheet of iron which has been hammered and welded to create a peasant mother carrying a small child in one arm and a sickle in the other. and [[Alexander Calder]]'s ''Fuente de mercurio'' (Mercury Fountain) a protest work by the American against the Nationalist forced control of Almadén and the mercury mines there.&lt;ref name="montserrat"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=2231 Museum of Modern Art].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pablo Picasso]] painted [[Guernica (painting)|''Guernica'']] in 1937, taking inspiration from the bombing of Guernica, and in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Battle of Anghiari]]''. ''Guernica'', like many important Republican masterpieces, was featured at the 1937 International Exhibition in Paris. The work's size (11&amp;nbsp;ft by 25.6&amp;nbsp;ft) grabbed much attention and cast the horrors of the mounting Spanish civil unrest into a global spotlight.&lt;ref name="picasso"&gt;[http://www.pablopicasso.org/guernica.jsp Pablo Picasso].&lt;/ref&gt; The painting has since been heralded as an anti-war work and a symbol of peace in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.oneonta.edu/faculty/farberas/arth/arth200/guernica.html SUNY Oneota], Picasso's Guernica.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joan Miró]] created ''El Segador'' (The Reaper), formally titled ''El campesino catalán en rebeldía'' (Catalan peasant in revolt), which spans some 18 feet by 12 feet&lt;ref name="joan"&gt;[http://www.phs.poteau.k12.ok.us/williame/APAH/readings/Joan%20Miro,%20Smithsonian,%20Nov93.pdf Stanley Meisler], For Joan Miró, Painting and Poetry Were the Same.&lt;/ref&gt; and depicted a peasant brandishing a sickle in the air, to which Miró commented that "The sickle is not a communist symbol. It is the reaper's symbol, the tool of his work, and, when his freedom is threatened, his weapon."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/blogs/reaper-miros-civil-war-protest TATE], 'The Reaper': Miró's Civil War protest.&lt;/ref&gt; This work, also featured at the 1937 International Exhibition in Paris, was shipped back to the Spanish Republic's capital in Valencia following the Exhibition, but has since gone missing or has been destroyed.&lt;ref name="joan" /&gt;

The Army of Africa would feature a place in propaganda on both sides, due to the complex history of the Army and Spanish colonialism in North Africa. Both sides would invent different characters of the Moorish troops, drawing on a wide range of historical symbols, cultural prejudices and racial stereotypes. The Army of Africa would be used as part of a propaganda campaign by both sides to portray the other side as foreign invaders attacking from outside the national community, while portraying their own as representing "true Spain."&lt;ref&gt;Bolorinos Allard, Elisabeth.

== Consequences ==
[[File:Nafarroako irakasleak 1936 1.jpg|thumb|190px|Tribute and plaque in memory of murdered or persecuted teachers, [[Navarre]], 1936 and later]]
=== Economic effects ===
Payment for the war on both sides was very high. Monetary resources on the Republican side were completely drained from weapon acquisition. On the Nationalist side, the biggest losses came after the conflict, when they had to let Germany exploit the country's mining resources, so until the beginning of [[World War II]] they barely had the chance to make any profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Whealey |first1=Robert H. |title=Hitler and Spain : The Nazi Role in the Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939 |date=1989 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=978-0813148632 |pages=72–94 |edition=1 |url=https://public.ebookcentral.proquest.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=1915017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain was devastated in many areas, with completely destroyed towns. The Spanish economy took decades to recover.

=== Victims ===
The number of civilian victims is still being discussed, with some estimating approximately 500,000 victims, while others go as high as 1,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Hugh |title=The Spanish Civil War |url=https://archive.org/details/spanishcivilwar00thom_0 |url-access=registration |date=2001 |page=xviii &amp; 899–901|publisher=Modern Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; These deaths were not only due to combat, but also executions, which were especially well-organised and systematic on the Nationalist side, being more disorganised on the Republican side (mainly caused by loss of control of the armed masses by the government).&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;Thomas, Hugh, ''Op.Cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the 500,000 death toll does not include deaths by malnutrition, hunger or diseases brought about by the war.

=== Francoist repression after the war and Republican exile ===
{{Main|White Terror (Spain)}}
{{also|:Category:Exiles of the Spanish Civil War}}
[[File:Los niños de Morelia. Niños españoles que encontraron en México un hogar.JPG|thumb|Spanish children in exile in [[Mexico]]]]
After the War, the Francoist regime initiated a repressive process against the losing side, a "cleansing" of sorts against anything or anyone associated with the Republic. This process led many to exile or death. 
Exile happened in three waves. The first one was during the Northern Campaign (March–November 1937), followed by a second wave after the fall of Catalonia (January–February 1939), in which about 400,000 people fled to France. The French authorities had to improvise concentration camps, with such hard conditions that almost half of the exiled Spaniards returned. The third wave occurred after the War, at the end of March 1939, when thousands of Republicans tried to board ships to exile, although few succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bahamonde |first1=Ángel |last2=Cervera Gil |first2=Javier |title=Así terminó la Guerra de year |year=1999 |publisher=Marcial Pons |location=Madrid |isbn = 84-95379-00-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International relations ===
The political and emotional repercussions of the War transcended the National scale, becoming a precursor to [[World War II]].{{sfn|Payne|2008|p=336}} The war has frequently been described as the "prelude to" or the "opening round of" the Second World War, as part of an international battle against fascism. However Stanley Payne suggests this isn't accurate, arguing that the international alliance that was created in December 1941, once the United States entered WW2, was politically much broader than the Spanish Popular Front as it included conservative capitalist states such as Great Britain and the United States; indeed it included the equivalent of many forces on Franco's side. The Spanish Civil War, Payne argues, was thus a much more clear-cut revolutionary/counterrevolutionary battle between the left and right, while the Second World War initially had the fascists and communists on the same side with the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Eastern Europe. Payne suggests that instead the civil war was the last of the revolutionary crises that emerged from the First World War, observing it had parallels such as: (1) the complete revolutionary breakdown of domestic institutions, (2) the development of full-scale revolutionary/counterrevolutionary war, (3) development of a typical post-World War One Red Army in the form of the People's Army, (4) an extreme exacerbation of nationalism, (5) frequent use of World War One style military material and concepts and (6) the fact that it was not the product of the plan of any the major powers, making it more similar to the post-First World War crises.{{sfn|Payne|2011|p=194}}{{sfn|Payne|2004|pp=313-314}}

After the War, Spanish policy leaned heavily towards Germany, Portugal and Italy, since they had been the greatest Nationalist supporters and aligned with Spain ideologically. However, the end of the Civil War and later the Second World War saw the isolation of the country from most other nations until the 1950s, in which the American anti-Communist international policy favoured having a far-right and extremely anti-communist ally in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooley |first=Alexander |title=Base Politics : Democratic Change and the U.S. Military Overseas |year=2008 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca |isbn = 978-0801446054 |pages=57–64 |url = http://search.ebscohost.com.ccl.idm.oclc.org/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nlebk&amp;AN=671393&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
