{{Macroeconomics sidebar}}
A '''financial crisis''' is any of a broad variety of situations in which some financial assets suddenly lose a large part of their nominal value. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, many financial crises were associated with [[Bank run#Systemic banking crises|banking panics]], and many [[recession]]s coincided with these panics. Other situations that are often called financial crises include [[stock market crash]]es and the [[Life Cycle of an Economic Crisis|bursting]] of other financial [[Economic bubble|bubbles]], [[currency crisis|currency crises]], and [[sovereign default]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Charles P. Kindleberger and Robert Aliber (2005), ''Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises'', 5th ed. Wiley, {{ISBN|0-471-46714-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luc Laeven and Fabian Valencia (2008), [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=22345.0 'Systemic banking crises: a new database']. International Monetary Fund Working Paper 08/224.&lt;/ref&gt; Financial crises directly result in a loss of [[paper wealth]] but do not necessarily result in significant changes in the real economy (e.g. the crisis resulting from the famous tulip mania bubble in the 17th century).

Many economists have offered theories about how financial crises develop and how they could be prevented. There is no consensus, however, and financial crises continue to occur from time to time.

==Types==

===Banking crisis===
{{Main|Bank run}}
When a bank suffers a sudden rush of withdrawals by depositors, this is called a ''bank run''. Since banks lend out most of the cash they receive in deposits (see [[fractional-reserve banking]]), it is difficult for them to quickly pay back all deposits if these are suddenly demanded, so a run renders the bank insolvent, causing customers to lose their deposits, to the extent that they are not covered by deposit insurance. An event in which bank runs are widespread is called a ''systemic banking crisis'' or ''banking panic''.&lt;ref&gt;Fratianni, M. and Marchionne, F. 2009. ''The Role of Banks in the Subprime Financial Crisis'' available on SSRN: {{cite journal |title=The Role of Banks in the Subprime Financial Crisis |df= |ssrn = 1383473|date= 10 April 2009|last1= Marchionne|first1= Francesco|last2= Fratianni|first2= Michele U.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of bank runs include the [[Great Depression#U.S. Federal Reserve and money supply|run on the Bank of the United States in 1931]] and the run on [[Northern Rock]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shin|first=Hyun Song|date=1 January 2009|title=Reflections on Northern Rock: The Bank Run that Heralded the Global Financial Crisis|journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=23|issue=1|pages=101–119|doi=10.1257/jep.23.1.101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banking crises generally occur after periods of risky lending and resulting loan defaults.

===Currency crisis===
{{main|Currency crisis}}
{{see also|Hyperinflation}}

A currency crisis, also called a devaluation crisis,&lt;ref name="theglobaleconomy.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/guide/article/74/|title=What is a currency crisis, currency crisis definition and summary {{!}} TheGlobalEconomy.com|website=TheGlobalEconomy.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-20|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002165829/http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/guide/article/74/|archivedate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is normally considered as part of a financial crisis. Kaminsky et al. (1998), for instance, define currency crises as occurring when a weighted average of monthly percentage depreciations in the exchange rate and monthly percentage declines in exchange reserves exceeds its mean by more than three standard deviations. Frankel and Rose (1996) define a currency crisis as a nominal depreciation of a currency of at least 25% but it is also defined as at least a 10% increase in the rate of depreciation. In general, a currency crisis can be defined as a situation when the participants in an exchange market come to recognize that a [[pegged exchange rate]] is about to fail, causing [[speculation]] against the peg that hastens the failure and forces a [[devaluation]].&lt;ref name="theglobaleconomy.com"/&gt;

===Speculative bubbles and crashes===
{{Main|Economic bubble|Irrational exuberance|Credit cycle|Credit crunch|Liquidity crisis}}
{{See also|Diamond rush|Gold rush|Oil boom|List of commodity booms|Minsky moment|Real estate bubble|Stock market bubble|Stock market crash}}
A speculative bubble exists in the event of large, sustained overpricing of some class of assets.&lt;ref&gt;Markus Brunnermeier (2008), 'Bubbles', in ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt; One factor that frequently contributes to a bubble is the presence of buyers who purchase an asset based solely on the expectation that they can later resell it at a higher price, rather than calculating the income it will generate in the future. If there is a bubble, there is also a risk of a ''crash'' in asset prices: market participants will go on buying only as long as they expect others to buy, and when many decide to sell the price will fall. However, it is difficult to predict whether an asset's price actually equals its fundamental value, so it is hard to detect bubbles reliably. Some economists insist that bubbles never or almost never occur.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Garber (2001), ''Famous First Bubbles: The Fundamentals of Early Manias''. MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-57153-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Schwarzer Freitag Wien 1873.jpg|thumb|Black Friday, 9 May 1873, Vienna Stock Exchange. The [[Panic of 1873]] and [[Long Depression]] followed.]]
Well-known examples of bubbles (or purported bubbles) and crashes in stock prices and other asset prices include the 17th century Dutch [[tulip mania]], the 18th century [[Bubble Act|South Sea Bubble]], the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the [[Japanese asset price bubble|Japanese property bubble]] of the 1980s, the crash of the [[dot-com bubble]] in 2000–2001, and the now-deflating [[United States housing bubble]].&lt;ref name="Moyers Morgenson"&gt;{{cite episode |number = 06292007 | series = [[Bill Moyers Journal]] | network = [[PBS]] | url = https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/06292007/transcript5.html |title=Transcript| airdate = 2007-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ Housing Bubble Burst"&gt;{{cite news | author = Justin Lahart | title = Egg Cracks Differ In Housing, Finance Shells | publisher = [[WSJ.com]] | work = [[Wall Street Journal]] | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119845906460548071?mod=googlenews_wsj | date = 24 December 2007 | accessdate = 2008-07-13 | quote = It's now conventional wisdom that a housing bubble has burst.

Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/214013947/13AAB36905E4EBC93F5/4&lt;/ref&gt;

===International financial crisis===
{{Main|Currency crisis|Debt crisis|Sovereign default}}
When a country that maintains a [[fixed exchange rate]] is suddenly forced to [[devaluation|devalue]] its currency due to accruing an unsustainable current account deficit, this is called a ''currency crisis'' or ''balance of payments crisis''. When a country fails to pay back its [[sovereign debt]], this is called a ''sovereign default''. While devaluation and default could both be voluntary decisions of the government, they are often perceived to be the involuntary results of a change in investor sentiment that leads to a [[Sudden stop (economics)|sudden stop]] in capital inflows or a sudden increase in [[capital flight]].

Several currencies that formed part of the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]] suffered crises in 1992–93 and were forced to devalue or withdraw from the mechanism. Another round of currency crises took place in [[Asian financial crisis|Asia in 1997–98]]. Many [[Latin American debt crisis|Latin American countries defaulted]] on their debt in the early 1980s. The [[1998 Russian financial crisis]] resulted in a devaluation of the ruble and default on Russian government bonds.

===Wider economic crisis===
{{Main|Recession|Depression (economics)}}
Negative GDP growth lasting two or more quarters is called a ''recession''. An especially prolonged or severe recession may be called a ''depression'', while a long period of slow but not necessarily negative growth is sometimes called [[economic stagnation]].

[[File:Financialcrisisconsumerspendings.JPG|thumb|right|Declining consumer spending.]]
Some economists argue that many recessions have been caused in large part by financial crises. One important example is the [[Great Depression]], which was preceded in many countries by bank runs and stock market crashes. The [[subprime mortgage crisis]] and the bursting of other real estate bubbles around the world also led to recession in the U.S. and a number of other countries in late 2008 and 2009.
Some economists argue that financial crises are caused by recessions instead of the other way around, and that even where a financial crisis is the initial shock that sets off a recession, other factors may be more important in prolonging the recession. In particular, [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]] [[A Monetary History of the United States|argued]] that the initial economic decline associated with the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|crash of 1929]] and the bank panics of the 1930s would not have turned into a prolonged depression if it had not been reinforced by monetary policy mistakes on the part of the Federal Reserve,&lt;ref&gt;Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz (1971), ''A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960''. Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-00354-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a position supported by [[Ben Bernanke]].&lt;ref&gt;'1929 and all that', ''The Economist'', 2 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes and consequences==

===Strategic complementarities in financial markets===
{{Main|Strategic complementarity|Self-fulfilling prophecy}}
It is often observed that successful investment requires each investor in a financial market to guess what other investors will do. [[George Soros#Philosophy|George Soros]] has called this need to guess the intentions of others '[[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharpeinvesting.com/2007/08/george-soros-theory-of-reflexivity-mit-speech.html 'The Theory of Reflexivity', speech by George Soros, April 1994 at MIT.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228182116/http://www.sharpeinvesting.com/2007/08/george-soros-theory-of-reflexivity-mit-speech.html |date=28 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[John Maynard Keynes]] compared financial markets to a [[Keynesian beauty contest|beauty contest game]] in which each participant tries to predict which model ''other'' participants will consider most beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Keynes (1936), ''The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money'', Chapter 12. (New York: Harcourt Brace and Co.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, in many cases investors have incentives to [[coordination game|coordinate]] their choices. For example, someone who thinks other investors want to buy lots of [[Japanese yen]] may expect the yen to rise in value, and therefore has an incentive to buy yen too. Likewise, a depositor in [[IndyMac Bank]] who expects other depositors to withdraw their funds may expect the bank to fail, and therefore has an incentive to withdraw too. Economists call an incentive to mimic the strategies of others ''strategic complementarity''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bulow, J. Geanakoplos, and P. Klemperer (1985), 'Multimarket oligopoly: strategic substitutes and strategic complements'. ''Journal of Political Economy'' 93, pp. 488–511.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that if people or firms have a sufficiently strong incentive to do the same thing they expect others to do, then ''self-fulfilling prophecies'' may occur.&lt;ref&gt;R. Cooper  and A. John (1988), 'Coordinating coordination failures in Keynesian models.' ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' 103 (3), pp. 441–63. See especially Propositions 1 and 3.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if investors expect the value of the yen to rise, this may cause its value to rise; if depositors expect a bank to fail this may cause it to fail.&lt;ref name="diamonddybvig1983"&gt;D. Diamond and P. Dybvig (1983), 'Bank runs, deposit insurance, and liquidity'. ''Journal of Political Economy'' 91 (3), pp. 401–19. [http://minneapolisfed.org/research/QR/QR2412.pdf Reprinted] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829034454/http://minneapolisfed.org/research/QR/QR2412.pdf |date=29 August 2012 }} (2000) in ''Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Quarterly Review'' 24 (1), pp. 14–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, financial crises are sometimes viewed as a [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] in which investors shun some institution or asset because they expect others to do so.&lt;ref name="obstfeld1996"&gt;M. Obstfeld (1996), 'Models of currency crises with self-fulfilling features'. ''European Economic Review'' 40 (3–5), pp. 1037–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leverage===
{{Main|Leverage (finance)}}
''Leverage'', which means borrowing to finance investments, is frequently cited as a contributor to financial crises. When a financial institution (or an individual) only invests its own money, it can, in the very worst case, lose its own money. But when it borrows in order to invest more, it can potentially earn more from its investment, but it can also lose more than all it has. Therefore, leverage magnifies the potential returns from investment, but also creates a risk of [[bankruptcy]]. Since bankruptcy means that a firm fails to honor all its promised payments to other firms, it may spread financial troubles from one firm to another (see [[Financial crisis#Contagion|'Contagion']] below).

The average degree of leverage in the economy often rises prior to a financial crisis.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} For example, borrowing to finance investment in the [[stock market]] ("[[Margin (finance)#Margin buying|margin buying]]") became increasingly common prior to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].

===Asset-liability mismatch===
{{Main|Asset-liability mismatch}}
Another factor believed to contribute to financial crises is ''asset-liability mismatch'', a situation in which the risks associated with an institution's debts and assets are not appropriately aligned. For example, commercial banks offer deposit accounts which can be withdrawn at any time and they use the proceeds to make long-term loans to businesses and homeowners. The mismatch between the banks' short-term liabilities (its deposits) and its long-term assets (its loans) is seen as one of the reasons [[bank run]]s occur (when depositors panic and decide to withdraw their funds more quickly than the bank can get back the proceeds of its loans).&lt;ref name="diamonddybvig1983" /&gt; Likewise, [[Bear Stearns]] failed in 2007–08 because it was unable to renew the [[money market|short-term debt]] it used to finance long-term investments in mortgage securities.

In an international context, many emerging market governments are unable to sell bonds denominated in their own currencies, and therefore sell bonds denominated in US dollars instead. This generates a mismatch between the currency denomination of their liabilities (their bonds) and their assets (their local tax revenues), so that they run a risk of [[sovereign default]] due to fluctuations in exchange rates.&lt;ref&gt;Eichengreen and Hausmann (2005), ''Other People's Money: Debt Denomination and Financial Instability in Emerging Market Economies''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uncertainty and herd behavior===
{{Main|Economic psychology|Herd behavior}}
Many analyses of financial crises emphasize the role of investment mistakes caused by lack of knowledge or the imperfections of human reasoning. [[Behavioral finance|Behavioural finance]] studies errors in economic and quantitative reasoning. Psychologist Torbjorn K A Eliazon has also analyzed failures of economic reasoning in his concept of 'œcopathy'.&lt;ref&gt;Torbjörn K A Eliazon (2006) [http://www.eliazon.eu/] –
Om Emotionell intelligens och Œcopati (ekopati)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians, notably [[Charles P. Kindleberger]], have pointed out that crises often follow soon after major financial or technical innovations that present investors with new types of financial opportunities, which he called "displacements" of investors' expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Kindleberger and Aliber (2005), op. cit., pp. 54–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_TJNPQGN  'Of manias, panics, and crashes'],
obituary of Charles Kindleberger in ''The Economist'', 17 July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples include the [[South Sea Bubble]] and [[Mississippi Bubble]] of 1720, which occurred when the notion of investment in shares of company [[stock]] was itself new and unfamiliar,&lt;ref&gt;Kindleberger and Aliber (2005), op. cit., p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Crash of 1929]], which followed the introduction of new electrical and transportation technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Kindleberger and Aliber (2005), op. cit., p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, many financial crises followed changes in the investment environment brought about by financial [[deregulation]], and the crash of the [[dot com bubble]] in 2001 arguably began with "irrational exuberance" about Internet technology.&lt;ref&gt;Kindleberger
and Aliber (2005), op. cit., p. 26 and pp. 160–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfamiliarity with recent technical and [[financial innovation]]s may help explain how investors sometimes grossly overestimate asset values. Also, if the first investors in a new class of assets (for example, stock in "dot com" companies) profit from rising asset values as other investors learn about the innovation (in our example, as others learn about the potential of the Internet), then still more others may follow their example, driving the price even higher as they rush to buy in hopes of similar profits. If such "herd behaviour" causes prices to spiral up far above the true value of the assets, a crash may become inevitable. If for any reason the price briefly falls, so that investors realize that further gains are not assured, then the spiral may go into reverse, with price decreases causing a rush of sales, reinforcing the decrease in prices.

===Regulatory failures===
{{Main|Financial regulation|Bank regulation}}
Governments have attempted to eliminate or mitigate financial crises by regulating the financial sector. One major goal of regulation is [[Transparency (market)|transparency]]: making institutions' financial situations publicly known by requiring regular reporting under standardized accounting procedures. Another goal of regulation is making sure institutions have sufficient assets to meet their contractual obligations, through [[reserve requirement]]s, [[capital requirement]]s, and other limits on [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]].

Some financial crises have been blamed on insufficient regulation, and have led to changes in regulation in order to avoid a repeat. For example, the former Managing Director of the [[International Monetary Fund]], [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]], has blamed the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]] on 'regulatory failure to guard against excessive risk-taking in the financial system, especially in the US'.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss Kahn D, 'A systemic crisis demands systemic solutions', ''The Financial Times'', 25 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the New York Times singled out the deregulation of [[credit default swap]]s as a cause of the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/28/opinion/28sun1.html?ref=opinion 'Don't blame the New Deal'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229054617/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/28/opinion/28sun1.html?ref=opinion |date=29 December 2016 }}, ''New York Times'', 28 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, excessive regulation has also been cited as a possible cause of financial crises. In particular, the [[Basel II Accord]] has been criticized for requiring banks to increase their capital when risks rise, which might cause them to decrease lending precisely when capital is scarce, potentially aggravating a financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Gordy MB and Howells B (2004), [http://www.bis.org/bcbs/events/rtf04gordy_howells.pdf 'Procyclicality in Basel II: can we treat the disease without killing the patient?'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218145609/http://www.bis.org/bcbs/events/rtf04gordy_howells.pdf |date=18 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

International regulatory convergence has been interpreted in terms of regulatory herding, deepening market herding (discussed above) and so increasing systemic risk.&lt;ref name="risk1"&gt;George Kaufman and Kenneth Scott (2003),[http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_07_3_scott.pdf 'What is systemic risk, and do bank regulators retard or contribute to it?'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909210153/http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_07_3_scott.pdf |date=9 September 2008 }} ''The Independent Review'' 7 (3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorn N (2010), The Governance of Securities: Ponzi Finance, Regulatory Convergence, Credit Crunch, British Journal of Criminology, volume 50, issue 1, January, pp 23–45&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, maintaining diverse regulatory regimes would be a safeguard.

Fraud has played a role in the collapse of some financial institutions, when companies have attracted depositors with misleading claims about their investment strategies, or have [[embezzlement|embezzled]] the resulting income. Examples include [[Charles Ponzi]]'s scam in early 20th century Boston, the collapse of the [[MMM (Ponzi scheme)|MMM]] investment fund in Russia in 1994, the scams that led to the [[1997 rebellion in Albania|Albanian Lottery Uprising]] of 1997, and the collapse of [[Bernard Madoff|Madoff Investment Securities]] in 2008.

Many [[rogue trader]]s that have caused large losses at financial institutions have been accused of acting fraudulently in order to hide their trades. Fraud in mortgage financing has also been cited as one possible cause of the 2008 [[subprime mortgage crisis]]; government officials stated on 23 September 2008 that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] was looking into possible fraud by mortgage financing companies [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]], [[Lehman Brothers]], and insurer [[American International Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/23/news/companies/fbi_finance.ap/index.htm?cnn=yes 'FBI probing bailout firms'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926001808/http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/23/news/companies/fbi_finance.ap/index.htm?cnn=yes |date=26 September 2008 }}, CNN Money, 23 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise it has been argued that many financial companies failed in the recent crisis &lt;which "recent crisis?"&gt; because their managers failed to carry out their fiduciary duties.&lt;ref&gt;Kothari, Vinay (2010). Executive Greed: Examining Business Failures that Contributed to the Economic Crisis. New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contagion===
{{Main|Financial contagion|Systemic risk}}
''[[Life Cycle of an Economic Crisis|Contagion]]'' refers to the idea that financial crises may spread from one institution to another, as when a bank run spreads from a few banks to many others, or from one country to another, as when currency crises, sovereign defaults, or stock market crashes spread across countries. When the failure of one particular financial institution threatens the stability of many other institutions, this is called ''systemic risk''.&lt;ref name="risk1"/&gt;

One widely cited example of contagion was the spread of the [[Asian financial crisis#Thailand|Thai crisis in 1997]] to other countries like [[South Korea]]. However, economists often debate whether observing crises in many countries around the same time is truly caused by contagion from one market to another, or whether it is instead caused by similar underlying problems that would have affected each country individually even in the absence of international linkages.

===Recessionary effects===
Some financial crises have little effect outside of the financial sector, like the [[Black Monday (1987)|Wall Street crash of 1987]], but other crises are believed to have played a role in decreasing growth in the rest of the economy. There are many theories why a financial crisis could have a recessionary effect on the rest of the economy. These theoretical ideas include the '[[financial accelerator]]', '[[flight to quality]]' and '[[flight to liquidity]]', and the [[Kiyotaki-Moore model]]. Some [[Currency crisis#Theories of currency crises|'third generation' models of currency crises]] explore how currency crises and banking crises together can cause recessions.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Burnside, Martin Eichenbaum, and Sergio Rebelo (2008), '[http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/rebelo/htm/currency%20crisis%20models%20Ed.pdf Currency crisis models]', ''New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Austrian theories===
{{Main|Austrian business cycle theory}}
[[Austrian School]] economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek discussed the business cycle starting with Mises' ''Theory of Money and Credit'', published in 1912.

===Marxist theories===
{{Main|Crisis (Marxian)}}
Recurrent major depressions in the world economy at the pace of 20 and 50 years have been the subject of studies since [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi]] (1773–1842) provided the first theory of crisis in a critique of classical political economy's assumption of equilibrium between supply and demand. Developing an economic [[crisis theory]] became the central recurring concept throughout [[Karl Marx]]'s mature work. Marx's [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|law of the tendency for the rate of profit to fall]] borrowed many features of the presentation of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s discussion ''Of the Tendency of Profits to a Minimum'' (Principles of Political Economy Book IV Chapter IV). The theory is a corollary of the ''Tendency towards the Centralization of Profits''.

In a capitalist system, successfully-operating businesses return less money to their workers (in the form of wages) than the value of the goods produced by those workers (i.e. the amount of money the products are sold for). This [[profit (economics)|profit]] first goes towards covering the initial investment in the business. In the long-run, however, when one considers the combined economic activity of all successfully-operating business, it is clear that less money (in the form of wages) is being returned to the mass of the population (the workers) than is available to them to buy all of these goods being produced. Furthermore, the expansion of businesses in the process of competing for markets leads to an abundance of goods and a general fall in their prices, further exacerbating ''the tendency for the rate of profit to fall''.

The viability of this theory depends upon two main factors: firstly, the degree to which profit is taxed by government and returned to the mass of people in the form of welfare, family benefits and health and education spending; and secondly, the proportion of the population who are workers rather than investors/business owners. Given the extraordinary capital expenditure required to enter modern economic sectors like airline transport, the military industry, or chemical production, these sectors are extremely difficult for new businesses to enter and are being concentrated in fewer and fewer hands.

Empirical and econometric research continues especially in the [[world systems theory]] and in the debate about [[Nikolai Kondratiev]] and the so-called 50-years [[Kondratiev waves]]. Major figures of world systems theory, like [[Andre Gunder Frank]] and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], consistently warned about the crash that the world economy is now facing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} World systems scholars and Kondratiev cycle researchers always implied that [[Washington Consensus]] oriented economists never understood the dangers and perils, which leading industrial nations will be facing and are now facing at the end of the long [[economic cycle]] which began after the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] of 1973.

===Minsky's theory===
[[Hyman Minsky]] has proposed a [[post-Keynesian economics|post-Keynesian]] explanation that is most applicable to a closed economy. He theorized that [[financial fragility]] is a typical feature of any [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[economy]]. High fragility leads to a higher risk of a financial crisis. To facilitate his analysis, Minsky defines three approaches to financing firms may choose, according to their tolerance of risk. They are hedge finance, speculative finance, and [[Ponzi]] finance. Ponzi finance leads to the most fragility.
* for hedge finance, income flows are expected to meet financial obligations in every period, including both the principal and the interest on loans.
* for speculative finance, a firm must roll over debt because income flows are expected to only cover interest costs. None of the principal is paid off.
* for Ponzi finance, expected income flows will not even cover interest cost, so the firm must borrow more or sell off assets simply to service its debt. The hope is that either the market value of assets or income will rise enough to pay off interest and principal.

Financial fragility levels move together with the [[business cycle]]. After a [[recession]], firms have lost much financing and choose only hedge, the safest. As the economy grows and expected [[profit (economics)|profits]] rise, firms tend to believe that they can allow themselves to take on speculative financing. In this case, they know that profits will not cover all the [[interest]] all the time. Firms, however, believe that profits will rise and the loans will eventually be repaid without much trouble. More loans lead to more investment, and the economy grows further. Then lenders also start believing that they will get back all the money they lend. Therefore, they are ready to lend to firms without full guarantees of success.

Lenders know that such firms will have problems repaying. Still, they believe these firms will refinance from elsewhere as their expected profits rise. This is Ponzi financing. In this way, the economy has taken on much risky credit. Now it is only a question of time before some big firm actually defaults. Lenders understand the actual risks in the economy and stop giving credit so easily. [[Refinancing]] becomes impossible for many, and more firms default. If no new money comes into the economy to allow the refinancing process, a real economic crisis begins. During the recession, firms start to hedge again, and the cycle is closed.

===Coordination games===
{{Main|Coordination game}}
Mathematical approaches to modeling financial crises have emphasized that there is often [[positive feedback]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/opinion/27krugman.html?hp 'The widening gyre'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229052459/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/opinion/27krugman.html?hp |date=29 December 2016 }}, Paul Krugman, ''New York Times'', 27 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; between market participants' decisions (see [[strategic complementarity]]).&lt;ref&gt;R. Cooper (1998), ''Coordination Games''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Positive feedback implies that there may be dramatic changes in asset values in response to small changes in economic fundamentals. For example, some models of currency crises (including that of [[Paul Krugman]]) imply that a fixed exchange rate may be stable for a long period of time, but will collapse suddenly in an [[speculative attack|avalanche of currency sales]] in response to a sufficient deterioration of government finances or underlying economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;P. Krugman (1979), 'A model of balance-of-payments crises'. ''Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking'' 11, pp. 311–25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Morris and H. Shin (1998), 'Unique equilibrium in a model of self-fulfilling currency attacks'. ''American Economic Review'' 88 (3), pp. 587–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some theories, positive feedback implies that the economy can have more than one [[Nash equilibrium|equilibrium]]. There may be an equilibrium in which market participants invest heavily in asset markets because they expect assets to be valuable. This is the type of argument underlying [[Diamond-Dybvig model|Diamond and Dybvig's model]] of [[bank run]]s, in which savers withdraw their assets from the bank because they expect others to withdraw too.&lt;ref name="diamonddybvig1983" /&gt; Likewise, in [[Currency crisis#Theories|Obstfeld's model of currency crises]], when economic conditions are neither too bad nor too good, there are two possible outcomes: speculators may or may not decide to attack the currency depending on what they expect other speculators to do.&lt;ref name="obstfeld1996" /&gt;

===Herding models and learning models===
{{Main|Herd behavior|Adaptive expectations}}
A variety of models have been developed in which asset values may spiral excessively up or down as investors learn from each other. In these models, asset purchases by a few agents encourage others to buy too, not because the true value of the asset increases when many buy (which is called "strategic complementarity"), but because investors come to believe the true asset value is high when they observe others buying.

In "herding" models, it is assumed that investors are fully rational, but only have partial information about the economy. In these models, when a few investors buy some type of asset, this reveals that they have some positive information about that asset, which increases the rational incentive of others to buy the asset too. Even though this is a fully rational decision, it may sometimes lead to mistakenly high asset values (implying, eventually, a crash) since the first investors may, by chance, have been mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;A. Banerjee (1992), 'A simple model of herd behavior'."Quarterly Journal of Economics" 107 (3), pp. 797–817.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Bikhchandani, D. Hirshleifer, and I. Welch (1992),'A theory of fads, fashions, custom, and cultural change as informational cascades'."Journal of Political Economy" 100 (5), pp. 992–1026.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. Chari and P. Kehoe (2004), 'Financial crises as herds: overturning the critiques'. "Journal of Economic Theory" 119, pp. 128–150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Avery and P. Zemsky (1998), ' Multidimensional Uncertainty and Herd Behavior in Financial Markets'. "American Economic Review" 88, pp. 724–748.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Cipriani and A. Guarino (2008) 'Herd Behavior and Contagion in Financial Markets'. "The B.E. Journal of Theoretical Economics" 8(1) (Contributions), Article 24, pp. 1–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Herding models, based on [[Complex systems|Complexity Science]], indicate that it is the internal structure of the market, not external influences, which is primarily responsible for crashes.&lt;ref name=plosone&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0131871 |pmid=26185988 |pmc=4506134 |bibcode=2015PLoSO..1031871H |title=Anticipating Economic Market Crises Using Measures of Collective Panic |year=2015 |last1=Harmon |first1=Dion |last2=Lagi |first2=Marco |last3=De Aguiar |first3=Marcus A.

In "adaptive learning" or "adaptive expectations" models, investors are assumed to be imperfectly rational, basing their reasoning only on recent experience. In such models, if the price of a given asset rises for some period of time, investors may begin to believe that its price always rises, which increases their tendency to buy and thus drives the price up further. Likewise, observing a few price decreases may give rise to a downward price spiral, so in models of this type large fluctuations in asset prices may occur. [[Agent-Based Computational Economics|Agent-based models]] of financial markets often assume investors act on the basis of adaptive learning or adaptive expectations.

{{See also|List of banking crises|List of economic crises}}
[[File:South Sea Bubble Cards-Tree.png|thumb|upright|The bursting of the [[South Sea Bubble]] and [[Mississippi Bubble]] in 1720 is regarded as the first modern financial crisis.]]
A noted survey of financial crises is ''This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly'' {{Harv|Reinhart|Rogoff|2009}}, by economists [[Carmen Reinhart]] and [[Kenneth Rogoff]], who are regarded as among the foremost historians of financial crises.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703323704574602030789251824 What a Sovereign-Debt Crisis Could Mean for You], "Prof. Rogoff and his longtime collaborator Carmen Reinhart, at the University of Maryland, probably know more about the history of financial crises than anyone alive."&lt;/ref&gt; In this survey, they trace the history of financial crisis back to [[sovereign default]]s – default on ''public'' debt, – which were the form of crisis prior to the 18th century and continue, then and now causing private bank failures; crises since the 18th century feature both public debt default and private debt default. Reinhart and Rogoff also class [[debasement]] of currency and [[hyperinflation]] as being forms of financial crisis, broadly speaking, because they lead to unilateral reduction (repudiation) of debt.

===Prior to 19th century===
[[File:8denarii.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman empire|Roman]] [[denarius]] was debased over time.]]
[[File:Portrait of Philip II of Spain by Sofonisba Anguissola - 002b.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Philip II of Spain]] defaulted four times on Spain's debt.]]
Reinhart and Rogoff trace inflation (to reduce debt) to [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius of Syracuse]], of the 4th century BC, and begin their "eight centuries" in 1258; debasement of currency also occurred under the [[Roman empire]] and [[Byzantine empire]].

Among the earliest crises Reinhart and Rogoff study is the 1340 default of England, due to setbacks in its war with France (the [[Hundred Years' War]]; see [[Hundred Years' War (1337–1360)#Low Countries (1337–1341)|details]]). Further early sovereign defaults include seven defaults by imperial Spain, four under [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], three under his successors.

Other global and national financial mania since the 17th century include:
* 1637: Bursting of [[tulip mania]] in the Netherlands – while tulip mania is popularly reported as an example of a financial crisis, and was a speculative bubble, [[Tulip mania#Modern views|modern scholarship]] holds that its broader economic impact was limited to negligible, and that it did not precipitate a financial crisis.
* 1720: Bursting of [[South Sea Bubble]] (Great Britain) and [[Mississippi Bubble]] (France) – earliest of modern financial crises; in both cases the company assumed the national debt of the country (80–85% in Great Britain, 100% in France), and thereupon the bubble burst. The resulting crisis of confidence probably had a deep impact on the financial and political development of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/node/14215012|title=Law of easy money|date=13 August 2009|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Amsterdam banking crisis of 1763|Crisis of 1763]] - started in Amsterdam, begun by the collapse of [[Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky]] and [[Leendert Pieter de Neufville]]'s bank, spread to Germany and Scandinavia.
* [[Crisis of 1772]] – in London and Amsterdam. 20 important banks in London went bankrupt after one banking house defaulted (bankers Neal, James, Fordyce and Down)
* France's Financial and Debt Crisis (1783–1788)- France severe financial crisis due to the immense debt accrued through the French involvement in the Seven Years' War (1756–1763) and the American Revolution (1775-1783).
* [[Panic of 1792]] – run on banks in US precipitated by the expansion of credit by the newly formed Bank of the United States
