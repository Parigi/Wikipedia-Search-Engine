The [[Macintosh 128k|original Macintosh]] is the first successful mass-market personal computer to have featured a graphical user interface, built-in screen, and mouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Polsson |first=Ken |url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/applehis/appl1984.htm |title=Chronology of Apple Computer Personal Computers |date=July 29, 2009 |accessdate= August 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090821105822/http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/applehis/appl1984.htm |archivedate= August 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple sold the Macintosh alongside its popular [[Apple II]] family of computers for almost ten years until the latter was discontinued in 1993.

Early Macintosh models were expensive,&lt;ref name=unvlmcin&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pVdWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7e4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5088%2C4154157 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Apple unveils a Macintosh |date=January 24, 1984 |page=C6}}&lt;/ref&gt; hindering competitiveness in a market dominated by the much cheaper [[Commodore 64]] for consumers, as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying [[IBM PC compatible|clone]] market for businesses,&lt;ref name="arstech"&gt;{{cite web |last= Reimer |first= Jeremy |title= Total share: 30 years of personal computer market share figures |website= [[Ars Technica]]  |date= December 14, 2005 |url= https://arstechnica.com/features/2005/12/total-share/5/ |accessdate= April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they were less expensive than the [[Xerox Alto]] and other computers with graphical user interfaces that predated the Mac. Macintosh systems were successful in education and desktop publishing, making Apple the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade. In the early 1990s, Apple introduced the Macintosh LC II and [[Macintosh Color Classic|Color Classic]] which were price-competitive with Wintel machines at the time.

However, the introduction of [[Windows 3.1]] and Intel's [[Pentium]] processor, which beat the [[Motorola 68040]] used in then-current Macintoshes in most benchmarks, gradually took market share from Apple, and by the end of 1994 Apple was relegated to third place as [[Compaq]] became the top PC manufacturer. Even after the transition to the superior [[PowerPC]]-based [[Power Macintosh]] line in the mid-1990s, the falling prices of commodity PC components, poor inventory management with the [[Macintosh Performa]], and the release of [[Windows 95]] contributed to continued decline of the Macintosh user base.

Upon his return to the company, [[Steve Jobs]] led Apple to consolidate the complex line of nearly twenty Macintosh models in mid-1997 (including models made for specific regions) down to four in mid-1999: the Power Macintosh G3, iMac, 14.1" [[PowerBook G3]], and 12" [[iBook]]. All four products were critically and commercially successful due to their high performance, competitive prices, and aesthetic designs, and helped return Apple to profitability.

Around this time, Apple phased out the Macintosh name in favor of "Mac", a nickname that had been in common use since the development of the first model. Since their [[Apple's transition to Intel processors|transition to Intel processors]] in 2006, the complete lineup is Intel-based.

Its current lineup includes four [[Desktop computers|desktops]] (the all-in-one [[iMac]] and [[iMac Pro]], and the desktop [[Mac Mini]] and [[Mac Pro]]), and two [[Laptop computer|laptops]] (the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro). Its [[Xserve]] [[server (computing)|server]] was discontinued in 2011 in favor of the Mac Mini and Mac Pro.

Apple has developed a series of Macintosh operating systems. The first versions initially had no name but came to be known as the "Macintosh System Software" in 1988, "Mac OS" in 1997 with the release of [[Mac OS 7.6]], and retrospectively called "[[Classic Mac OS]]". Apple produced a Unix-based operating system for the Macintosh called [[A/UX]] from 1988 to 1995, which closely resembled contemporary versions of the Macintosh system software. Apple does not [[Software license agreement|license]] macOS for use on non-Apple computers, however, System 7 was licensed to various companies through Apple's Macintosh clone program from 1995 to 1997. Only one company, UMAX Technologies was legally licensed to ship clones running Mac OS 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/umax-gains-mac-os-8-license/|title=Umax gains Mac OS 8 license|date=1997-09-08|work=CNET|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Apple released Mac OS X, a modern Unix-based operating system which was later rebranded to simply OS X in 2012, and then macOS in 2016. The current version is [[macOS Catalina]], released on October 7, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/07/apple-releases-macos-catalina/|title=Apple Releases macOS Catalina With Find My, Screen Time, and No More iTunes|date=2019-10-07|work=MacRumors|access-date=2019-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intel-based Macs are capable of running native third party operating systems such as [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], and Microsoft Windows with the aid of [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] or third-party software. Volunteer communities have customized Intel-based macOS to run illicitly on non-Apple computers.  Apple is rumored to be developing its own Apple-designed [[ARM architecture|ARM]] processors for future Macintoshes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/3447216/apple-plans-its-own-mac-processors-report-claims.html|title=Apple plans its own Mac processors, report claims|first=Jonny|last=Evans|website=[[Computerworld]]|date=October 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naming ==

The Macintosh project began in 1979 when [[Jef Raskin]], an Apple employee, envisioned an easy-to-use, low-cost computer for the average consumer. He wanted to name the computer after his favorite type of apple, the [[McIntosh (apple)|McIntosh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mxmora.best.vwh.net/JefRaskin.html |title=Recollections of the Macintosh project |accessdate=November 27, 2008 |first=Jef |last=Raskin |year=1996 |work=Articles from Jef Raskin about the history of the Macintosh. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928072214/http://jef.raskincenter.org/published/holes.html |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the spelling was changed to "Macintosh" for legal reasons as the original was the same spelling as that used by [[McIntosh Laboratory]], Inc., the audio equipment manufacturer.&lt;ref name="raskin198405"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Iyb4f_GMLWI3fgg2nPaAIsVtyWI9FA-UR5Nw-yqOLE/edit?usp=sharing |title= More Mac Reactions |work= [[BYTE]] |date=May 1984 |accessdate= October 23, 2013 |author= Raskin, Jef |pages= 20 |type= letter}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Jobs]] requested that McIntosh Laboratory give Apple a release for the newly spelled name, thus allowing Apple to use it. The request was denied, forcing Apple to eventually buy the rights to use this name.&lt;ref&gt;Apple confidential 2.0: the definitive history of the world's most colorful company, Owen W. Linzmayer, {{ISBN|978-1-59327-010-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A 1984 ''[[Byte Magazine]]'' article suggested Apple changed the spelling only after "early users" misspelled "McIntosh".&lt;ref name="williams198402"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-02/1984_02_BYTE_09-02_Benchmarks#page/n31/mode/2up |title= The Apple Macintosh Computer |work=BYTE |date= February 1984 |accessdate= October 22, 2013 |author= Williams, Gregg |pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jef Raskin had adopted the "Macintosh" spelling by 1981,&lt;ref&gt;Raskin, Jef. "Working with/for Steve Jobs". February 19, 1981, pp. 1, 3 &amp; 5.&lt;/ref&gt; when the Macintosh computer was still a single prototype machine in the lab. This explanation further clashes with the first explanation given above that the change was made for "legal reasons.")

=== 1978–84: Development and introduction ===

[[File:Early Macintosh Prototype Computer History Museum Mountain View California 2013-04-11 23-45.jpg|thumb|right|A prototype of the Macintosh from 1981 (at the [[Computer History Museum]])]]
[[File:Apple Macintosh Desktop.png|thumb |alt=A screenshot of the original Macintosh desktop.|The original Macintosh featured a radically new [[graphical user interface]]. Users interacted with the computer using a [[Desktop metaphor|metaphorical desktop]] that included [[Computer icon|icons]] of [[real life]] items, instead of abstract textual [[Command-line interface|commands]].]]
In 1978 Apple began to organize the [[Apple Lisa]] project, aiming to build a next-generation machine similar to an advanced [[Apple II]] or the yet-to-be-introduced [[IBM PC]]. In 1979 Steve Jobs learned of the advanced work on [[graphical user interface]]s (GUI) taking place at [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]]. He arranged for Apple engineers to be allowed to visit PARC to see the systems in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Horn |first=Bruce |url= http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=On_Xerox,_Apple_and_Progress.txt |publisher=Folklore.org |title= On Xerox, Apple and Progress |accessdate= February 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple Lisa project was immediately redirected to utilize a GUI, which at that time was well beyond the [[state of the art]] for [[microprocessor]] capabilities; the [[Xerox Alto]] required a custom processor that spanned several [[circuit board]]s in a case which was the size of a small refrigerator. Things had changed dramatically with the introduction of the 16/32-bit [[Motorola 68000]] in 1979, which offered at least an [[order of magnitude]] better performance than existing designs and made a software GUI machine a practical possibility. The basic layout of the Lisa was largely complete by 1982, at which point Jobs's continual suggestions for improvements led to him being kicked off the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Simon |first=Jeffrey S. Young, William L. |title= iCon : Steve Jobs, the greatest second act in the history of business |publisher= [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] (retrieved via Google Books) |location= Hoboken, NJ |isbn= 978-0-471-78784-6 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Qv6RHwAACAAJ |edition= Newly updated. |accessdate= 2014-01-06 |date= 2006-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time that the Lisa was becoming a GUI machine in 1979,  [[Jef Raskin]] started the Macintosh project. The design at that time was for a low-cost, easy-to-use machine for the average consumer. Instead of a GUI, it intended to use a [[text-based user interface]] that allowed several programs to be running and easily switched between, and special command keys on the [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] that accessed standardized commands in the programs. Raskin was authorized to start hiring for the project in September 1979,&lt;ref name="Father of Mac"&gt;{{cite web |last= Hertzfeld |first= Andy |authorlink= Andy Hertzfeld |url= http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=The_Father_of_The_Macintosh.txt&amp;showcomments=1#comments |publisher= Folklore.org |title= The father of the Macintosh |accessdate= April 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he immediately asked his long-time colleague, Brian Howard, to join him.&lt;ref name="Eulogy for Brian"&gt;{{cite web |last= Hertzfeld |first=Andy |authorlink= Andy Hertzfeld |url= http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Eulogy_for_Brian&amp;sortOrder=Sort+by+Date&amp;characters=Brian+Howardcomments=1#comments |publisher= Folklore.org |title= Eulogy for Brian |accessdate= April 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His initial team would eventually consist of himself, Howard, [[Joanna Hoffman]], [[Burrell Smith]], and [[Bud Tribble]].&lt;ref name=hertz2&gt;{{cite book |last= Hertzfeld |first=Andy |title=[[Revolution in the Valley: The Insanely Great Story of How the Mac Was Made]] |url= |location= |publisher= Oreilly |page= xxiii |isbn= |date=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the original Mac team would include [[Bill Atkinson]], Bob Belleville, [[Steve Capps]], [[George Crow]], Donn Denman, [[Chris Espinosa]], [[Andy Hertzfeld]], [[Bruce Horn]], [[Susan Kare]], Larry Kenyon, and Caroline Rose with [[Steve Jobs]] leading the project.&lt;ref name=hertz1&gt;{{cite book |last= Hertzfeld |first=Andy |title= Revolution in the Valley: The Insanely Great Story of How the Mac was Made |url= |location= |publisher= Oreilly |page= xxi-xxiv |isbn= |date=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 interview, [[Steve Wozniak]] insinuated that he had been leading the initial design and development phase of the Macintosh project until 1981 when he experienced a traumatic airplane crash and temporarily left the company, at which point Jobs took over. In that same interview, Wozniak said that the original Macintosh "failed" under Jobs and that it was not until Jobs left that it became a success. He attributed the eventual success of the Macintosh to people like [[John Sculley]] "who worked to build a Macintosh market when the Apple II went away".&lt;ref name=TheVerge&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Wozniak on Newton, Tesla, and why the original Macintosh was a 'lousy' product|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/27/4468314/steve-wozniak-on-how-the-newton-changed-his-life|accessdate=June 28, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312014832/http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/27/4468314/steve-wozniak-on-how-the-newton-changed-his-life|archivedate=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's first Macintosh board was built to Raskin's design specifications: it had 64&amp;nbsp;[[kilobytes]] (kB) of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], used the 8-bit [[Motorola 6809]]E microprocessor, and was capable of supporting a 256×256-[[pixel]] [[black and white|black-and-white]] [[Raster graphics|bitmap]] display. Bud Tribble, a member of the Mac team, was interested in running the [[Apple Lisa]]'s graphical programs on the Macintosh and asked Smith whether he could incorporate Lisa's 68000 microprocessor into the Mac while still keeping the production cost down. By December 1980, Smith had succeeded in designing a board that not only used the 68000 but increased its speed from Lisa's 5&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]] to 8&amp;nbsp;MHz; this board also had the capacity to support a 384×256-pixel display. Smith's design used fewer RAM chips than the Lisa, which made the production of the board significantly more cost-efficient. The final Mac design was self-contained and had the complete [[QuickDraw]] picture language and interpreter in 64&amp;nbsp;KB of [[read-only memory|ROM]]&amp;nbsp;– far more than most other computers which typically had around 4 to 8&amp;nbsp;KB of ROM; it had 128&amp;nbsp;kB of RAM, in the form of sixteen 64-[[kilobit]] (kb) RAM chips [[solder]]ed to the [[motherboard|logicboard]]. Although there were no memory slots, its RAM was expandable to 512&amp;nbsp;kB by means of soldering sixteen [[Integrated circuit|IC]] sockets to accept 256&amp;nbsp;kb RAM chips in place of the factory-installed chips. The final product's screen was a {{convert|9|in |adj=on}}, 512x342 pixel [[monochrome]] display, exceeding the size of the planned screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Hertzfeld |first=Andy |publisher= Folklore.org |authorlink=Andy Hertzfeld |url= http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Five_Different_Macs.txt |title=Five different Macintoshes |accessdate= April 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This sources the entire paragraph.--&gt;

Burrell's innovative design, combining the low production cost of an [[Apple II]] with the computing power of Lisa's Motorola 68000 CPU, began to receive Jobs's attentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hertzfeld |first=Andy |url= http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Square_Dots.txt&amp;topic=Hardware%20Design&amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date |publisher= Folklore.org |title=Square Dots |accessdate= July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[InfoWorld]]'' in September 1981 reported on the existence of the secret Lisa and "McIntosh" projects at Apple. Stating that they and another computer "are all scheduled to be ready for release within a year", it described McIntosh as a portable computer with the 68000 and 128KB memory, and possibly battery-powered.&lt;ref name="freiberger19810914"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mj0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=Apple Develops New Computers |last=Freiberger |first=Paul |date=1981-09-14 |work=InfoWorld |access-date=2019-04-08 |pages=1, 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that the Macintosh was more marketable than the Lisa, Jobs began to focus his attention on the project. Raskin left the team in 1981 over a personality conflict with Jobs. After development had completed, team member Andy Hertzfeld said that the final Macintosh design is closer to Jobs's ideas than Raskin's.&lt;ref name="Father of Mac" /&gt; When Jobs was forced out of the Lisa team in 1982, he devoted his entire attention to the Macintosh.

Two days after "1984" aired, the Macintosh went on sale, and came bundled with two applications designed to show off its interface: [[MacWrite]] and [[MacPaint]]. It was first demonstrated by Steve Jobs in the first of his famous Mac keynote speeches, and though the Mac garnered an immediate, enthusiastic following, some labeled it a mere "toy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2004/01/61730 |title=We're All Mac Users Now |accessdate=April 11, 2010 |last=Kahney |first=Leander |date=January 6, 2004 |magazine=[[Wired News|Wired]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104172110/http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2004/01/61730 |archivedate=January 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the operating system was designed largely around the GUI, existing text-mode and [[command line interface|command-driven applications]] had to be redesigned and the programming code rewritten. This was a time-consuming task that many [[software developer]]s chose not to undertake, and could be regarded as a reason for an initial lack of software for the new system. In April 1984, [[Microsoft]]'s [[MultiPlan]] migrated over from [[MS-DOS]], with [[Microsoft Word]] following in January 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/applehis/appl1984.htm |title=Chronology of Apple Computer Personal Computers |author=Polsson, Ken |accessdate=November 18, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821105822/http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/applehis/appl1984.htm |archivedate=August 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 [[Lotus Software]] introduced [[Lotus Jazz]] for the Macintosh platform after the success of [[Lotus 1-2-3]] for the [[IBM PC]], although it was largely a flop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-11721498/lotus-third-time-charm.html|title=For Lotus, third time's the charm|author=Beamer, Scott|accessdate=June 23, 2010|date=January 13, 1992|magazine=MacWEEK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple introduced the [[Macintosh Office]] suite the same year with the [[Lemmings (television commercial)|"Lemmings" ad]]. Infamous for insulting its own potential customers, the ad was not successful.&lt;ref name="Worst Business" /&gt;

Apple spent $2.5 million purchasing all 39 advertising pages in a special, post-election issue of ''[[Newsweek]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guidebookgallery.org/ads/magazines/macos/macos10-newsweek|title=1984 ''Newsweek'' Macintosh ads|publisher=GUIdebook, [[Newsweek]]|accessdate=April 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ran a "Test Drive a Macintosh" promotion, in which potential buyers with a credit card could take home a Macintosh for 24 hours and return it to a dealer afterwards. While 200,000 people participated, dealers disliked the promotion, the supply of computers was insufficient for demand, and many were returned in such a bad condition that they could no longer be sold. This marketing campaign caused CEO John Sculley to raise the price from [[United States dollar|$]]1,995 to $2,495 ({{inflation|US|2495|1985|r=-2|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref name=unvlmcin/&gt;&lt;ref name="Worst Business"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/16036/Apples-Worst-Business-Decisions/|title=Apple's Worst Business Decisions|author=Hormby, Thomas|publisher=OS News|accessdate=December 24, 2007|date=October 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The computer sold well, nonetheless, reportedly outselling the [[IBM PCjr]] which also began shipping early that year; one dealer reported a backlog of more than 600 orders.&lt;ref name=richter19840328&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.newspapers.com/clip/31276226/the_cincinnati_enquirer/ |title=Macintosh Takes Lead In Sales Race |last=Richter |first=Paul |date=1984-03-28 |work=The Cincinnati Enquirer |access-date=2019-05-05 |agency=[[Los Angeles Times]] |pages=B-1, B-2 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time19840402"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,954205-2,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609012541/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C954205%2C00.html |archivedate=June 9, 2008 |title=The Peanut Meets the Mac |accessdate=2011-02-23 |author1=McCarroll, Thomas |author2=Michael Moritz |author3=Philip Elmer-DeWitt |date=1984-04-02 |work=Time |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 1984 the company sold 50,000 Macintoshes, and hoped for 70,000 by early May and almost 250,000 by the end of the year.&lt;ref name="hayes19840424"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/24/business/apple-is-banking-on-new-portable-the-iic-computer.html | title=Apple is Banking on New Portable: The IIc Computer | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=1984-04-24 | accessdate=5 January 2015 | author=Hayes, Thomas C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1984–90: Desktop publishing ===
Most Apple II sales had once been to companies, but the IBM PC caused small businesses, schools, and some homes to become Apple's main customers.&lt;ref name="maceiie19840409"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jC4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;pg=PA54#v=onepage | title=Apple IIe Sales Surge as IIc is Readied | work=InfoWorld | date=1984-04-09 | accessdate=4 February 2015 | author=Mace, Scott | pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs stated during the Macintosh's introduction "we expect Macintosh to become the third industry standard", after the Apple II and IBM PC. Although outselling every other computer, and so compelling that one dealer described it as "the first $2,500 [[impulse purchase|impulse item]]", Macintosh did not meet expectations during the first year, especially among business customers. Only about ten applications including MacWrite and MacPaint were widely available,{{r|richter19840328}}&lt;ref name="bartimo19850225"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6C4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage | title=Macintosh: Success And Disappointment | work=InfoWorld | date=1985-02-25 | accessdate=27 January 2015 | author=Bartimo, Jim | pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; although many non-Apple software developers participated in the introduction and Apple promised that 79 companies including Lotus, [[Digital Research]], and [[Ashton-Tate]] were creating products for the new computer. After one year for each computer, the Macintosh had less than one-quarter of the PC's software selection—including one word processor, two databases, and one spreadsheet—although Apple had sold 280,000 Macintoshes compared to IBM's first-year sales of fewer than 100,000 PCs.{{r|infoworld19850114}} MacWrite's inclusion with the Macintosh discouraged developers from creating other word processing software.&lt;ref name="mcneill198712"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/COMPUTEs_Apple_Applications_Vol._5_No._2_Issue_6_1987-12_COMPUTE_Publications_US#page/n55/mode/2up | title=Macintosh: The Word Explosion | work=Compute!'s Apple Applications | date=December 1987 | accessdate=14 September 2016 | author=McNeill, Dan | pages=54–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Macintosh excited software developers,{{r|richter19840328}} they were required to learn how to write software that used the graphic user interface,&lt;ref name="infoworld19850114"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-i4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage | title=Macintosh Vs.

The Macintosh 128K, originally released as the Apple Macintosh, is the original Apple Macintosh personal computer. Its beige case consisted of a 9 in (23&amp;nbsp;cm) CRT monitor and came with a keyboard and mouse. A handle built into the top of the case made it easier for the computer to be lifted and carried. This was synonymous with the release of the iconic 1984 TV Advertisement by Apple. This model and the 512k released in September of the same year had signatures of the core team embossed inside the hard plastic cover and soon became collector pieces.

In 1985 the combination of the Mac, Apple's [[LaserWriter]] printer, and Mac-specific software like Boston Software's [[MacPublisher]] and [[Adobe PageMaker|Aldus PageMaker]] enabled users to design, preview, and print page layouts complete with text and graphics—an activity to become known as [[desktop publishing]]. Initially, desktop publishing was unique to the Macintosh, but eventually became available for other platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Spring | first = Michael B. | title = Electronic printing and publishing: the document processing revolution | publisher=CRC Press | year = 1991 | pages = 125–126 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=_MV46vFUrI4C&amp;pg=PA125 | isbn = 978-0-8247-8544-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, applications such as Macromedia FreeHand, [[QuarkXPress]], and [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]'s [[Photoshop]] and [[Adobe Illustrator|Illustrator]] strengthened the Mac's position as a graphics computer and helped to expand the emerging desktop publishing market.

[[File:Apple-Macintosh.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A Macintosh sits in a museum exhibit about postmodernism.|The Apple [[Macintosh Plus]] at the [[Röhsska Museum|Design Museum]] in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden]]
The Macintosh's minimal memory became apparent, even compared with other personal computers in 1984, and could not be expanded easily. It also lacked a [[hard disk drive]] or the means to easily attach one. Many small companies sprang up to address the memory issue. Suggestions revolved around either upgrading the memory to 512&amp;nbsp;KB or removing the computer's 16 memory chips and replacing them with larger-capacity chips, a tedious and difficult operation. In October 1984 Apple introduced the [[Macintosh 512K]], with quadruple the memory of the original, at a price of US$3,195.&lt;ref name="512_specs"&gt;{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh 512K]]|appleNumber=SP187|everyURL=mac_classic/stats/mac_512k.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also offered an upgrade for 128k Macs that involved replacing the logic board.

Apple released the [[Macintosh Plus]] on January 10, 1986, for a price of US$2,600. It offered one [[megabyte]] of RAM, easily expandable to four megabytes by the use of [[SIMM|socketed RAM boards]]. It also featured a [[SCSI]] parallel interface, allowing up to seven peripherals—such as hard drives and scanners—to be attached to the machine. Its [[Macintosh External Disk Drive|floppy drive]] was increased to an 800&amp;nbsp;[[Kilobyte|kB]] capacity. The Mac Plus was an immediate success and remained in production, unchanged, until October 15, 1990; on sale for just over four years and ten months, it was the longest-lived Macintosh in Apple's history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh Plus]]|appleNumber=SP190|everyURL=mac_classic/stats/mac_plus.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the 2nd generation [[Mac Pro]] that was introduced on December 19, 2013 surpassed this record on September 18, 2018. In September 1986 Apple introduced the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop, or [[Macintosh Programmer's Workshop|MPW]], an application that allowed software developers to create software for Macintosh on Macintosh, rather than [[cross compiling]] from a Lisa. In August 1987, Apple unveiled [[HyperCard]] and [[MultiFinder]], which added cooperative multitasking to the operating system. Apple began bundling both with every Macintosh.

[[File:MacII.jpg|thumb|alt=A Macintosh II with a separate monitor and CPU|The [[Macintosh II]], the first Macintosh model with color graphics]]
Updated Motorola CPUs made a faster machine possible, and in 1987 Apple took advantage of the new Motorola technology and introduced the [[Macintosh II]] at $5500, powered by a {{nowrap|16&amp;nbsp;MHz}} [[Motorola 68020]] processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh II]]|appleNumber=SP193|everyURL=mac_ii/stats/mac_ii.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary improvement in the Macintosh II was Color [[QuickDraw]] in ROM, a color version of the graphics language which was the heart of the machine. Among the many innovations in Color QuickDraw were the ability to handle any display size, any color depth, and multiple monitors. The Macintosh II marked the start of a new direction for the Macintosh, as now for the first time it had an [[open architecture]] with several [[NuBus]] expansion slots, support for color graphics and external monitors, and a modular design similar to that of the IBM PC. It had an internal hard drive and a power supply with a fan, which was initially fairly loud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=160|title=Apple Macintosh II|accessdate=December 23, 2007|publisher=Old Computers On-line Museum|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124020103/http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=160|archive-date=November 24, 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; One third-party developer sold a device to regulate fan speed based on a heat sensor, but it voided the warranty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/TA40560 |title=Macintosh II Family: Fan Regulator Voids Warranty|accessdate=December 23, 2007|publisher=Apple|date=July 2, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Macintosh computers had quieter power supplies and hard drives.

[[File:Macintosh SE b.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A Macintosh II SE|The [[Macintosh SE]], updated [[Compact Macintosh]] design using [[Snow White design language]]]]
The [[Macintosh SE]] was released at the same time as the Macintosh II for $2900 (or $3900 with hard drive), as the first [[Compact Macintosh|compact Mac]] with a 20&amp;nbsp;MB internal hard drive and an expansion slot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh SE]]|appleNumber=SP191|everyURL=mac_classic/stats/mac_se.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SE's expansion slot was located inside the case along with the CRT, potentially exposing an upgrader to high voltage. For this reason, Apple recommended users bring their SE to an authorized Apple dealer to have upgrades performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple Service Source: Apple SE/30|accessdate=November 16, 2010|url=http://www.apple-collection.com/CarPos/macse30.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SE also updated [[Jerry Manock]] and Terry Oyama's original design and shared the Macintosh II's ''[[Snow White design language|Snow White]]'' design language, as well as the new [[Apple Desktop Bus]] (ADB) [[Apple Mouse#Apple Desktop Bus Mouse (G5431/A9M0331)|mouse]] and [[Apple Keyboard#Apple Keyboard (M0116)|keyboard]] that had first appeared on the [[Apple IIGS|Apple II&lt;small&gt;GS&lt;/small&gt;]] some months earlier.

In 1987 Apple spun off its software business as [[Claris]]. It was given the code and rights to several applications, most notably MacWrite, MacPaint, and [[MacProject]]. In the late 1980s, Claris released a number of revamped software titles; the result was the "Pro" series, including MacDraw Pro, MacWrite Pro, and FileMaker Pro. To provide a complete office suite, Claris purchased the rights to the [[Informix Wingz]] [[spreadsheet]] program on the Mac, renaming it [[Claris Resolve]], and added the new presentation software [[Claris Impact]]. By the early 1990s, Claris applications were shipping with the majority of consumer-level Macintoshes and were extremely popular. In 1991 Claris released [[AppleWorks|ClarisWorks]], which soon became their second best-selling application. When Claris was reincorporated back into Apple in 1998, ClarisWorks was renamed AppleWorks beginning with version 5.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=MIT Project on Mathematics and Computation|url=http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~bob/clarisworks.php|title=A Brief History of ClarisWorks|accessdate=December 24, 2007|year=2003|author=Hearm, Bob|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224153145/http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~bob/clarisworks.php|archive-date=December 24, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Apple [[Apple Computer, Inc. v.

After four years, the case was decided against Apple, as were later [[United States court of appeals|appeals]]. Apple's actions were criticized by some in the software community, including the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF), who felt Apple was trying to monopolize on GUIs in general, and boycotted GNU software for the Macintosh platform for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Free Software Foundation]]|title=Special Report: Apple's New Look and Feel|url=https://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull5.html#SEC9|journal=GNU's Bulletin|volume=1|issue=5|date= June 11, 1988 |accessdate=April 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Free Software Foundation]]|title=End of Apple Boycott|url=https://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull18.html#SEC13|journal=GNU's Bulletin|volume=1|issue=18|date=January 1995|accessdate=April 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the new [[Motorola 68030]] processor came the [[Macintosh IIx]] in 1988, which had benefited from internal improvements, including an on-board [[memory management unit|MMU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh IIx]]|appleNumber=SP194|everyURL=mac_ii/stats/mac_iix.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed in 1989 by  the [[Macintosh IIcx]], a more compact version with fewer slots &lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh IIcx]]|everyURL=apple/mac_ii/stats/mac_iicx.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a version of the Mac SE powered by the {{nowrap|16&amp;nbsp;MHz}} 68030, the [[Macintosh SE/30]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh SE/30]]|appleNumber=SP195|everyURL=mac_classic/stats/mac_se30.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the [[Macintosh IIci]], running at {{nowrap|25&amp;nbsp;MHz}}, was the first Mac to be "[[32-bit clean]]."

Apart from its fast {{nowrap|40&amp;nbsp;MHz}} [[Motorola 68030|68030]] processor, it had significant internal architectural improvements, including faster memory and two Apple II CPUs ([[MOS Technology 6502|6502s]]) dedicated to [[Input/output|I/O]] processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh IIfx]]|appleNumber=SP203|everyURL=mac_ii/stats/mac_iifx.html|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1990–98: Decline and transition to PowerPC ===
[[Windows 3.0|Microsoft Windows 3.0]] was released in May 1990, and according to a common saying at the time "Windows was not as good as Macintosh, but it was good enough for the average user". Although still a graphical wrapper that relied upon MS-DOS, 3.0 was the first iteration of Windows which had a feature set and performance comparable to the much more expensive Macintosh platform. It also did not help matters that during the previous year [[Jean-Louis Gassée]] had steadfastly refused to lower the profit margins on Mac computers. Finally, there was a component shortage that rocked the exponentially-expanding PC industry in 1989, forcing Apple USA head Allan Loren to cut prices, which dropped Apple's margins.&lt;ref name=lowend_2013_0817 /&gt;

[[File:Lcii-system.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Macintosh LC II]] with a Macintosh 12" RGB Display.]]
In response, Apple introduced a range of relatively inexpensive Macs in October 1990. The [[Macintosh Classic]], essentially a less expensive version of the Macintosh SE, was the least expensive Mac offered until early 2001.&lt;ref name="lesscostlyMacClassic"&gt;{{cite news|title=Less-Costly Apple Line To Be Presented Today|first=Lawrence M.|last=Fisher |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFD9163CF936A25753C1A966958260|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 15, 1990|accessdate=January 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 68020-powered [[Macintosh LC]], in its distinctive "[[Pizza box form factor|pizza box]]" case, offered color graphics and was accompanied by a new, low-cost 512×384 pixel monitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh LC]]|appleNumber=SP205|everyURL=mac_lc/stats/mac_lc.html|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Macintosh IIsi]] was essentially a {{nowrap|20&amp;nbsp;MHz}} IIci with only one expansion slot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=[[Macintosh IIsi]]|appleNumber=SP199|everyURL=mac_ii/stats/mac_iisi.html|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Powerbook 100 pose.jpg|thumb|The [[PowerBook 100]]]]
Apple released their first portable computer, the [[Macintosh Portable]] in 1989. Although due to considerable design issues, it was soon replaced in 1991 with the first of the [[PowerBook]] line: the [[PowerBook 100]], a miniaturized portable; the {{nowrap|16&amp;nbsp;MHz}} 68030 [[PowerBook 140]]; and the {{nowrap|25&amp;nbsp;MHz}} 68030 [[PowerBook 170]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/applehis/appl1990.htm |title=Chronology of Apple Computer Personal Computers |author=Polsson, Ken |accessdate=November 18, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212193823/http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/applehis/appl1990.htm |archivedate=December 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the first portable computers with the keyboard behind a palm rest and a built-in pointing device (a [[trackball]]) in front of the keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/02/16/apple_to_re_enter_the_sub_notebook_market.html|title=Apple to re-enter the sub-notebook market|author=Jade, Kasper|publisher=AppleInsider|accessdate=December 24, 2007|date=February 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1993 [[PowerBook 165c]] was Apple's first portable computer to feature a color screen, displaying 256 colors with {{nowrap|640 × 400}}-pixel resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=PowerBook 165c|appleNumber=SP148|everyURL=powerbook/stats/mac_powerbook165c.html|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second generation of PowerBooks, the 68040-equipped [[PowerBook 500 series|500 series]], introduced [[trackpad]]s, integrated stereo speakers, and built-in [[Ethernet]] to the laptop form factor in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=PowerBook 520|appleNumber=SP160|everyURL=powerbook/stats/mac_powerbook520.html|accessdate=November 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for Mac OS, [[System 7 (Macintosh)|System 7]] introduced a form of [[virtual memory]], improved the performance of color graphics, and gained standard [[co-operative multitasking]]. Also during this time, the Macintosh began to shed the [[Snow White design language|"Snow White" design language]], along with the expensive consulting fees they were paying to [[Frogdesign]]. Apple instead brought the design work in-house by establishing the [[Apple Industrial Design Group]], becoming responsible for crafting a new look for all Apple products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kunkel|first=Paul|others=Rick English (photographs)|title=AppleDesign: The work of the Apple Industrial Design Group|url=https://archive.org/details/DTCA3DOC-230_industrial_design|date= October 1, 1997 |publisher=[[Graphis Inc.]]|location=New York City|isbn=1-888001-25-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intel had tried unsuccessfully to push Apple to migrate the Macintosh platform to Intel chips. Apple concluded that Intel's CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) architecture ultimately would not be able to compete against RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=7045 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-14 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208100556/http://macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=7045 |archivedate=December 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Motorola 68040]]  offered the same features as the [[Intel 80486]] and could on a clock-for-clock basis significantly outperform the Intel chip, the 486 had the ability to be clocked significantly faster without suffering from overheating problems, especially the clock-doubled i486DX2 which ran the CPU logic at twice the external bus speed, giving such equipped IBM compatible systems a significant performance lead over their Macintosh equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= CISC: The Intel 80486 vs. The Motorola MC68040 |url= http://textfiles.meulie.net/computers/486vs040.txt |accessdate= May 20, 2013 |date= July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/68040/ |title=68040 Microprocessor |accessdate=October 2, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517121248/http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/68040/ |archivedate=May 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple's product design and engineering did not help matters as they restricted the use of the '040 to their expensive Quadras for a time while the 486 was readily available to OEMs as well as enthusiasts who put together their own machines. In late 1991, as the higher-end Macintosh desktop lineup transitioned to the '040, Apple was unable to offer the '040 in their top-of-the-line PowerBooks until early 1994 with the [[PowerBook 500 series]], several years after the first 486-powered IBM compatible laptops hit the market which cost Apple considerable sales. In 1993 Intel rolled out the [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] processors as the successor to the 486, while the Motorola 68050 was never released, leaving the Macintosh platform a generation behind IBM compatibles in the latest CPU technology. In 1994 Apple abandoned Motorola CPUs for the [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] PowerPC architecture developed by the [[AIM alliance]] of Apple Computer, IBM, and Motorola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaomso.com/FullStory.php?TheStory=78 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050221094423/http://www.kaomso.com/FullStory.php?TheStory=78 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 21, 2005 |title=Apple's Transition to PowerPC put in perspective |author=Hormby, Thomas |publisher=Kaomso |accessdate=December 24, 2007 |date=January 3, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Power Macintosh]] line, the first to use the new chips, proved to be highly successful, with over a million PowerPC units sold in nine months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/applehis/appl1994.htm |title=Chronology of Apple Computer Personal Computers |author=Polsson, Ken |accessdate=December 24, 2007 |date=December 16, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212193828/http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/applehis/appl1994.htm |archivedate=December 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the long run, spurning Intel for the PowerPC was a mistake as the commoditization of Intel-architecture chips meant Apple could not compete on price against "the Dells of the world".&lt;ref name="web.archive.org" /&gt;

Notwithstanding these technical and commercial successes on the Macintosh, the falling costs of components made IBM PC compatibles cheaper and accelerated their adoption, over Macintosh systems that remained fairly expensive. A successful price war initiated by [[Compaq]] vaulted them from third place to first among PC manufacturers in 1994, overtaking a struggling IBM and relegating Apple to third place.&lt;ref name="Money.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1996/04/01/210990/index.htm |title=FAST TIMES AT COMPAQ WITH ECKHARD PFEIFFER AT THE WHEEL, COMPAQ IS PASSING OTHER PC MAKERS.

Furthermore, Apple had created too many similar models that confused potential buyers. At one point, its product lineup was subdivided into Classic, LC, II, Quadra, [[Macintosh Performa|Performa]], and [[Macintosh Centris|Centris]] models, with essentially the same computer being sold under a number of different names.&lt;ref name="Apple Computer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=12707|title=Macintosh Centris, Quadra 660AV: Description (Discontinued)|author=Apple Computer|accessdate=December 24, 2007|date=June 19, 1995|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707153455/http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=12707|archive-date=July 7, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These models competed against [[Macintosh clone]]s, hardware manufactured by third parties to whom Apple had licensed [[System 7]]. This succeeded in increasing the Macintosh's market share somewhat and provided cheaper hardware for consumers, but hurt Apple financially as existing Apple customers began to buy cheaper clones which cannibalized the sales of Apple's higher-margin Macintosh systems, while Apple continued to bear the burden of developing [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]].

Apple's [[market share]] further struggled due to the release of the [[Windows 95]] operating system, which unified Microsoft's formerly separate MS-DOS and Windows products. Windows 95 significantly enhanced the multimedia capability and performance of [[IBM PC compatible]] computers and brought the capabilities of Windows substantially nearer to parity with Mac OS.

When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 following the company's purchase of NeXT, he ordered that the OS that had been previewed as System 7.7 be branded [[Mac OS 8]], a name Apple had previously wished to preserve for the never-to-appear next generation [[Copland (operating system)|Copland OS]]. This maneuver effectively ended the clone lines, as Apple had only licensed System 7 to clone manufacturers, not Mac OS 8. The decision caused significant financial losses for companies like [[Motorola]], who produced the [[Motorola StarMax|StarMax]]; Umax, who produced the SuperMac;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everymac.com/systems/umax/index-umax-supermac-mac-clones.html|title=Umax Mac Clones (MacOS-Compatible Systems)|author=EveryMac.com|accessdate=November 11, 2009|date=October 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Power Computing Corporation|Power Computing]], who offered several lines of Mac clones, including the PowerWave, PowerTower, and PowerTower Pro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everymac.com/systems/powercc/index-power-computing-mac-clones.html|title=PowerComputing Mac Clones (MacOS-Compatible Systems)|author=EveryMac.com|accessdate=November 11, 2009|date=October 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These companies had invested substantial resources in creating their own Mac-compatible hardware.&lt;ref name=lowend_2007_0830 /&gt;
Apple bought out Power Computing's license but allowed Umax to continue selling Mac clones until their license expired, as they had a sizeable presence in the lower-end segment that Apple did not. In September 1997 Apple extended Umax's license allowing them to sell clones with Mac OS 8, the only clone maker to do so, but with the restriction that they only sell low-end systems. Without the higher profit margins of high-end systems, however, Umax judged this would not be profitable and exited the Mac clone market in May 1998, having lost US$36 million on the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXnw5tM8QRwC&amp;pg=PA256&amp;lpg=PA256|title=Apple Confidential}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lowendmac.com/2014/apple-squeezes-mac-clones-out-of-the-market/|title=Apple Squeezed Mac Clones out of the Market|quote=Umax stretched out its license as long as possible, and Apple even offered Umax the chance to continue in the sub-$1,000 market, but without the more profitable high-end models, the SuperMac division would not be viable. Even though Umax was the lone cloner to acquire a Mac OS 8 license and actually shipped some computers with OS 8, it was too little, too late. On May 27, 1998, Umax threw in the towel, the last of the Mac clone makers to fall. A handful of staffers kept SuperMac support running until late December.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://windowsitpro.com/windows-server/umax-gets-new-mac-license-motorola-drops-new-box|title=Umax gets new mac license|quote=One of the two remaining Macintosh clone makers, Umax Data Systems, has announced that it has secured a new licensing agreement with Apple Computer that allows it to offer MacOS 8.0 with its systems.

=== 1998–2005: Revival ===
[[File:IMac Bondi Blue.jpg|thumb|The [[iMac G3]], introduced in 1998. While it led Apple's return to profitability, its [[Apple USB Mouse|associated mouse]] was one of consumers' least favorite products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Engst|first=Adam|title=The six worst Apple products of all time|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/138404/2009/01/macat25_worstproducts.html|magazine=[[Macworld]]|accessdate=May 14, 2010|date=January 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1998 Apple introduced its new [[iMac]] which, like the original 128K Mac, was an all-in-one computer. Its translucent plastic case, originally [[Bondi blue]] and later various additional colors, is considered an [[industrial design]] landmark of the late 1990s. The iMac did away with most of Apple's standard (and usually proprietary) connections, such as [[SCSI]] and [[Apple Desktop Bus|ADB]], in favor of two [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spooner|first=John|title=Compaq hopes to follow iMac|url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/compaq-hopes-to-follow-the-imac/104658|work=ZDNet|accessdate=May 10, 2012|date=January 23, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It replaced a [[floppy disk]] drive with a [[CD-ROM]] drive for installing software,&lt;ref name="eight ways"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Edwards|first=Benj|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/135017/2008/08/imacanniversary.html|title=Eight ways the iMac changed computing|magazine=[[Macworld]]|date=August 15, 2008|accessdate=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mac|model=[[iMac G3]]|appleNumber=SP136|everyURL=imac/stats/imac_ab.html|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was incapable of writing to CDs or other media without external third-party hardware.

The iMac also marked Apple's transition from the "Macintosh" name to the more simplistic "Mac". Apple completed the elimination of the Macintosh product name in 1999 when "Power Macintosh" was retired with the introduction of the [[Power Mac G4]].

In early 2001 Apple began shipping computers with [[CD-RW]] drives and emphasized the Mac's ability to play DVDs by including [[DVD-ROM]] and [[DVD-RAM]] drives as standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pcworld.about.com/news/Jan092001id37951.htm |title=Speed, Song Highlight Apple Product Announcements |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029065952/http://pcworld.about.com/news/Jan092001id37951.htm |archivedate=October 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Jobs admitted that Apple had been "late to the party" on writable CD technology, but felt that Macs could become a "digital hub" that linked and enabled an "emerging digital lifestyle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Apple-picks-up-the-beat-with-CD-RW-drives/2100-1040_3-249578.html|title=Apple picks up the beat with CD-RW drives}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple would later introduce an update to its [[iTunes]] music player software that enabled it to burn CDs, along with a controversial "Rip, Mix, Burn" advertising campaign that some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/3744/2002/03/eisner2.html|title=Disney boss accuses Apple of fostering piracy|date=March 1, 2002|work=[[Macworld]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; felt encouraged [[media piracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maclife.com/article/feature/complete_itunes_history_soundjam_mp_itunes_9|title=The Complete iTunes History – SoundJam MP to iTunes 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accompanied the release of the [[iPod]], Apple's first successful [[Mobile device|handheld device]].

The [[iMac G3|original iMac]] used a [[PowerPC G3]] processor, but [[iMac G4|G4]] and [[iMac G5|G5]] chips were soon added, both accompanied by complete case redesigns that dropped the array of colors in favor of white plastic. As of 2007, all iMacs use aluminum cases. On January 11, 2005, Apple announced the [[Mac Mini]], priced at US$499, making it the cheapest Mac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apple Changes Course With Low-Priced Mac|first1=John|last1=Markoff|first2=Saul|last2=Hansell| authorlink = John Markoff | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/12/technology/12apple.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 12, 2005|accessdate=January 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCunveil&gt;{{cite news|title=Apple unveils low-cost 'Mac mini'|work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4162009.stm|accessdate=April 28, 2010 | date=January 11, 2005|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mac OS continued to evolve up to version 9.2.2, including retrofits such as the addition of a [[nanokernel]] and support for [[Multi-core (computing)|Multiprocessing Services]] 2.0 in [[Mac OS 8.6]], though its dated architecture made replacement necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/PPCSoftware/PPCSoftware-12.html#HEADING12-0|title=Apple Developer Connection&amp;nbsp;– Overview of the PowerPC System Software|publisher=Apple|accessdate=May 11, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706114009/http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/PPCSoftware/PPCSoftware-12.html#HEADING12-0|archivedate=July 6, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its beginnings on an 8&amp;nbsp;MHz machine with 128&amp;nbsp;KB of RAM, it had grown to support Apple's latest 1&amp;nbsp;GHz G4-equipped Macs. Since its architecture was first established, the lack of base features that were already common on Apple's competition, like [[preemptive multitasking]] and [[protected memory]], reached a critical mass. As such, Apple introduced [[OS X|Mac OS X]], a fully overhauled [[Unix]]-based successor to [[Mac OS 9]]. OS X uses [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]], [[XNU]], and [[Mach kernel|Mach]] as [[Architecture of OS X|foundations]], and is based on [[NeXTSTEP]]. It was released to the public in September 2000 as the [[Mac OS X Public Beta]], featuring a revamped [[user interface]] called "[[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]]". At US$29.99, it allowed adventurous Mac users to sample Apple's new operating system and provide feedback for the actual release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apple Breaks The Mold|first=J.D.|last=Biersdorfer|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E2DD1538F937A2575AC0A9669C8B63 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 14, 2000|accessdate=January 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial version of Mac OS X, [[Mac OS X v10.0|10.0]] "Cheetah", was released on March 24, 2001. Older Mac OS applications could still run under early Mac OS X versions, using an environment called "[[Classic Environment|Classic]]". Subsequent releases of Mac OS X included [[Mac OS X v10.1|10.1 "Puma"]] (2001), [[Mac OS X v10.2|10.2 "Jaguar"]] (2002), [[Mac OS X v10.3|10.3 "Panther"]] (2003) and [[Mac OS X v10.4|10.4 "Tiger"]] (2005).

=== 2005–present: Switch to Intel processors ===
Apple [[Apple–Intel transition|discontinued]] the use of [[PowerPC]] processors in 2006. At [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|WWDC]] 2005, Steve Jobs announced this transition, revealing that Mac OS X was always developed to run on both the Intel and PowerPC architectures.&lt;ref name="Intel transition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple to Use Intel Microprocessors Beginning in 2006 |url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html |publisher=Apple |accessdate=May 14, 2010 |date=June 6, 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722102013/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html |archivedate=July 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done in order to make the company's computer more modern, keeping pace with Intel's low power Pentium M chips, especially for heat-sensitive laptops.&lt;ref name="macworld.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/46961/2005/09/intelvsamd.html|title=Analysis: Why Apple picked Intel over AMD|publisher=|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PowerPC G5 chip's heavy power consumption and heat output (the Power Mac G5 had to be liquid-cooled) also prevented its use in Mac notebook computers (as well as the original [[Mac mini]]), which were forced to use the older and slower [[PowerPC G4]] chip. These shortcomings of the PowerPC chips were the main reasons behind Apple's transition to Intel processors, and the brand was revitalized by the subsequent boost in processing power available due to greater efficiency and the ability to implement multiple cores in Mac CPUs.

All new Macs now use [[x86 architecture|x86-64 processors]] made by [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], and some were renamed as a result.&lt;ref name="Macworld 10 significant"&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Apple's most significant products of the decade|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/145380/2010/01/10significantapplemoves.html|magazine=Macworld|last=Michaels|first=Philip|accessdate=May 14, 2010|date=January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intel-based Macs running OS X 10.6 and below (support has been discontinued since 10.7) can run pre-existing software developed for PowerPC using an [[emulator]] named [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=WWDC 2005 Keynote Live Update|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/45157/2005/06/liveupdate.html|magazine=Macworld|accessdate=May 14, 2010|date=June 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; although at noticeably slower speeds than native programs. However, the Classic environment is now unavailable on the Intel architecture. Intel chips introduced the potential to run the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]] natively on Apple hardware, without emulation software such as [[Microsoft Virtual PC|Virtual PC]]. In March 2006 a group of hackers announced that they were able to run [[Windows XP]] on an Intel-based Mac. The group released their software as open source and has posted it for download on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date= March 17, 2006 |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11885495|title=Hackers get Windows XP to run on a Mac|publisher=[[NBC News]] (AP)|accessdate=April 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 5, 2006, Apple announced the availability of the public beta of [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]], software that allows owners of Intel-based Macs to install Windows XP on their machines; later versions added support for [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]]. Classic was discontinued in Mac OS X 10.5, and Boot Camp became a standard feature on Intel-based Macs.&lt;ref name="apple bcamp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boot Camp|url=https://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/|publisher=Apple|accessdate=May 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Dalrymple|first=Jim|title=New Apple software lets Intel Macs boot Windows|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/50204/2006/04/bootcamp.html|magazine=Macworld|accessdate=May 14, 2010|date=March 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2006, Apple's [[industrial design]] shifted to favor aluminum, which was used in the construction of the first [[MacBook Pro]].  Glass was added in 2008 with the introduction of the [[unibody MacBook Pro]].

In April 2018 [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] reported that Apple intends to drop Intel chips and replace them with an "In-house" version, which caused Intel's shares to fall 6%. According to the report, the switch might happen as early as the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/03/apple-stop-using-intel-chips-processors-mac-computers&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple contracts hardware production to Asian [[original equipment manufacturer]]s such as [[Foxconn]] and [[Pegatron]], maintaining a high degree of control over the end product. By contrast, most other companies (including [[Microsoft]]) create software that can be run on hardware produced by a variety of [[Third-party developer|third parties]] such as [[Dell]], [[HP Inc.]]/[[Hewlett-Packard]]/[[Compaq]], and [[Lenovo]]. Consequently, the Macintosh buyer has comparably fewer options but has superior integration compared to a Microsoft buyer.

The current Mac product family uses [[Intel Corporation|Intel]] [[x86-64]] [[Central processing unit|processors]]. Apple introduced an emulator during the transition from [[PowerPC]] chips (called [[Rosetta (binary translation software)|Rosetta]]), much as it did during the transition from [[Motorola 68000]] architecture a decade earlier. The Macintosh is the only mainstream computer platform to have successfully transitioned to a new CPU architecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,933453,00.asp|title=Apple Switch | work=PC Magazine | first=John C.|last=Dvorak|date=March 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has done so twice. All current Mac models ship with at least 8&amp;nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]] of [[RAM]] as standard. Current Mac computers use [[Radeon|ATI/AMD Radeon]] or [[GeForce|Nvidia GeForce]] [[graphics card]]s as well as Intel graphics built into the main CPU. All current Macs do not ship with an optical media drive that includes a dual-function DVD/CD burner. Apple refers to this as a [[SuperDrive]]. Current Macs include two standard data transfer ports: [[USB 3.0|USB]] and [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] (except for the [[MacBook (Retina)|Retina MacBook]], which only has a USB-C port and headphone port). MacBook Pro, iMac, MacBook Air, and Mac Mini computers now also feature the "Thunderbolt" port, which Apple says can transfer data at speeds up to 10 gigabits per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Michaels|first=Phillip|title=New Mac minis add Thunderbolt, lose optical drive|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1161242/mac_mini.html|magazine=Macworld|accessdate=May 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  USB was introduced in the 1998 [[iMac G3]] and is ubiquitous today,&lt;ref name="eight ways" /&gt; while FireWire was mainly reserved for high-performance devices such as hard drives or video cameras.

== Software ==
{{Main|Macintosh operating systems}}
{{Further|Classic Mac OS|macOS}}
The original Macintosh was the first successful personal computer to use a [[graphical user interface]] devoid of a [[command line]]. It uses a [[desktop metaphor]], depicting real-world objects like [[computer file|documents]] and a [[trash (computing)|trash can]] as [[icon (computing)|icons]] on-screen. Now known as the [[classic Mac OS]], the [[Classic Mac OS|System]] software was introduced in 1984 with the first Macintosh, renamed [[System 7#Mac OS 7.6|Mac OS]] in 1997, and continued to evolve until version [[Mac OS 9|9.2.2]].

Originally, the hardware architecture was so closely tied to the [[classic Mac OS]] system that it was impossible to boot an alternative operating system. The most common workaround, is to boot into Mac OS and then to hand over control to a Mac OS-based [[bootloader]] application. Used even by Apple for [[A/UX]] and [[MkLinux]], this technique is no longer necessary since the introduction of [[Open Firmware]]-based [[Conventional PCI|PCI]] Macs, though it was formerly used for convenience on many [[Old World ROM]] systems due to bugs in the firmware implementation. Since then, Mac hardware boots directly from [[Open Firmware]] in most [[PowerPC]]-based Macs or [[Extensible Firmware Interface|EFI]] in all [[Intel-based Macs]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In 2001, Apple introduced [[macOS|Mac OS X]] (renamed [[macOS|OS X]] in 2012 and [[macOS]] in 2016), based on [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] and [[NeXTSTEP]]; its new features included the [[Dock (computing)|Dock]] and the [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]] user interface. During the transition, Apple included a [[virtual machine]] [[compatibility layer|subsystem]] known as [[Classic Environment|Classic]], allowing users to run [[Mac OS 9]] applications under [[Mac OS X 10.4]] and earlier on [[PowerPC]] machines. Because macOS is a [[Unix]] operating system that borrows heavily from [[FreeBSD]], many applications written for [[Linux kernel|Linux]]&lt;!--do not fix--&gt; or [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] run on it, often using [[X Window System|X11]]. There are many popular [[List of Macintosh software|Macintosh software applications]]; many of those from large developers, such as [[Microsoft Office]] and [[Adobe Photoshop]] are actively developed for both macOS and Windows. A large amount of [[open-source software]] applications, such as the [[Firefox]] [[web browser]] and the [[LibreOffice]] [[office suite]], are [[cross-platform]], and thereby also run natively on macOS.

Following the release of [[Intel-based Macs]], third-party [[platform virtualization]] software such as [[Parallels Desktop]], [[VMware Fusion]], and [[VirtualBox]] began to emerge. These programs allow users to run [[Microsoft Windows]] or previously Windows-only software on Macs at near native speed. Apple also released [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] and Mac-specific Windows [[Device driver|drivers]] that help users to install [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista|Vista]], [[Windows 7|7]], [[Windows 8|8]], [[Windows 8.1|8.1]] or [[Windows 10|10]] and natively [[dual boot]] between Mac OS X and Windows. Although not condoned by Apple, it is possible to run the [[Linux]] operating system using Boot camp or other virtualization [[workaround]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul J.

== Market share and user demographics ==

=== 1984–97: Success and decline ===
Since the introduction of the Macintosh, Apple has struggled to gain a significant [[market share|share]] of the personal computer market. At first, the Macintosh 128K suffered from a dearth of available software compared to [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM's PC]], resulting in disappointing sales in 1984 and 1985.

Notwithstanding these technical and commercial successes on the Macintosh platform, their systems remained fairly expensive, making them less competitive in light of the falling costs of components that made IBM PC compatibles cheaper and accelerated their adoption. In 1989, [[Jean-Louis Gassée]] had steadfastly refused to lower the profit margins on Mac computers, then there was a component shortage that rocked the exponentially-expanding PC industry that year, forcing Apple USA head Allan Loren to cut prices which dropped Apple's margins. [[Windows 3.0|Microsoft Windows 3.0]] was released in May 1990, the first iteration of Windows which had a feature set and performance comparable to the significantly costlier Macintosh.&lt;ref name=lowend_2013_0817 /&gt; Furthermore, Apple had created too many similar models that confused potential buyers; at one point the product lineup was subdivided into Classic, LC, II, Quadra, [[Macintosh Performa|Performa]], and [[Macintosh Centris|Centris]] models, with essentially the same computer being sold under a number of different names.&lt;ref name="Apple Computer" /&gt;

[[Compaq]], who had previously held the third-place spot among PC manufacturers during the 1980s and early/mid-1990s, initiated a successful price war in 1994 that vaulted them to the biggest by the year-end, overtaking a struggling IBM and relegating Apple to third place.&lt;ref name="Money.cnn.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt; Apple's [[market share]] further struggled due to the release of the [[Windows 95]] operating system, which unified Microsoft's formerly separate MS-DOS and Windows products. Windows 95 significantly enhanced the multimedia capability and performance of [[IBM PC compatible]] computers, and brought the capabilities of Windows to parity with the Mac OS [[GUI]].

=== 1997–2007: Comeback ===
In 1997, upon return to Apple as interim CEO, [[Steve Jobs]] terminated the Macintosh clone program while simplifying the computer product lines. If measuring market share by installed base, there were more than 20&amp;nbsp;million Mac users by 1997, compared to an installed base of around 340&amp;nbsp;million [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] PCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Apple Computer]] |date=December 19, 1997 |url=https://developer.apple.com/adcnews/pastissues/devnews121997.html#stats |title=Apple Developer News, No. 87 |accessdate=April 24, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905184109/http://developer.apple.com/adcnews/pastissues/devnews121997.html |archivedate=September 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Computer Industry Almanac Inc |date=November 3, 1998 |url=http://www.c-i-a.com/pr1198.htm |title=Nearly 600 Million Computers-in-Use in Year 2000 |accessdate=June 1, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617181908/http://c-i-a.com/pr1198.htm |archivedate=June 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the release of the [[iMac G3]] all-in-one was a great success, selling 800,000 units in 139 days, providing a much needed boost to the ailing Macintosh platform.&lt;ref name="Apple" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Markoff, John" /&gt; The introduction of the [[Power Macintosh G3 (Blue &amp; White)|Power Macintosh]] and [[iBook]] laptop completed "four-square product matrix" (''desktop'' and ''portable'' products for both ''consumers'' and ''professionals''), with the iBook ranking as the most popular laptop in the U.S. market for 1999.&lt;ref name="iBook: An iMac to Go" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Mac Observer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="apple.com" /&gt;

In 2000, Apple released the [[Power Mac G4 Cube]], their first desktop since the discontinued [[Power Mac G3#Outriggers|Power Macintosh G3]], to slot between the [[iMac G3]] and the [[Power Mac G4]]. Even with its innovative design, it was initially priced [[United States dollar|US$]]200 higher than the comparably-equipped and more-expandable base Power Mac G4, while also not including a monitor, making it too expensive and resulting in slow sales.&lt;ref name=ars&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/reviews/4q00/g4cube_cd/g4-cube-3.html |title=G4 Cube &amp; Cinema Display (review) |work=[[Ars Technica]] |first=John |last=Siracusa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple sold just 29,000 Cubes in Q4 of 2000 which was one third of expectations, compared to 308,000 Macs during that same quarter, and Cube sales dropped to 12,000 units in Q1 of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1153341/cube_10thanniversary.html|title=The Cube at 10: Why Apple's eye-catching desktop flopped|author=Benj Edwards|date=August 12, 2010|work=[[Macworld]]|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A price drop and hardware upgrades could not offset the earlier perception of the Cube's reduced value compared to the iMac and Power Mac G4 lineup, and it was discontinued in July 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2001/jul/03cube.html |title=Apple – Press Info – Apple Puts Power Mac G4 Cube on Ice |accessdate=October 2, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608033435/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2001/jul/03cube.html |archivedate=June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2002, Apple moved to eliminate CRT displays from its product line as part of aesthetic design and space-saving measures with the [[iMac G4]]. However, the new iMac with its flexible LCD flat-panel monitor was considerably more expensive on its debut than the preceding iMac G3, largely due to the higher cost of the LCD technology at the time. In order to keep the Macintosh affordable for the education market and due to obsolescence of the iMac G3, Apple created the [[eMac]] in April 2002 as the intended successor; however, the eMac's CRT made it relatively bulky and somewhat outdated, while its all-in-one construction meant it could not be expanded to meet consumer demand for larger monitors. The iMac G4's relatively high prices were approaching that of laptops which were portable and had higher resolution LCD screens. Meanwhile, Windows PC manufacturers could offer desktop configurations with LCD flat-panel monitors at prices comparable to the eMac and at a much lower cost than the iMac G4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://betanews.com/2002/11/11/review-gateway-profile-4-vs-apple-imac/|title=Review: Gateway Profile 4 vs. Apple iMac|work=BetaNews|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flop of the Power Mac G4 Cube, along with the more expensive iMac G4 and heavy eMac, meant that Macintosh desktop sales never reached the market share attained by the previous iMac G3. For the next half-decade while Macintosh sales held steady, it would instead be the [[iPod]] portable music player and [[iTunes]] music download service that would drive Apple's sales growth.

From 2001 to 2008, Mac sales increased continuously on an annual basis. Apple reported worldwide sales of 3.36&amp;nbsp;million Macs during the 2009 holiday season.&lt;ref name="2010_Q1_PR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/01/25results.html |title=Apple Reports First Quarter Results |publisher=Apple |date=January 25, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517214841/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/01/25results.html |archivedate=May 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of Mid-2011, the Macintosh continues to enjoy rapid market share increase in the US, growing from 7.3% of all computer shipments in 2010 to 9.3% in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loopinsight.com/2011/04/13/apples-mac-market-share-grows-18-9-in-first-quarter/ |title=Apple's Mac market share grows 18.9% in first quarter |publisher=Loopinsight.com |date=April 13, 2011 |accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to IDC's quarterly PC tracker, globally, in 3rd quarter of 2014, Apple's PC market share increased 5.7 percent year over year, with record sales of 5.5 million units.

Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gruber|first=John|authorlink=John Gruber|date=July 23, 2003|url=http://daringfireball.net/2003/07/market_share|title=Market Share|publisher=[[Daring Fireball]]|accessdate=April 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole.

Apple has generally dominated the premium PC market, having a 91 percent market share for PCs priced at more than $1,000 in 2009, according to [[NPD Group|NPD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/259141/why_ultrabook_sales_have_flopped_so_far.html|title=Why Ultrabook Sales Have Flopped So Far|author=Jared Newman|date=July 12, 2012|work=PCWorld|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Macintosh took 45 percent of operating profits in the PC industry during Q4 2012, compared to 13 percent for [[Dell Inc.|Dell]], seven percent for [[Hewlett Packard]], six percent for [[Lenovo]] and Asus, and one percent for Acer.&lt;ref name="zdnet.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2013/04/17/apple_macs_profits/|title=PC floggers scavenge for crumbs as Apple hoovers up profits.|publisher=|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While sales of the Macintosh have largely held steady, in comparison to Apple's sales of the iPhone and iPad which increased significantly during the 2010s, Macintosh computers still enjoy high margins on a per unit basis, with the majority being their MacBooks that are focused on the ultraportable niche that is the most profitable and only growing segment of PCs.&lt;ref name="zdnet.com" /&gt; It also helped that the Macintosh lineup is simple, updated on a yearly schedule, and consistent across both Apple retail stores, and authorized resellers where they have a special "store within a store" section to distinguish them from Windows PCs. In contrast, Windows PC manufacturers generally have a wide range of offerings, selling only a portion through retail with a full selection on the web, and often with limited-time or region-specific models. The Macintosh ranked third on the "list of intended brands for desktop purchases" for the 2011 holiday season, then moved up to second in 2012 by displacing Hewlett Packard, and in 2013 took the top spot ahead of Dell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-desktops-overtake-dell-on-shoppers-holiday-wish-lists/|title=Apple desktops overtake Dell on shoppers' holiday wish lists|work=CNET|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
