'''''Spain in Our Hearts: Americans in the Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book by [[Adam Hochschild]] that was first published by [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] on March 29, 2016.&lt;ref name=kirkusreview/&gt;&lt;ref name=pw1/&gt; The book is an account of the American volunteers who participated in the [[Spanish Civil War]] from 1936 to 1939. The story centers around several American volunteer fighters and journalists, tracing their motivations for joining the war and their experiences during the war which left many disillusioned. The book explains the involvement of foreign leaders including [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Joseph Stalin]], and explains why the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican faction]] ultimately lost.

Hochschild knew several American volunteers personally, and was partly inspired by them to write the book. Most of Hochschild's [[archival research]] on the subject was carried out at the [[Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives]].

''Spain in Our Hearts'' was generally well-received by critics. Hochschild's writing in particular, was praised for being compelling and well-researched. Many reviewers also commended the book's balanced perspective that covers the atrocities committed by both factions in the war. In his lukewarm review, [[William Deresiewicz]] felt that the book did not provide adequate context for the war, leaving many of the questions the book raises unanswered.&lt;ref name=harpers/&gt;

==Background and development==
[[File:George Orwell press photo.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[George Orwell]]'s ''(pictured)'' ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' spurred Hochschild's interest in the [[Spanish Civil War]]]]

Hochschild was first drawn to write about the [[Spanish Civil War]] due to his personal associations with several Americans who had volunteered in the war. Hochschild's interest in the topic was deepened by his high regard for ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'', [[George Orwell]]'s personal account of his experiences in the war, as well as Hochschild's observation that the war was the only time that many Americans had risked their lives in another nation's civil war.&lt;ref name=histnews/&gt;

Hochschild began his research for ''Spain in Our Hearts'' by spending months reading books and articles about the participation of American volunteers in the Spanish Civil War, so as to determine the main characters in his book. After narrowing down the focus of his book, Hochschild conducted extensive [[archival research]], particularly at the [[Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives]], whose collection includes the writings of hundreds of the American volunteers. While visiting the [[Hoover Institution Library and Archives]], Hochschild was introduced to the writings of [[Lois Orr]] who then became a major character in his book.&lt;ref name=histnews/&gt;

===Title===
The title for the book is taken from a quote by French philosopher [[Albert Camus]] on the Spanish Civil War: "Men of my generation have had Spain in our hearts. It was there that they learned ... that one can be right and yet be beaten, that force can vanquish spirit and that there are times when courage is not rewarded."&lt;ref name=nyt2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/books/review-adam-hochschilds-spain-in-our-hearts-about-a-strangely-literary-conflict.html|title=Review: Adam Hochschild’s 'Spain in Our Hearts,' About a Strangely Literary Conflict|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 24, 2016|first=Dwight|last=Garner|authorlink=Dwight Garner (critic)|accessdate=March 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RETRATO DEL GRAL. FRANCISCO FRANCO BAHAMONDE.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Francisco Franco]] was the leader of the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist faction]]]]
''Spain in Our Hearts'' is an account of the American volunteers who participated in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name=newrepublic/&gt; The civil war was fought between the [[Left-wing politics|left]]-leaning [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]] who were loyal to the democratically-elected [[Second Spanish Republic]], and the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] who were led by General [[Francisco Franco]].&lt;ref name=newrepublic/&gt; While the Nationalists were backed by foreign [[Fascism|fascist]] leaders [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]], the Republicans were not supported by other Western democratic governments due to their [[communist]]-leaning ideologies.&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt; Despite this, many left-wing Americans volunteered to fight on the side of the Republicans, forming the [[Lincoln Battalion]] of the [[International Brigades]].&lt;ref name=latimes1/&gt; The book is told as a collective biography&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/03/books/review/spain-in-our-hearts-by-adam-hochschild.html|title='Spain in Our Hearts,' by Adam Hochschild|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 29, 2016|first=Michael|last=Kazin|authorlink=Michael Kazin|accessdate=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of several American volunteers and journalists, namely, [[Robert Hale Merriman]], an Economics doctoral student who commandeered the Lincoln Battalion; [[Lois Orr]], a member of the [[POUM]] female militia; and journalists [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Louis Fischer]] and [[Virginia Cowles]]. [[George Orwell]], a British novelist and volunteer fighter in the POUM militia, and [[Jason Gurney]], a British sculptor who fought in the International Brigades, are also major characters. Merriman serves as the central figure and the book begins with his disappearance during battle in April 1938.&lt;ref name=latimes1/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/12/spain-in-our-hearts-americans-in-the-spanish-civil-war-1936-1939-by-adam-hochschild-review|title=Spain in Our Hearts: Americans in the Spanish Civil War 1936–1939 by Adam Hochschild – review|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=May 12, 2016|first=Rich|last=Benjamin|authorlink=Rich Benjamin|accessdate=March 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hochschild explains the motivations of the American volunteers, who fought on the side of the Republicans due to their opposition to fascism and their support of communism. Severely lacking in equipment and training, the Lincoln Battalion suffered heavy losses such as in the [[Battle of Brunete]] in 1937. While the Republicans received limited aid from [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Soviet Union]], the [[arms embargo]] that the United States, United Kingdom and France had imposed on Spain meant that they could not buy the weapons needed to fight against the Nationalists, who were being armed by Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy.&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian1/&gt; As such, Hochschild explains that many of the Republicans' attacks and strategies were not made for the purpose of direct victory, but instead were meant to convince Western powers to commit to supporting them.

Hochschild discusses the impact [[Texaco]] chairman, [[Torkild Rieber]], had on the civil war. Rieber was sympathetic to fascist regimes and illegally supplied cheap oil on credit to the Nationalists in direct violation of the American arms embargo.&lt;ref name=harpers/&gt; Hochschild explains how [[Stalinist]] repressed the non-communist [[leftist]]s and anti-Stalinist [[POUM]] members, which in turn disillusioned many of the American volunteers.&lt;ref name=guardian1/&gt;&lt;ref name=eiorg/&gt; George Orwell was inspired by the experience to write ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'',&lt;ref name=newrepublic/&gt; and anti-Stalinism was a key theme in his later works such as ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.

Hochschild points out that Hitler and Mussolini used the Spanish Civil War to test out weapons and strategies that they would later employ in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes1/&gt; This includes the 1937 [[bombing of Guernica]] which was the first ever aerial bombing of civilians by a military air force.&lt;ref name=harpers/&gt; Hochschild concludes that Western intervention would have prevented the Nationalist victory in the civil war, but ultimately would not have prevented World War II. The book's final chapter details Merriman's death, with quotes from his widow's letters, and ends with an American woman travelling in 2012 to an old battleground site to honor her uncle's death in 1938.&lt;ref name=guardian1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hochschild |first=Adam |date=April 7, 2016|title=Spain in Our Hearts: Americans in the Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939|chapter=Kaddish|url= |location= |publisher= [[Pan Macmillan]]|page=372 |isbn=9780547526959 |author-link=Adam Hochschild }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main characters, many of whom are little known, were considered compelling by reviewers.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian1/&gt;&lt;ref name=postcourier/&gt; Hochschild's use of writings from the war{{ndash}}ranging from reports by writers such as [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[André Malraux]], to letters between [[Martha Gellhorn]] and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]{{ndash}}was seen as a strength that enhanced the book.&lt;ref name=guardian1/&gt;&lt;ref name=lareview/&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'' also gave Hochschild credit for "giv[ing] voice" to obscure writers through his comprehensive archival work that unyielded the previously unpublished writings of numerous American volunteers.&lt;ref name=lareview/&gt;

''[[The New Republic]]'' was very complimentary of the book, declaring that it surpasses [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' as the "best introduction" to the Spanish Civil War written in English.&lt;ref name=newrepublic&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/133146/spain-orwell-never-saw|title=The Spain Orwell Never Saw|work=[[The New Republic]]|date=April 28, 2016|first=Patrick|last=Iber|accessdate=March 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
