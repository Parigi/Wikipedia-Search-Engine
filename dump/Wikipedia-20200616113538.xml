Announced in July 2017, it is the first Tarantino film not to involve [[Bob Weinstein|Bob]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]], as Tarantino ended his partnership with the brothers following the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases|sexual abuse allegations against the latter]].

Pitt, DiCaprio, Robbie, [[Zoë Bell]], [[Kurt Russell]], and others joined the cast between January and June 2018. [[Principal photography]] lasted from June through November around Los Angeles. This was the final film to feature [[Luke Perry]], who died on March 4, 2019.

The film has grossed $374 million worldwide and received praise from critics for Tarantino's screenplay and direction, acting, cinematography, costume design, production values, and soundtrack.

&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. --&gt;
In February 1969, veteran [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] actor Rick Dalton, star of 1950s [[Western (genre)|Western]] television series ''Bounty Law'', fears his career is fading. Casting agent Marvin Schwarz recommends he make [[Spaghetti Western]]s in Italy, which Dalton feels are beneath him. Dalton's best friend and [[stunt double]], Cliff Booth—a war [[veteran]] skilled in hand-to-hand combat&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Quentin Tarantino defends Bruce Lee scene in 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' |url=https://us.blastingnews.com/showbiz-tv/2019/08/quentin-tarantino-defends-bruce-lee-scene-in-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-002965405.html |accessdate=January 6, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191104220815/https://us.blastingnews.com/showbiz-tv/2019/08/quentin-tarantino-defends-bruce-lee-scene-in-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-002965405.html |archive-date=November 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; who lives in a tiny trailer with his [[pit bull]], Brandy—drives Dalton around Los Angeles because Dalton's driver's license has been suspended due to [[DUI]]. Booth struggles to find stunt work in Hollywood because of rumors he murdered his wife. Actress [[Sharon Tate]] and her husband, director [[Roman Polanski]], have moved [[10050 Cielo Drive|next door to Dalton]], who dreams of befriending them to revive his declining acting career. That night, Tate and Polanski attend a celebrity-filled party at the [[Playboy Mansion]].

The next day, while repairing Dalton's TV antenna, Booth reminisces about a [[sparring]] contest he had with [[Bruce Lee]] on the set of ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]'' which resulted in Booth being fired. Meanwhile, [[Charles Manson]] stops by the Polanski residence looking for [[Record producer|producer]] [[Terry Melcher]], who used to live there, but is turned away by [[Jay Sebring]]. Tate goes for errands and stops at a movie theater to watch herself in the film ''[[The Wrecking Crew (1968 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]''.

Dalton is cast to play the villain in the pilot of ''[[Lancer (TV series)|Lancer]]'', and strikes up a conversation with his eight-year-old co-star, Trudi Fraser. During filming, Dalton struggles to remember his lines and later suffers a breakdown in his trailer as a result. He subsequently delivers a strong performance that impresses Fraser and the director, [[Sam Wanamaker]], bolstering his confidence.

While driving Dalton's car, Booth picks up a female hitchhiker named Pussycat, whom he takes to [[Spahn Ranch]], where Booth once worked on the set of ''Bounty Law.'' He takes notice of the many [[hippie]]s living there (the [[Manson Family]]). Suspecting they may be taking advantage of the ranch's owner, [[George Spahn]], Booth insists on checking on him despite [[Lynette Fromme|"Squeaky" Fromme]]'s objections. Booth finally speaks with Spahn, who dismisses his concerns. Upon leaving, Booth discovers that [[Steve "Clem" Grogan]] has slashed a tire on Dalton's car; Booth beats him and forces him to change the tire. [[Tex Watson]] is summoned to deal with the situation but he arrives as Booth is driving away.

After watching Dalton's guest performance on an episode of ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', Schwarz books him as the lead in [[Sergio Corbucci]]'s next Spaghetti Western, ''Nebraska Jim''. Dalton takes Booth with him for a six-month stint in Italy, during which time he films two additional Westerns and a [[Eurospy film|Eurospy]] comedy, and marries Italian starlet Francesca Capucci. With a new wife, Dalton informs Booth he can no longer afford his services.

On the evening of August 8, 1969, their first day back in Los Angeles, Dalton and Booth go out for drinks to commemorate their time working together and then return to Dalton's house. Tate and Sebring go out for dinner with friends and then return to Tate's house. Booth smokes an [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]]-laced cigarette purchased earlier from a hippy girl and takes Brandy for a walk while Dalton prepares drinks. Manson Family members Tex, [[Susan Atkins|Sadie]], [[Linda Kasabian|Flowerchild]], and [[Patricia Krenwinkel|Katie]] arrive outside in preparation to [[Tate–LaBianca murders|murder everyone in Tate's house]]. Dalton hears their loud car and orders them off his street. Recognizing Dalton, the Manson Family members [[Alternate history|change their plans]] and decide to kill him instead, after Sadie reasons that Hollywood has "taught them to murder". Flowerchild deserts the group, speeding off with their car. They break into Dalton's house and confront Capucci and Booth, who recognizes them from his visit to Spahn Ranch. Booth orders Brandy to attack, and together they kill Katie and Tex and injure Sadie, though Booth is stabbed and knocked unconscious in the altercation. Sadie stumbles outside, alarming Dalton, who is in his pool listening to music on headphones, oblivious to the melee inside. Dalton retrieves a flamethrower previously used in a movie and incinerates Sadie. After Booth is taken to the hospital to treat his injuries, Sebring engages Dalton in conversation outside and Dalton receives an invitation for a drink with Tate and her friends at her house, which he accepts.

== Production ==
=== Writing and development ===
[[File:Quentin Tarantino by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Director [[Quentin Tarantino]] developed the idea over the course of several years, looking to tell a "[[fairy tale]]" set in 1960s [[Hollywood]].]]
The work that would become the screenplay for ''Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'' was developed slowly over several years by Tarantino. While he knew he wanted the work to be titled ''Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'', evoking the idea of a fairy tale set in 1960s Hollywood, he publicly referred to the project as ''Magnum Opus''.&lt;ref name="esquire may2019"&gt;{{cite magazine | url = https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a27458589/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-leonardo-dicaprio-brad-pitt-quentin-tarantino-interview/ | title = Quentin Tarantino, Brad Pitt, and Leonardo DiCaprio Take You Inside 'Once Upon a Time...In Hollywood' | first = Michael | last = Hainey | date = May 21, 2019 | accessdate = January 19, 2020 | magazine = [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191004074617/https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a27458589/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-leonardo-dicaprio-brad-pitt-quentin-tarantino-interview/ | archive-date = October 4, 2019 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The life of the work for the first five years was as a novel,&lt;ref name="esquire may2019"/&gt; which Tarantino considered to be an exploratory approach to the story he wanted to tell, not yet having decided if it would be a screenplay. Tarantino tried other writing approaches: the early scene between DiCaprio's Dalton and Pacino's Marvin Schwarz was originally written as a one-act play as part of this exploratory work.&lt;ref name="gamespot inspiration"/&gt;

Tarantino discovered the centerpiece for the work in 2009 while filming a movie with an actor that had the same stunt double for 20 years. Even though there was nothing but a small bit for the stuntman to do, Tarantino was asked to use him, and he agreed. The relationship fascinated Tarantino and inspired him to make a film about Hollywood.&lt;ref name=recut/&gt; Tarantino said that while the stuntman may have been a perfect double for the actor years earlier, at the time he had come to meet them, "this was maybe the last or second-to-last thing they'd be doing together".&lt;ref name="gamespot inspiration"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/quentin-tarantino-reveals-inspiration-behind-once-/1100-6472880/ | title = Quentin Tarantino Reveals Inspiration Behind Once Upon A Time In Hollywood | first = James | last = O'Conner | date = January 19, 2020 | accessdate = January 19, 2020 | work = [[GameSpot]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200120073855/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/quentin-tarantino-reveals-inspiration-behind-once-/1100-6472880/ | archive-date = January 20, 2020 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarantino first created Cliff Booth, giving him a massive backstory. Then, the actor Booth was the stunt double for Rick Dalton. Tarantino decided to have them be [[Sharon Tate]]'s next-door neighbors in 1969. The first plot point he developed was the ending, then moved backwards from there, this being the first time Tarantino had worked this way. He thought of doing an [[Elmore Leonard]]-type story, but realized he was confident enough in his characters to let them drive the film and let it be a day in the life of Booth, Dalton, and Tate. He would use sequences from Dalton's films for the action, inspired by [[Richard Rush (director)|Richard Rush]]'s ''[[The Stunt Man]]'', which used the scenes from the [[WWI]] movie they were making within the film as the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |last=Lattanzio |first=Ryan |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/08/quentin-tarantino-paul-thomas-anderson-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-podcast-1202168301 |title=Listen to Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson Talk 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' |website=[[IndieWire]] |access-date=September 5, 2019 |date=August 24, 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829013436/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/08/quentin-tarantino-paul-thomas-anderson-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-podcast-1202168301/ |archivedate=August 29, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, to get his mind into the Dalton character, Tarantino wrote out five hypothetical episodes of the fictional television show ''Bounty Law'', in which Dalton had starred, having become fascinated with the amount of story crammed into half-hour episodes of 1950s western shows. Tarantino has expressed interest in turning these five scripts, as well as ideas for three more, into an actual ''Bounty Law'' television series in the future.&lt;ref name=Tarantino-Deadline-Interview/&gt;

=== Pre-production ===
On July 11, 2017, it was announced that [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s next film would be about the [[Manson Family]] murders. [[Harvey Weinstein|Harvey]] and [[Bob Weinstein]] would be involved, but it was not known whether [[The Weinstein Company]] would distribute the film, as Tarantino sought to cast before sending out a package to studios. Tarantino approached [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Jennifer Lawrence]] to star in the film. It was reported that [[Margot Robbie]] was being considered for [[Sharon Tate]].&lt;ref name="FirsReportedTHR"/&gt; [[Samuel L. Jackson]] was in talks for a major role, and Pitt was in talks for the detective investigating the murders.&lt;ref name="FirsReportedDeadline"/&gt;

After the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations]], Tarantino cut ties with Weinstein and sought a new distributor, after having worked with Weinstein for his entire career. At this point, [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] was revealed to be among a short list of actors Tarantino was considering for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fleming Jr |first1=Mike |title=Quentin Tarantino Seeking New Movie Home: Studios Reading #9 This Week |url=https://deadline.com/2017/11/quentin-tarantino-new-home-studios-reading-number-9-harvey-weinstein-1202199806/ |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=November 8, 2017 |date=November 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108094853/http://deadline.com/2017/11/quentin-tarantino-new-home-studios-reading-number-9-harvey-weinstein-1202199806/|archive-date=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short time later, reports circulated that studios were bidding for the film set in Los Angeles in the late 1960s, that [[Tom Cruise]] was in talks for one of the leads, and that [[David Heyman]] had joined as a producer, along with Tarantino and [[Shannon McIntosh (filmmaker)|Shannon McIntosh]].&lt;ref name="HeymanProducer"/&gt;

When casting the leads, Tarantino invited Pitt, DiCaprio, and Robbie to his house to read the only copy of the full script, to prevent leaks. When Butler auditioned, he did not know which character it was for. Tarantino told him it was for a villain or a hero on ''Lancer'', when in fact it was for [[Tex Watson|"Tex" Watson]]. To prepare for her audition, [[Maya Hawke]] practiced with her father, [[Ethan Hawke]]. She said the process was unlike any other except maybe auditioning for drama school, and during it they worked on the scene in many different ways, with different combinations of people. Willis auditioned for two roles, neither of which she got, then was offered the part of [[Joanna Pettet]]. [[Sydney Sweeney]] said everyone she auditioned with did so for the same character, then were told they could do extra credit. Some did artwork, and she wrote a letter in character. [[Julia Butters]] says her sitcom ''[[American Housewife]]'' was on while Tarantino was writing her character, Trudi Fraser. He looked up and said, "Maybe she can try this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gardner |first=Chris |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/quentin-tarantinos-once-a-time-hollywood-manson-family-actors-detail-unconventional-audition-process-1226543 |title="Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" Actors Detail Quentin Tarantino's "Unconventional" Prcoess |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date=September 4, 2019 |date=July 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190731051119/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/rambling-reporter/quentin-tarantinos-once-a-time-hollywood-manson-family-actors-detail-unconventional-audition-process-1226543 |archive-date=July 31, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarantino's directive was to turn Los Angeles of 2018 into Los Angeles of 1969 without [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]].&lt;ref name="afar"/&gt; For this, Tarantino tapped into previous collaborators for production: editor [[Fred Raskin]], cinematographer [[Robert Richardson (cinematographer)|Robert Richardson]], sound editor [[Wylie Stateman]] and makeup artist Heba Thorisdottir. He also brought first-time collaborators production designer Barbara Ling based on her work in recreating historical settings in ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', and costume designer [[Arianne Phillips]], who had a strong client list to her name including [[Tom Ford]], [[James Mangold]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].&lt;ref name="variety making 60s"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2020/artisans/production/quentin-tarantino-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-2-1203484354/ | title = Quentin Tarantino on Re-Creating 1960s L.A. for 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' | first = Jazz | last = Tangcay | date = January 29, 2020 | accessdate = January 29, 2020 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200129201909/https://variety.com/2020/artisans/production/quentin-tarantino-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-2-1203484354/ | archive-date = January 29, 2020 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To film at the Pussycat Theater, production designer Barbara Ling and her team covered the building's [[LED]] signage and reattached the theater's iconic logo, rebuilding the letters and neon. Ling said the lettering on every marquee in the film is historically accurate. To restore Larry Edmund's Bookshop, she reproduced the original storefront sign and tracked down period-appropriate merchandise, even recreating book covers. For the Bruin and Fox Village theaters Ling's team restored the theaters, their marquees, and the storefronts around them. Stan's Donuts, across the street from the Bruin, got a complete makeover.&lt;ref name="afar"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wakim |first=Marielle |url=https://www.afar.com/magazine/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-filming-locations-you-can-visit-in-los-angeles |title='Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood' Filming Locations You Can Visit in Los Angeles |website=[[Afar (magazine)|Afar]] |access-date=September 2, 2019 |date=July 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903051130/https://www.afar.com/magazine/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-filming-locations-you-can-visit-in-los-angeles |archive-date=September 3, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarantino and Ling met with the new owner to discuss the parts of the property which they wanted to use, but he was reluctant since the property was in the middle of a renovation. After long negotiations he agreed, and Ling was able to dress the vacant mansion, front courtyard, and backyard for the party scene, evoking as much of the 1960s appearance of the mansion as possible.&lt;ref name=recreating-Hollywood/&gt;

The scenes involving the Tate–Polanski house were not filmed at Cielo Drive, the winding street where the 3,200 square-foot house once stood. The original house was razed in 1994 and replaced with a mansion nearly six-times the size. Scenes involving the Tate-Polanski house were filmed at three different locations around Los Angeles: one for the interior scenes, one for the scenes showing the exterior of the old house, and a Universal City location for the many scenes depicting the iconic cul-de-sac driveway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/recreate-sharon-tate-s-benedict-canyon-house-quentin-tarantino-turned-a-la-tour-guide-1227436 |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 10, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203050926/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/recreate-sharon-tate-s-benedict-canyon-house-quentin-tarantino-turned-a-la-tour-guide-1227436 |archive-date=February 3, 2020 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''Bounty Law'', Ling went for a dusty, dirty, early ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' look. Movie poster artist [[Steven Chorney]] created the poster for the film, as a reference to ''[[The Mod Squad]]''. He also created the posters for ''Nebraska Jim'', ''Operation Dyn-O-Mite'', ''Uccidimi Subito Ringo Disse il Gringo'', ''Hell-Fire Texas'', and ''Comanche Uprising'', which was reprinted for Dalton's home parking spot. [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'']] magazine caricaturist [[Tom Richmond (illustrator)|Tom Richmond]] created the covers of ''Mad'' and ''[[TV Guide]]'' featuring Dalton's Jake Cahill. Spahn Ranch was recreated in detail over about a three-month period.

Tarantino told cinematographer [[Robert Richardson (cinematographer)|Robert Richardson]], "I want it to feel retro but I want it to be contemporary." Richardson shot in [[Kodak]] [[35 mm movie film|35mm]] with [[Panavision]] cameras and lenses, in order to weave time periods. For ''Bounty Law'' they shot in black and white, and brief sequences in [[Super 8 film|Super 8]] and [[16mm]] [[Ektachrome]]. In the film, ''[[Lancer (TV series)|Lancer]]'' was shot on a retrofitted Western Street backlot at [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]], designed by Ling. Richardson crossed ''Lancer'' with ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]]'' for the retro-future look Tarantino wanted. The way they filmed ''Lancer'' was not possible in 1969, but Tarantino wanted his personal touch on it. Richardson said that filming the movie touched him personally, "The film speaks to all of us... We are all fragile beings with a limited time to achieve whatever it is we desire... that at any moment that place will shift... So take stock in life and have the courage to believe in yourself."&lt;ref name=recreating-hollywood&gt;{{cite web |last=Han |first=Karen |url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/28/8932339/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-quentin-tarantino-playboy-mansion |title=What it took to get the Playboy Mansion for Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |access-date=September 3, 2019 |date=July 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906142247/https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/28/8932339/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-quentin-tarantino-playboy-mansion |archive-date=September 6, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Desowitz |first=Bill |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-cinematographer-robert-richardson-quentin-tarantino-1969-1202159937/ |title="Once Upon a Time in Hollywood": How Cinematographer Robert Richardson captured 1969 in 2019 |website=[[IndieWire]] |access-date=September 3, 2019 |date=July 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723131120/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-cinematographer-robert-richardson-quentin-tarantino-1969-1202159937/ |archive-date=July 23, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical accuracy ==
In a scene, Sharon Tate goes into Larry Edmunds Bookshop and purchases a copy of ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]''. In real life, Tate gave a copy to Roman Polanski shortly before her death. Years later, Polanski directed the film adaptation, ''[[Tess (1979 film)|Tess]]'', dedicating it to Tate. Dalton mentions he owns his house on advice from "[[Edmond O'Brien|Eddie O'Brien]]." Tate and Polanski's [[Yorkie Terrier]] in the film is named "Dr. Sapirstein," as was Tate's Yorkie in real life, named after the doctor portrayed by [[Ralph Bellamy]] in ''Rosemary's Baby''. The carrier she puts the dog in is the same one the real Tate actually owned. The outfit Margot Robbie wears in the Bruin Theater scene is the same one Tate wore in ''[[Eye of the Devil]]''.&lt;ref name=geek-easter-eggs/&gt;

[[File:Fox Bruin Theater (Westwood).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Fox Bruin Theater]]]]

In the film, Tate goes to see ''[[The Wrecking Crew (1968 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]'' at the [[Bruin Theater]]. She convinces the theater's employees that she stars in the movie after they fail to recognize her. Tarantino stated the idea came to him from an experience he had. When ''[[True Romance]]'' was released, he saw it at the same theater, where he eventually convinced its employees that he wrote the script.&lt;ref name=cinema-blend&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Connell |first=Sean |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/podcast/2476541/will-quentin-tarantinos-last-movie-be-star-trek-the-director-talks-about-a-loophole |title=Will Quentin Tarantino's Last Movie Be Star Trek?

On the set of ''[[Batman (TV show)|Batman]]'', for a crossover episode with ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]'', a fight was scripted with Kato (Bruce Lee) losing to [[Robin (character)|Robin]] ([[Burt Ward]]). When Lee received the script, he refused to do it, so it was changed to a draw. When the cameras rolled, Lee stalked Ward until Ward backed away. Lee laughed and told him he was "lucky it is a TV show."&lt;ref name=Kato-show&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newsweek.com/bruce-lee-king-fu-martial-arts-390811 |title=The Kato Show: Bruce Lee as the Green Hornet's Sidekick |website=[[Newsweek]] |access-date=August 26, 2019 |date=November 20, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831111350/https://www.newsweek.com/bruce-lee-king-fu-martial-arts-390811 |archive-date=August 31, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Cliff Booth reminisces about fighting Lee on the set of ''The Green Hornet''; the fight is interrupted before its conclusion, after each fighter has won one round each.

According to Rudolph Altobelli, who rented the house to Polanski and Tate, in March 1969, Charles Manson showed up looking for [[Terry Melcher]]. Polanski's friend Shahrokh Hatami also said he saw Manson enter the grounds. Hatami approached Manson, asking him what he wanted. He told Hatami he was looking for Melcher. Hatami responded the house was the Polanski residence and perhaps Melcher lived in the guest house. Altobelli told Manson that Melcher no longer lived there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Caldwell |first=Earl |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/22/archives/manson-put-at-tate-home-5-months-before-killings.html |title=Manson Put at Tate Home 5 Months Before Killings |website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=August 26, 2019 |date=October 22, 1970 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190826230558/https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/22/archives/manson-put-at-tate-home-5-months-before-killings.html |archive-date=August 26, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happens in the film, with Sebring in place of Altobelli and Hatami.

On the night of August 8, 1969, Patricia Krenwinkel, Charles Watson, and Susan Atkins broke into Polanski's and Tate's house, leading to the murders of Tate (eight-and-a-half months pregnant), Sebring, Wojciech Frykowski, and Abigail Folger.

=== The Manson Family ===
Charles Manson was convicted of the murders of Tate and four others, despite not being present, due mostly to a theory stating he was trying to instigate an [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] race war, in the end leaving only black Muslims and the Manson Family. The black Muslims would eventually look to Manson to lead them.
