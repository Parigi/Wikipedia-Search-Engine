The '''Jena Six''' were six [[African American|black]] teenagers in [[Jena, Louisiana]], convicted in the 2006 beating of Justin Barker, a [[White American|white]] student at the local [[Jena High School]], which they also attended. Barker was injured on December 4, 2006, by the members of the Jena Six, and received treatment at an emergency room. While the case was pending, it was often cited by some media commentators as an example of racial injustice in the United States. Some commentators believed that the defendants had been charged initially with too-serious offenses and had been treated unfairly.

A number of events had taken place in and around Jena in the months before the Barker assault, which the media have associated with an alleged escalation of local racial tensions. These events included the hanging of rope [[noose]]s from a tree in the high school courtyard, two violent confrontations between white and black youths, and the destruction by fire of the main building of Jena High School. Extensive news coverage related to the Jena Six often reported these events as linked.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; Federal and parish attorneys concluded from their investigations that assessment was inaccurate for some of the events; for instance, the burning of the high school was an attempt to destroy grade records.

Six students (Robert Bailey, then aged 17; Mychal Bell, then 16; Carwin Jones, then 18; Bryant Purvis, then 17; Jesse Ray Beard, then 14; and Theo Shaw, then 17) were [[arrest]]ed in the assault of Barker. Mychal Bell was initially convicted as an adult of [[Aggravated assault|aggravated battery]] and [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit aggravated battery. His convictions were overturned on the grounds that he should have been tried as a [[minor (law)|juvenile]]. Before a retrial in [[juvenile court]], Bell pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of [[battery (crime)|simple battery]]. The other five defendants later pleaded "[[no contest]]" to the same offense, and were convicted.

The Jena Six case sparked protests by people who considered the arrests and subsequent charges, initially [[attempted murder|attempted second-degree murder]], as excessive and racially discriminatory. The protesters asserted that white Jena youths involved in similar incidents were treated more leniently. On September 20, 2007, between 15,000 and 20,000&amp;nbsp;protesters marched on Jena in what was described as the "largest civil rights demonstration in years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Andy | last = Gallacher | title = Huge rally in small-town Louisiana | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7005866.stm | work = BBC News | publisher = BBC | location = Jena, Louisiana | date = September 21, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Maria | last = Newman | title = Jena, La. | url = http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/national/usstatesterritoriesandpossessions/louisiana/jena/index.html | work = The New York Times | publisher = The New York Times Company | date = September 24, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Related protests were held in other US cities on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Christine | last = Simmons | title = "Jena 6" Protest at Justice Dept | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/02/AR2007100202254.html | publisher = Associated Press via The Washington Post | location = Washington, D.C. | date = October 2, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent reactions included songs alluding to the Jena Six, numerous editorials and opinion columns, and congressional hearings.

== Background to the assault ==
[[File:Rsz schoolpicture.gif|thumb|right|Jena High School]]

At [[Jena High School]], about 10% of students are black and roughly 90% are white, reflecting the population of the town of Jena, which has about 3,000&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref name="cdata"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.city-data.com/city/Jena-Louisiana.html | title = Jena, Louisiana (LA) Detailed Profile | accessdate = 2008-08-25 |year=2007 | publisher = City-data.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some early reporting indicated that students of different races seldom sat together, for instance in the cafeteria, although this has been disputed.&lt;ref name="whitetree"&gt;{{cite news | first = Todd | last = Lewan | title = Black and White Becomes Gray in La. Town | url = http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2007Sep22/0,4675,APlaceCalledJena,00.html | publisher = Associated Press via ABC News | location = Jena, Louisiana |pages=1–4 | date = September 22, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to early reports of the school environment, black students when outside typically sat on bleachers near the auditorium, while white students sat under a large tree in the center of the school courtyard, referred to as the "white tree" or "[[Preppy|prep]] tree".&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news | first = Wade | last = Goodwyn |author-link=Wade Goodwyn| title = Beating Charges Split La. Town Along Racial Lines | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12353776 | work = All Things Considered | publisher = National Public Radio | date = July 30, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some of the school's teachers and administrators, the tree in question was not a "white tree", and students of all races had sat under it at one time or another.&lt;ref name="whitetree" /&gt;

At a school assembly held on August 31, 2006, a black male freshman asked the principal whether he could sit under the tree.&lt;ref name="stealth"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/this_world/6685441.stm | title = 'Stealth racism' stalks deep South | last = Mangold | first = Tom | work = BBC News | date = August 16, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Donald Washington, [[United States Attorney]] for the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana|Western District of Louisiana]], the principal said the question was posed in a "jocular fashion".&lt;ref name="clearup"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990004 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130204060816/http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990004 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 4, 2013 |title=Official sought to clear up 'Jena Six' 'misinformation' |last=Brown |first=Abbey |newspaper=The Town Talk |location=Alexandria-Pineville, Louisiana |date=July 31, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal told the students they could "sit wherever they wanted".&lt;ref name="stealth" /&gt; CNN reported that the freshman and his friends sat under the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/09/19/jackson.jena6/ | title = Jesse Jackson: Obama needs to bring more attention to Jena 6 | last = Mooney | first = Alexander | publisher = CNN | date = September 19, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Noose hanging ===
The following morning, students and staff discovered rope [[noose]]s hanging from the tree; reports differ as to whether there were two&lt;ref name="whitetree" /&gt; or three&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; nooses. A black teacher described seeing both white and black students "playing with [the nooses], pulling on them, jump-swinging from them, and putting their heads through them" that same day.&lt;ref name="whitetree" /&gt; Craig Franklin, assistant editor of ''The Jena Times'', said the nooses were hung as a prank by three students directed at white members of the school rodeo team. The school's investigating committee had concluded that "the three young teens had no knowledge that nooses symbolize the terrible legacy of the [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings]] of countless blacks in American history".&lt;ref name="MediaMyths" /&gt; The names of those who hung the nooses were not publicly disclosed.

=== Repercussions ===
The school disciplinary process that followed is unclear. It was reported that the principal learned that three white students were responsible and recommended [[Expulsion (academia)|expulsion]], that the [[board of education]] overruled his recommendation, and that school superintendent Roy Breithaupt agreed with the overruling. It was initially reported that the punishment was reduced to three days of in-school suspension.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/03/AR2007080302098.html | title = La. Town Fells 'White Tree,' but Tension Runs Deep | last = Fears | first = Darryl | newspaper = The Washington Post | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | date = August 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the district's Crisis Management Policy Procedures, the three students were isolated at an alternative school "for about a month",&lt;ref name="whitetree" /&gt; spent two weeks on in-school suspension, served Saturday detentions, had to attend Discipline Court, were referred to Families in Need of Services, and had to have an evaluation before they were able to return to school.&lt;ref name="whitetree" /&gt;

The school superintendent was quoted as saying, "Adolescents play pranks. I don't think it was a threat against anybody".&lt;ref name="tribune2"&gt;{{cite news | first = Howard | last = Witt | title = Racial demons rear heads | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-elf2u1mmay20,1,3301167.story | newspaper = Chicago Tribune | location = Jena, Louisiana | date = May 20, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Black residents of Jena have said that this comment stoked racial tensions leading to subsequent events.&lt;ref name="wapo" /&gt;

According to US Attorney Donald Washington, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) investigators found that the hanging of the nooses "had all the markings of a [[hate crime]]". But, it could not be prosecuted as such since juveniles are rarely prosecuted in the federal system, and this offense did not meet departmental standards for charges to be brought.&lt;ref name="notrelated"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/law/09/19/jena.six.link/index.html | title = U.S. Attorney: Nooses, beating at Jena High not related | date = September 19, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | publisher = CNN }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[La Salle Parish, Louisiana|La Salle Parish]] District Attorney [[J. Reed Walters]] stated that Washington had found no federal statute under which the teens could be prosecuted, just as he had found no applicable state statute.&lt;ref name="daoped"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/26/opinion/26walters.html | title = Justice in Jena | date = September 26, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | last = Walters | first = Reed | newspaper = The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Walters opined: "The people that [hung the nooses] should be ashamed of what they unleashed on this town".&lt;ref name="farwell"&gt;{{cite news|first=Scott |last=Farwell |title=North Texans marching behind 6 young men in Jena |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/texassouthwest/stories/092007dnmetjenasetup.3645e08.html |newspaper=The Dallas Morning News |date=September 20, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015073850/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/texassouthwest/stories/092007dnmetjenasetup.3645e08.html |archivedate=October 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school treated the incident seriously and called police to the school in the days after the noose incident.&lt;ref name="whitlock" /&gt; The principal called an assembly on September 6, 2006. The Jena Police Department asked Parish Attorney Walters to attend and speak at the assembly. Already pressed for time due to a case under preparation, Walters felt that the students were not paying proper attention to him. He warned them, "I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. With the stroke of a pen I can make life miserable for you or ruin your life. So I want you to call me before you do something stupid".&lt;ref name="whitlock"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.kansascity.com/sports/columnists/jason_whitlock/story/296701.html | title = Jena 6 case caught up in whirlwind of distortion, opportunism | last = Whitlock | first = Jason | authorlink = Jason Whitlock | date = September 29, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-10-01 | newspaper = The Kansas City Star | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012042224/http://www.kansascity.com/sports/columnists/jason_whitlock/story/296701.html | archivedate = October 12, 2007|url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though black students say Walters was looking at them when he made the comments, Walters and school board member Billy Fowler, also present, deny it.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; Walters said that he was irritated at "two or three girls, white girls, [who] were chit-chatting on their cellphones or playing with their cellphones".&lt;ref name="MediaMyths" /&gt;

=== School arson, fight, and confrontation ===
On November 30, 2006, the main building of the high school was destroyed by arson. Although it would be many months before the perpetrators were known, the news media later widely cited the fire as a racially charged event leading up to the assault on Barker.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt; On December 28, 2007, LaSalle Parish Sheriff- elect Scott Franklin announced that an investigation had shown that the fire was set in an effort to destroy grade records in the building and to close the school for a time. Six male suspects (three juveniles and three adults) had been arrested, and two more adult males were being sought. They were racially diverse. Franklin indicated that the fire was not racially motivated, and had no connection to the Jena Six.&lt;ref name="face charges" /&gt;  Two of the arson defendants pleaded guilty, and were sentenced to ten years in prison, with restitution ordered in the amount of $10 million.&lt;ref name="hot"&gt;{{cite news | title = Three still awaiting trial in Jena High arson case | work = The Town Talk | date = December 13, 2008}} {&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gotta go.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Gotta Go'' convenience store outside Jena, Louisiana]]

On December 1, 2006, a private party was held at the Jena Fair Barn.&lt;ref name="clearup" /&gt; Bailey and four other black youths tried to enter the party at about 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. According to U.S. Attorney Washington, they were told by a woman that no one was allowed inside without an invitation. The youths persisted, stating that some friends were already at the party. A white male, who was not a student, moved in front of the woman and a fight ensued. After the fight broke up, the woman told both the white male and the black students to leave the party. Once outside, the black students were involved in another fight with a group of white males who were not students.&lt;ref name="clearup" /&gt; Justin Sloan, a white male, was charged with [[battery (crime)|battery]] for his role in the fight and was put on probation. Bailey later said that one of the white males broke a beer bottle over his head,&lt;ref name="wapo" /&gt; but there are no records of Bailey receiving medical treatment.&lt;ref name="clearup" /&gt;

The following day, an incident occurred at the ''Gotta Go'' convenience store, outside Jena in unincorporated LaSalle Parish, between Matt Windham and three black youths, including Bailey.&lt;ref name="lasupct"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=State of Louisiana v. Robert Bailey |opinion=Johnson, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari |court = Louisiana Supreme Court | date = December 7, 2007 | url = http://www.lasc.org/opinions/2007/07KK1922.bjj.pdf|format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement reported that their accounts contradicted each other. Windham alleged that Bailey and his friends chased him, that he ran to get his gun, and that the students wrestled it away from him. According to the black students, as they left the convenience store, they were confronted by Windham with a shotgun. They said they wrestled the gun away from him and fled the scene. Bailey was charged with disturbing the peace, second-degree robbery, and theft of a firearm.&lt;ref name="face charges"&gt;{{cite news | first = Elaine | last = McKewon | title = Jena Six timeline | url = http://www.bayoubuzz.com/News/Louisiana/Politics/Jena_Six_Timeline__4731.asp | work = The Bayou Buzz | date = September 21, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-22 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011082448/http://www.bayoubuzz.com/News/Louisiana/Politics/Jena_Six_Timeline__4731.asp | archivedate = October 11, 2007|url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attack on Barker ==
On December 4, 2006, 17-year-old Justin Barker, a white Jena High School student, was punched, kicked, and stomped on while at school by a group of black students. They first said that he had made a racist joke; some changed their account and said their actions were in response to the three nooses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/44275022 | title = 5 years later, Jena 6 move on | date = August 25, 2011 | accessdate = 2015-12-20 | publisher = NBC News | last = Foster | first = Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superintendent Breithaupt described the battery as a "premeditated ambush and attack by six students against one. The victim attacked was beaten and kicked into a state of bloody unconsciousness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = CBS News | title = Jena Six teen to be freed on bail | date = September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Barker was released from a local emergency room after three hours of treatment and observation for a [[concussion]] and an eye that had swollen shut.&lt;ref name="wapo" /&gt; The emergency physician's record shows that he also had injuries to his face, ears, and hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/70916045 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090717110417/http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F99999999%2FNEWS%2F70916045 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 17, 2009 |title=Documents give details about fight |date=June 11, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |newspaper=The Town Talk |last=Brown |first=Abbey }}&lt;/ref&gt; He  attended his school's [[Class ring|class ring ceremony]] and dance that evening. He later testified, "I waited 11&amp;nbsp;years to go to it. I wasn't going to let that get in my way". He left the dance early due to pain.&lt;ref name="testify"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.katc.com/Global/story.asp?S=6719374 | title = Victim in Jena 6 case takes the stand | date = June 11, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-09-20 |agency=Associated Press | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011143108/http://www.katc.com/Global/story.asp?S=6719374 | archivedate = October 11, 2007|url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial, Barker testified that his face was badly swollen after the attack and that he suffered a loss of vision in one eye for three weeks. He said that he has suffered recurring headaches and forgetfulness since the attack.&lt;ref name="forget"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19488285 | title = Black teen convicted in beating of white student | date = July 2, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-09-23 |agency=Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

US Attorney Washington states he does not believe the noose incident and the beatings were related.  Walters likewise said that he believes there is no linkage between the noose incident and the beating. "When this case was brought to me and during our investigation and during the trial, there was no such linkage ever suggested. This compact story line has only been suggested after the fact".&lt;ref name="notrelated" /&gt; Although Washington believes that both the noose hangings and the Barker battery were symptoms of racial tension, he has also said that there was no apparent lingering anger among students at the school after the nooses were found.&lt;ref name="distort"&gt;{{cite news | title = U.S. Attorney: Critics in Jena Six case have distorted the facts | url = http://www.ktbs.com/story/22372203/us-attorney-critics-in-jena-six-case-have-distorted-the-facts | publisher = KTBS-3 | date = April 30, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-05-24 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://archive.today/20141217190658/http://www.ktbs.com/story/22372203/us-attorney-critics-in-jena-six-case-have-distorted-the-facts | archivedate = December 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criminal cases ==
Law enforcement arrested six students, eventually dubbed the "Jena Six", who were accused in the attack on Barker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/law/09/04/bell.jena.six/ | publisher = CNN | title = Residents: Nooses spark school violence, divide town | accessdate = 2007-09-04 | date = September 5, 2007 |author=McLaughlin, Eliott C. &amp; [[Susan Roesgen|Roesgen, Susan]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Five of them (Robert Bailey, Jr., then 17; Mychal Bell, then 16; Carwin Jones, then 18; Bryant Purvis, then 17; and Theo Shaw, then 17) were charged with attempted murder.&lt;ref name="lasupct" /&gt; The sixth student, Jesse Ray Beard (also known as Jesse Rae Beard), was charged as a juvenile. Walters charged Mychal Bell as an adult,&lt;ref name="overturn" /&gt; although he was only 16, because of his previous [[criminal record]] and because Walters believed Bell initiated the attack.&lt;ref name="releaseabc" /&gt;

=== Mychal Bell proceedings ===
District Judge J. P. Mauffray, Jr. presided over Bell's trial. On the first day of trial, June 26, 2007, Walters reduced the charges to aggravated second-degree battery and conspiracy to commit aggravated second-degree battery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/worldlatest/story/0,,-6738454,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025141828/http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0%2C%2C-6738454%2C00.html |archivedate=October 25, 2007 |title=Charges Reduced for Student in La.

Before the trial began, [[public defender]] Blane Williams had urged Bell to accept a [[plea bargain]]. At trial he rested the defense case without calling any witnesses or offering any evidence.&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{cite news | last = Witt | first = Howard | title = Louisiana teen guilty in school beating case; Witnesses provide conflicting testimony | newspaper = Chicago Tribune | date = June 29, 2007 | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-jena_witt.1jun29,1,1872156.story?coll=chi-newsnationworld-hed | accessdate = 2007-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The six members of Bell's jury were [[all-white jury|all white]].

The jury found Bell guilty, and he faced the possibility of up to 22&amp;nbsp;years in prison. The judge scheduled sentencing for September 20, 2007. Bell's new defense attorneys, Bob Noel, Walter Lee Perkins Jr., Peggy Sullivan, Louis Scott and Carol Powell-Lexing, requested a new trial on the grounds that Bell should not have been [[tried as an adult]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990017 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120917194828/http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990017 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 17, 2012 |title=Defense attorney says Bell case should be in juvenile system |date=August 16, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |last=Brown |first=Abbey |newspaper=The Town Talk }}&lt;/ref&gt; A request to lower Bell's $90,000&amp;nbsp;bond was denied on August 24, 2007, due to his juvenile record.

On September 14, 2007, Louisiana's Third Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Bell's battery conviction, agreeing that this remaining charge was not among those for which a juvenile may be tried as an adult.&lt;ref name="overturn"&gt;{{cite news | title = Court overturns conviction in Jena beating | publisher = NBC News | date = September 14, 2007 | url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/20779755 | accessdate = 2007-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 2007, Mauffray found that Bell had violated the terms of his [[probation]] for previous convictions. The judge sentenced Bell to 18 months in a juvenile facility on two counts of simple battery and two counts of criminal destruction of property, and Bell was taken into custody. According to Walters, the matter was unrelated to the assault on Barker, and it had not been referred to during the Barker proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 'Jena Six' teen Mychal Bell back in jail |agency=Associated Press | date = October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The defense filed a motion to dismiss the Barker charges on the ground that retrying Bell would amount to [[double jeopardy]]. On November 8, 2007, Mauffray denied the motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Court rejects motion to dismiss juvenile charges in racial school attacks |agency=Associated Press | date = November 8, 2007 | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/08/america/NA-GEN-US-Racial-School-Attack.php | newspaper=International Herald Tribune |accessdate = 2008-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell's retrial in the Barker assault was scheduled for December 6. Three days before the trial began, he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of battery, and was sentenced to 18&amp;nbsp;months in a juvenile facility, with credit for time served. He agreed to testify against any of the other assault defendants at trial. All appeals were dropped as part of the [[Plea bargain|plea agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bell admits role in attack |newspaper=The Town Talk |last=Brown |first=Abbey |date=December 4, 2007 |url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990133 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120918224933/http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990133 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 18, 2012 |accessdate=2007-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Remaining defendants ===
On September 4, 2007, charges against Carwin Jones and Theo Shaw were reduced to aggravated second-degree battery and conspiracy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Charges Reduced in 'Jena 6' Attack | publisher = Associated Press via The Washington Post | date = September 4, 2007 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/04/AR2007090401047.html | accessdate = 2007-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as were those of Robert Bailey, Jr. on September 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Another Charge Reduced in 'Jena 6' Case | publisher = KYW-TV | date = September 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant Purvis was arraigned on reduced charges of aggravated battery and conspiracy to commit aggravated battery on November 7, 2007, and pleaded not guilty.&lt;ref name="nov7towntalk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Final 'Jena Six' defendant, Purvis, pleads not guilty to reduced charges |newspaper=The Town Talk |date=November 8, 2007 |url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990122 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130204080735/http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990122 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 4, 2013 |accessdate=2008-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Louisiana law considers seventeen-year-olds to be adults for purposes of criminal culpability, the charges for these four were unaffected by the appellate ruling overturning Bell's conviction.&lt;ref name="overturn" /&gt;

Proceedings were on hold for some time pending resolution of various motions to require Mauffray to [[Judicial disqualification#Recusal in the United States|recuse himself]]. On July 31, 2008, Mauffray was removed from the cases by Judge Thomas Yeager for making questionable comments about the defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Judge in Jena 6 case is removed | work = Detroit Free Press | date = August 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Louisiana Supreme Court]] assigned Judge Yeager to hear the five remaining cases by order signed August 4, 2008.&lt;ref name="Yeager"&gt;{{cite news | title = Judge Yeager to hear 'Jena Six' cases | work = The Town Talk | date = August 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Walters appealed the recusal order, but his appeal was dismissed on March 4, 2009, as moot, or no longer relevant, as Mauffray had left the bench at the end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Appeals court: "Jena Six" recusal issue moot point | work = The Town Talk | date = March 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2009, the remaining five defendants entered pleas of "no contest" to a charge of simple battery.&lt;ref name="ttover"&gt;{{cite news|title='Jena Six' case ends: Remaining 5 defendants given 7 days probation, apologize |work=The Town Talk |date=June 27, 2009 |url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20090627/NEWS01/906270304/-1/NEWSFRONT2/-Jena-Six--case-ends--Remaining-5-defendants-given-7-days-probation--apologize |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130205014318/http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20090627/NEWS01/906270304/-1/NEWSFRONT2/-Jena-Six--case-ends--Remaining-5-defendants-given-7-days-probation--apologize |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 5, 2013 |accessdate=2009-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court found them guilty as charged, and sentenced each to a fine of $500 (waived in regards to Shaw due to the time he spent in jail), $500 to be paid as court costs, restitution to be paid to the Barker family (with whom the defendants were ordered to have no contact), and seven days of unsupervised probation.  The defendants' lawyers read a statement apologizing to the Barker family and to the town. Addressing the rumors that the attack had been provoked by Barker using a racial epithet, they said on behalf of the defendants:&lt;ref name="over"&gt;{{cite news | last = Morgan | first = Robert | title = Five defendants plead no contest in 'Jena Six' case | work = CNN | date = June 26, 2009 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/06/26/louisiana.jena.6/ | accessdate = 2009-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;To be clear, not one of us heard Justin use any slur or say anything that justified Mychal Bell attacking Justin nor did any of us see Justin do anything that would cause Mychal to react.&lt;ref name="ttover" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yeager, who presided over the plea and sentencing, also ordered the youths to avoid criminal activity, and not to disavow the statement made on their behalf in court.&lt;ref name="ttover" /&gt;  On June 26, it was announced that the civil case by Barker against the Jena Six members had been settled on undisclosed terms. His civil case against the school board was pending.&lt;ref name="ttciv"&gt;{{cite news|last=Morgan |first=Robert |title=Secret settlement reached in 'Jena Six' civil suit |work=The Town Talk |date=June 27, 2009 |url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20090627/NEWS01/906270303/-1/NEWSFRONT2/Secret-settlement-reached-in--Jena-Six--civil-suit |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130419015344/http://www.thetowntalk.com/article/20090627/NEWS01/906270303/-1/NEWSFRONT2/Secret-settlement-reached-in--Jena-Six--civil-suit |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 19, 2013 |accessdate=2009-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media coverage ==
===News coverage===
Initially, the Jena Six were largely ignored by the United States national media, though covered locally and within Louisiana. Both ''The Jena Times''&lt;ref name="MediaMyths"/&gt; and ''The Town Talk'' (a regional newspaper published in [[Alexandria, Louisiana]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jena Six|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/70915030|work=The Town Talk|date=September 3, 2007|accessdate=2008-09-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130204054648/http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/70915030|archivedate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; covered the story from its inception. A number of African-American bloggers also covered the story before there was mainstream national press coverage.&lt;ref name="blogs help drive" /&gt; The first piece on the case to be published by an outside source ran on May 9, 2007, in ''[[Left Turn (magazine)|Left Turn]]'', a small [[alternative news]] magazine.&lt;ref name="Leftturn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leftturn.mayfirst.org/?q=node/649 |title=Justice in Jena |accessdate=2007-10-20 |date=May 9, 2007 |last=Flaherty |first=Jordan |publisher=Left Turn Magazine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011212346/http://leftturn.mayfirst.org/?q=node%2F649 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mainstream US print media outlet to cover the matter was the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', whose Southwest Bureau Chief, Howard Witt, wrote a piece covering the story on May 20.&lt;ref name="tribune2"/&gt; Witt had received a summary of the situation&lt;ref name="foj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://friendsofjustice.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/responding_to_the_crisis_in_jena1.doc|title=Responding to the crisis in Jena, Louisiana|accessdate=2007-10-22|publisher=Friends of Justice |format=DOC}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Alan Bean (activist)|Alan Bean]], a Texas minister who had founded the advocacy group Friends of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://friendsofjustice.wordpress.com/2007/10/02/howard-witt-responds-indirectly-to-jason-whitlock|title=Howard Witt Responds (indirectly) to Jason Whitlock|accessdate=2008-08-22|date=October 2, 2007|publisher=Friends of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group sent its document to other reporters and bloggers. In it Bean demanded that outside authorities, not those in LaSalle Parish, deal with the case, and that no incarceration of the defendants occur.&lt;ref name="foj"/&gt; [[United Kingdom|Britain's]] ''[[The Observer]]'' also featured an article on the case on May 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom|last=Mangold|title=Racism goes on trial again in America's Deep South|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,2083762,00.html|work=The Observer|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|location=Jena, Louisiana|date=May 20, 2007|accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A segment on a [[BBC]] program ''[[This World (television programme)|This World]]'' followed on May 24.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/6677057.stm "Race Hate in Louisiana"], ''This World'', bbc.co.uk, May 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The case began to receive more extensive national media coverage in July 2007, with [[CNN]] interviewing Jena residents and parents of those involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2007/07/01/roesgen.la.jena.6.update.affl?iref=videosearch CNN segment from Jena], CNN Newsroom video, July 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the racial history of the Deep South, many news reports from Jena evoked the [[Civil Rights Movement]], referred to historic [[lynching]], or [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]].&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;

Some sources pointed to inaccurate reporting by the media. The [[Associated Press]] published an article noting the various reporting errors that have been made, including whether the tree was a "white tree", the number of nooses, and the discipline given to the noose-hanging students.&lt;ref name="whitetree"/&gt; Based on this, MTV posted a retraction for incorrect information that it had reported on the case from other news sources.&lt;ref name="MTVerror"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1570444/20070924/id_0.jhtml|title=Jena Report Attempts To Sift Fact From Fiction; FBI Probes White-Supremacist Response|accessdate=2007-09-27|date=September 24, 2007|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Columnists and editorials ===
Many major editorial pages and columnists have been sympathetic to the supporters of the Jena Six. They have used the case to discuss broader trends of racism in the US criminal justice system and to call for a renewed civil rights movement. Most editorials were published around the time of the Jena rally. ''[[The New York Post]]'', in a September 23, 2007, editorial, stated "it's impossible to examine the case of the so-called Jena Six without concluding that these black teens have been the victims of a miscarriage of justice, with a clearly racial double standard at work".&lt;ref name="nyposted"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nypost.com/seven/09232007/postopinion/editorials/the_jena_six.htm | title = The Jena Six | accessdate = 2007-10-23 | date = September 23, 2007 | newspaper = New York Post }}&lt;/ref&gt; Byron Williams, writing on the ''[[Huffington Post]]'', was one of several to cite the [[Urban League]]'s 2005 finding that the average black male convicted of aggravated assault serves 48&amp;nbsp;months in prison, one-third longer than a comparable white man.&lt;ref name="ByronWilliams"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/byron-williams/oldfashioned-southern-ju_b_65178.html | title = Old Fashioned Southern Justice in the Modern South | work = The Huffington Post | date = September 20, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | last = Williams | first = Byron }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005 report also found that a black male who is arrested is three times more likely to go to jail than a white male arrested for the same crime.&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/features/july-dec07/jena_9-24.html | title = Jena Six Rally Highlights Racial Tensions | date = September 24, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | last = Miller | first = Talea | publisher = PBS }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/21/2040080.htm | title = Jena 6 case sparks anti-racism protest | accessdate = 2007-09-27 | date = September 21, 2007 | last = Landers | first = Kim | publisher = ABC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="younge"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/Columnists/Column/0,,2170644,00.html | title = Apart from the noose, this is an everyday story of modern America | date = September 17, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | last = Younge | first = Gary | newspaper = The Guardian | location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="page"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/09/injustice_is_bigger_than_jena.html | title = Injustice is bigger than the 'Jena 6' | date = September 25, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-09-27 | last = Page | first = Clarence | authorlink = Clarence Page | publisher = The Baltimore Sun via RealClearPolitics }}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing the same statistics, syndicated columnist [[Clarence Page]] wrote that "The best legacy for the Jena March 6&amp;nbsp;would be a new movement, dedicated this time to the reduction and elimination of unequal justice wherever it appears. I don't care who leads it, but it shouldn't be for blacks only".&lt;ref name="page" /&gt; Writing in the ''[[New York Times]]'', Professor [[Orlando Patterson]] of [[Harvard University]] used the case to highlight the use of the prison system as a means of "controlling young black men", which is one factor in a broader "crisis in relations between men and women of all classes and, as a result, the catastrophic state of black family life".&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=/2007/09/30/opinion/30patterson.html | title = Jena, O.J., and the jailing of Black America | date = September 30, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | last = Patterson | first = Orlando | authorlink = Orlando Patterson | newspaper = The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other columnists have argued that inaccuracies in the media coverage unfairly tarnish the town and have led to a national overreaction, part of the tendency in the 24-hour news cycle. ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'' columnist Heather MacDonald, while condemning the noose hangings as a "despicable provocation", said that "the media, the (race) advocates and pandering politicians have erupted in an outpouring of seeming joy at the alleged proof that America remains a racist country".&lt;ref name="macdonald"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mac Donald |first=Heather |authorlink=Heather Mac Donald |date=September 30, 2007 |title=Don't make Jena out to be more than it is |newspaper=The Dallas Morning News |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/points/stories/DN-macdonald_30edi.ART.State.Edition1.4257c86.html |accessdate=2008-02-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315020726/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/points/stories/DN-macdonald_30edi.ART.State.Edition1.4257c86.html |archivedate=March 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a column in the ''[[Kansas City Star]]'', [[Jason Whitlock]] drew attention to what he called factual inaccuracies in reporting of the story. He focused on the piece circulated by Bean to news outlets, "Bean's story is framed—by his own admission—as an indictment of the criminal justice system and the people in power in Jena and, therefore, the story is unfairly biased".&lt;ref name="whitlock" /&gt; Craig Franklin, assistant editor of ''The Jena Times'', who says that he is the only writer to have covered this story from its inception, wrote in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]],'' "I have never before witnessed such a disgrace in professional journalism. Myths replaced facts&amp;nbsp;... the truth about Jena will eventually be known".&lt;ref name="MediaMyths" /&gt;

== Public response ==
The case provoked reactions that the charges against the Jena Six were disproportionate and racially motivated. Supporters of the Jena Six circulated online petitions, raised money for legal defense, and held a demonstration in Jena on September 20, 2007.

=== Artistic tributes ===
Several songs have been produced in response to the Jena Six case. [[John Mellencamp]] released a song and video called "Jena", with lyrics such as "Jena, take your nooses down" which gained considerable media attention, and which Mellencamp described as a "condemnation of racism".&lt;ref name="mellencamp"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,299824,00.html | title = Louisiana mayor balks at Mellencamp 'Jena 6' protest song and video | accessdate = 2008-09-02 | date = October 6, 2007 | publisher = Associated Press via Foxnews | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090125153714/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,299824,00.html | archive-date = 2009-01-25 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The video juxtaposes images of Jena, the high school, and the tree with video from the 1960s, including civil rights marchers and police beatings. Video of [[John F.

"[[Blood at the Root]]" is a play written by Dominique Morisseau about the Jena 6. Blood at the Root premiered on March 28, 2014 at Penn State Center Stage. The story is told through the lens of one of the Jena 6's sister, who also attended the high school. The audience is able to experience the series of events that led up to the convictions from multiple students' unique perspective. It has toured internationally and has been described as "catalyzing conversations on difficult and essential questions of race and justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brantley|first1=Ben|title='Blood at the Root' Draws Inspiration From the Jena Six Case in Louisiana|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/theater/blood-at-the-root-draws-inspiration-from-the-jena-six-case-in-louisiana.html?mcubz=3&amp;_r=0|accessdate=1 September 2017|publisher=New York TimesBr|date=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jena Six petition.JPG|thumb|upright|An activist for [[A.N.S.W.E.R.]] gathers petition signatures at a [[Los Angeles]] rally, October 2007.]]

Many online petitions have circulated calling for various actions in response to the Jena Six case. Online advocacy group [[Color of Change]], which had previously advocated for victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]], called for District Attorney Walters to drop all charges and for Governor [[Kathleen Blanco]] to investigate his conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorofchange.org/jena/main.html |title=Justice for the Jena 6 |accessdate=2007-10-18 |author=Color of Change |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011001120/http://www.colorofchange.org/jena/main.html |archivedate=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Color of Change raised more than $212,000 for the Jena Six legal defense, largely through online donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Joe | last = Garofoli | title = Louisiana's Jena Six beating case galvanizes S.F.'s 'black MoveOn' | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/09/22/MNEISAVOE.DTL | newspaper = San Francisco Chronicle | date = September 22, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secure.colorofchange.org/jena_fund/info.html |title=How funds are managed |author=Color of Change |accessdate=2008-02-08 |publisher=Color of Change }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the NAACP provided a link to the fund through its website, initially, the donation link on the NAACP Jena Six support page steered potential donors to the generic NAACP donation page, with no way to designate funds for the Jena Six. Black bloggers objected, and several days later, the link was altered to reach the defense fund.&lt;ref name="blogs help drive"&gt;{{cite news | first = Howard | last = Witt | title = Blogs help drive Jena protest | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-jena_blog_web19,0,1970628.story | newspaper = Chicago Tribune | location = Jena, Louisiana | date = September 18, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] represented Beard, hired local defense counsel to represent Bailey, and helped coordinate the overall defense strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Scott | last = Michels | title = Civil Rights Leaders Urge Action in Racially Charged La.

In the months following the Jena Six rally, controversy arose about accounting and dispersal of the legal defense funds. Questions about the money were first sparked by photos posted on Robert Bailey's former [[MySpace]] account, which show him with quantities of hundred dollar bills stuffed in his mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990074 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130204053218/http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990074 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 4, 2013 |title='Jena Six' notebook |accessdate=2007-11-10 |date=September 28, 2007 |newspaper=The Town Talk }}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy expanded when radio host [[Michael Baisden]] accused Color of Change of being "shady" with their use of the funds. Color of Change responded to the accusations by posting links to canceled checks on their web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorofchange.org/jena/baisden/ |title=False allegations on the Michael Baisden Show |accessdate=2008-02-08 |publisher=Color of Change |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302202444/http://www.colorofchange.org/jena/baisden/ |archivedate=2008-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his November 10 report, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' correspondent Howard Witt noted that Color of Change was the only national civil rights group to be fully transparent with their use of the funds.&lt;ref name="funds controversy"&gt;{{cite news | first = Howard | last = Witt | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-jena_bdnov11,1,5899685.story | title = Controversy over the Jena 6 funds | date = November 11, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-02 | newspaper = Chicago Tribune }}&lt;/ref&gt; But Witt raised broader questions about the funds, which totaled more than half a million dollars. He reported that attorneys for Bell claimed that they have yet to receive any money from him, and that the six families had refused to publicly account for the donations.&lt;ref name="funds controversy" /&gt;

On September 22, 2007, the [[FBI]] opened an investigation of a [[white supremacist]] website that listed the addresses of five of the Jena Six and the telephone numbers of some of their families "in case anyone wants to deliver justice". An FBI spokeswoman said the agency believed that the website "essentially called for their [[lynching]]".&lt;ref name="FBIprobe" /&gt; Civil rights advocate [[Al Sharpton]] has said that some of the families have continually received threatening and harassing phone calls.&lt;ref name="FBIprobe"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/22/AR2007092201404.html?nav=rss_technology | title = FBI probes anti-Jena 6 Web page | accessdate = 2007-09-25 | date = September 22, 2007 | last = Bohrer | first = Becky | agency = Associated Press | work = The Washington Post | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121106135112/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/22/AR2007092201404.html?nav=rss_technology | archivedate = November 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later developments ==
On September 25, 2007, Representative [[John Conyers]] (D), Chairman of the [[House Judiciary Committee]], announced that he would hold congressional hearings on what he described as "the miscarriages of justice that have occurred in Jena, Louisiana", with the goal of pressuring the [[United States Department of Justice]] into taking action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/25/AR2007092501666.html | title = Lawmakers Seek Jena 6 Teen's Release | date = September 25, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | publisher = Associated Press via The Washington Post | last = Barrett | first = Devlin }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing took place on October 16, 2007; Washington and Sharpton, among others, testified. Walters was invited to testify but declined. Most Republican members of the committee declined to attend. Representative [[Sheila Jackson Lee]] (D-Texas) said to Washington and other Justice Department officials, "Shame on you. ... As a parent, I'm on the verge of tears,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-10-16-650507891_x.htm | title = Lawmakers Seek US Action in Jena 6 Case | newspaper = USA Today | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | date = October 16, 2007 | last = Barrett | first = Devlin }}&lt;/ref&gt; and said, "I want to know what you're going to do to get Mychal Bell out of jail!"&lt;!--emphasis was in original--&gt;&lt;ref name="darryl"&gt;{{cite news | first = Darryl | last = Fears | title = U.S. Attorney Calls Noose Display 'Hate Crime,' Explains Lack of Charges | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/16/AR2007101600200.html | newspaper = The Washington Post | date = October 17, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; US Attorney Washington responded that the federal government had a limited role to play in the matter.&lt;ref name="darryl" /&gt;

Representative Lee and other members of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] called upon outgoing Louisiana Governor Blanco to [[pardon]] the Jena Six on December 19, 2007, stating that "we believe Mychal Bell and the Jena 6 have paid a sufficient debt to society for any transgressions they may have committed".&lt;ref name="pardonme" /&gt; Blanco's office responded that she cannot grant pardons without a recommendation from the state Pardon Board, and no meeting of that body was scheduled during her remaining term of office. Walters commented that Representative Lee's "passion for racial equality is admirable, but her grasp of the facts is not".&lt;ref name="pardonme" /&gt; He indicated that the attack on Barker was not just a schoolyard fight "but rather an unprovoked, unforeseen assault on a young man who had nothing to do with the hanging of the nooses".&lt;ref name="pardonme"&gt;{{cite news | title = Black congressional members seek pardon for 'Jena Six'  |agency=Associated Press | date = December 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Blanco's term of office ended without any pardons being granted.

On July 31, 2007, the school had the controversial tree cut down.&lt;ref name="wapo" /&gt; School Board member Fowler said, "There's nothing positive about that old tree. It's all negative. And I'm serving on the new School Board, and we're wanting to start fresh on some things".&lt;ref name="cutdown"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990005 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090717105743/http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F99999999%2FNEWS%2F399990005 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 17, 2009 |title=Jena High 'noose' tree cut down |date=July 31, 2008 |newspaper=The Town Talk |accessdate=2008-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fowler, the tree would have had to have been cut down to make way for the rebuilding of the school after the fire. Others thought that taking down the tree was not an effective way to address any problems of racism in Jena. "Cutting down that beautiful tree won't solve the problem at hand," said Caseptla Bailey, Robert Bailey's mother. "It still happened".&lt;ref name="cutdown" /&gt;  The remains of the building have been cleared, and a bid accepted for the reconstruction.

Jones and Purvis attended the [[BET Hip Hop Awards]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] on October 13, 2007, and were invited to present the award for [[BET Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=/www/story/10-15-2007/0004682354 | title = Kanye West, Nelly, Common, Dr. Cornel West, MC Lyte, David Banner, Dr. Michael Eric Dyson, Lil' Wayne, Soulja Boy and Hurricane Chris, Among Others, Brought Style, Substance and Swagger to the BET HIP HOP AWARDS 2007 | accessdate = 2007-10-18 | publisher = PR Newswire/BET Networks }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the two defendants came out on stage, they were greeted by a standing ovation.

Justin Barker and his parents filed a civil suit on November 29, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/12/04/national/main3575112.shtml?source=RSSattr=U.S._3575112 | title = Victim in Jena Six case files suit | publisher = Associated Press via CBS News | date = December 4, 2007 | accessdate = 2007-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; against the parents of those accused of beating him, the adult members of the Jena Six (as of the time of the attack), an additional student named Malcolm Shaw, and the LaSalle Parish School Board.&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-12-04-jena-six_N.htm?csp=34 | title = Beating victim's family sues in 'Jena Six' case | date = December 4, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-08-23 | work = USA Today }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barker's medical bills from his emergency room visit totaled more than $5,000.&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt; The lawsuit alleges that the LaSalle Parish School Board inadequately supervised students and failed to maintain discipline.&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt; The Barkers also allege that the school board did not implement a plan to "discourage the dangerous activity of threatening and attacking other students while in possession of actual knowledge of said threats and prior attacks while the students are on school grounds".&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt;

The case was on hold pending resolution of the criminal cases. When the Barkers' attorney learned that Jesse Ray Beard was using defense funds (which might be garnished under a civil suit) to pay for private school, he decided to push ahead with the case. Following a motion by Bell's civil attorney to recuse Mauffray in the civil case, proceedings were put on hold again pending appointment of a judge to hear that recusal motion.&lt;ref name="on hold"&gt;{{cite news |author=Abbey Brown | title = Jena Six cases linger more than a year later |date = September 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mauffray subsequently retired.

In February 2007, Jesse Ray Beard was charged with, and subsequently convicted of and sentenced for, simple battery, simple criminal damage to property less than $500, and simple assault. He received a suspended sentence of incarceration, and was placed on house arrest.&lt;ref name="charges"&gt;{{cite news|title=Louisiana youth getting a break|work=New Milford Times|date=August 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 9, 2008, Beard, by then aged 17, was released from house arrest so that he could attend a summer program and football camp in [[New York (state)|New York]]. It was revealed at a hearing on that date that Beard had been recommended for expulsion for 13 disciplinary actions, but that the recommendation had been overturned. In New York, he stayed with Alan Howard, a local attorney who represented Beard in the civil suit, and worked as an intern in the attorney's office, while taking summer courses to prepare him for junior year.&lt;ref name= newlife/&gt; He was required to return to Jena by August 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Jena Six' defendant removed from house arrest|work=The Town Talk|date=July 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
