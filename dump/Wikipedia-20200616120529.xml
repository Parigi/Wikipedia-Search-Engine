'''''Justified''''' is the debut solo [[studio album]] by American singer [[Justin Timberlake]]. It was released on November 5, 2002 by [[Jive Records]]. The album was written and recorded in a six-week period, during the hiatus of Timberlake's band [[NSYNC]]. For the album, Timberlake began to adopt a more mature image as an [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] artist opposed to the previous [[pop music]] recorded by the group. The majority of the album was produced by [[The Neptunes]] (credited as "[[Pharrell Williams|Williams]] and [[Chad Hugo|Hugo]]") and [[Timbaland]], and features guest appearances by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Clipse]], and [[Bubba Sparxxx]].
Primarily an R&amp;B album, ''Justified'' also contains influences of [[dance-pop]], [[funk music|funk]], and [[soul music]].

''Justified'' received generally positive reviews from critics, who complimented the mature progression of Timberlake’s material, although some criticized its lyrical content. The album earned Timberlake four [[2004 Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nominations, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], and won the award for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]]. ''Justified'' debuted at number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and sold 439,000 copies in its first week. It was certified three-times platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), having sold over 3.9 million copies in the US. As of 2012, the album has sold over ten million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name="justifiedwwsales"/&gt;

Four singles were released from ''Justified''. The lead single "[[Like I Love You]]" peaked at number 11 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], while the follow-up singles "[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]" and "[[Rock Your Body]]" peaked within the top five on the chart. "Like I Love You", "Cry Me a River", and "Rock Your Body" peaked at number two in the [[UK Singles Chart|United Kingdom]] and in the top ten in [[ARIA Charts|Australia]] (with "Rock Your Body" topping the Australian chart), [[Ireland Singles Chart|Ireland]], [[MegaCharts|Netherlands]], and [[Ultratop 50|Belgium]]. To promote the album, Timberlake performed on several television shows and award ceremonies, including the [[2002 MTV Video Music Awards]], where he made his solo debut appearance. Furthermore, Timberlake embarked on two concert tours: ''[[The Justified World Tour]]'' and the ''[[Justified and Stripped Tour]]''; on the latter, he was accompanied by [[Christina Aguilera]].

==Background==
Following the conclusion of their [[Celebrity Tour]] in 2002, [[boy band]] [[NSYNC]] went on a hiatus, during which lead singer [[Justin Timberlake]] started working on his debut solo album.&lt;ref name="mtv5"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1457770/janet-gets-sexy-on-justin-cd.jhtml|title=Timberlake, Janet Jackson Make Sexy Pair On ''Justified''|last=Wiederhorn|first=Jon|date=September 25, 2002|publisher=MTV News. Viacom|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the album, he wanted to portray a more mature image as an [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] performer, rather than a boy band pop artist.&lt;ref name="mtv5"/&gt; He revealed minimal information regarding the producers and artists involved with ''Justified'' during its early recording stage,&lt;ref name="mtv"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1456207/timberlake-solo-lp-tightly-guarded.jhtml|title=Justin Timberlake Working 'NSecret On Star-Packed Solo LP|last=Moss|first=Corey|date=July 23, 2002|publisher=[[MTV News]]. [[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]]|accessdate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his management and record label also reluctant to share any information.&lt;ref name="mtv"/&gt; However, [[MTV News]] reported that production duo [[The Neptunes]] were working on multiple tracks, while rapper [[Sean Combs|P. Diddy]] and singer [[Mario Winans]] contributed to one track.&lt;ref name="mtv"/&gt; Other known producers involved included [[Mike City]], [[Raphael Saadiq]] and [[Rodney Jerkins]], though between June and July, none of the aforementioned producers had attended any studio sessions.&lt;ref name="mtv"/&gt; Explaining his involvement with the project, Jerkins said at the [[BET Awards|2002 BET Awards]] that he "just got a call about working on the project" and that whenever Timberlake wanted his assistance, it would "be done".&lt;ref name="mtv"/&gt;

[[Brian McKnight]]'s manager stated that his client had already recorded tracks with the singer, while rapper [[Nelly (entertainer)|Nelly]] explained to the reporters that both him and Timberlake had discussed a collaboration effort.&lt;ref name="mtv"/&gt; Early in 2002, [[Angie Stone]] revealed that Timberlake "loves the ''[[Mahogany Soul]]'' album" with him further saying to her "your CD's in my car right now, you have to work on my solo project".&lt;ref name="mtv"/&gt; These assertions were later partially denied by a [[Jive Records|Jive]] spokesperson who announced that the material produced from the collaboration would not appear on the finalized record.&lt;ref name="mtv1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1457095/timberlake-sets-vmas-solo-debut.jhtml|title=Justin Timberlake To Play VMAs, Says Solo Debut Is 'Very Me'|last=D'Angelo|first=Joe|date=August 20, 2002|publisher=MTV News.

==Recording==
{{Quote box|quoted=true|salign=right|width=30%|align=right|We picked him up right after he checked into his hotel. We drove around in the car listening to old Earth, Wind &amp; Fire albums, and he was totally with it. The background of those songs is the feeling we wanted to incorporate into the music. He was like, 'Nobody's ever heard anything like that before ... a white boy singing this kind of music.' He didn't care what people would say.|source=—Chad Hugo, [[MTV News]]&lt;ref name="mtv3"/&gt;}}

''Justified'' was written and recorded in a six-week period. According to Timberlake, the "creative spurt" was reminiscent of "that period of time back in the 1960s and '70s when musicians got together and just jammed and worked out of inspiration. There was no heavy calculation or belaboring songs and mixes. Everything flowed pretty easily and naturally."&lt;ref name="Justin Timberlake In Sync"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73696/justin-timberlake-in-sync-with-60s-on-solo-debut|title=Justin Timberlake In Sync With '60s On Solo Debut|website=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recording sessions took place at various studios in the United States, including the [[Westlake Recording Studios]] in Los Angeles, Manhattan Center Studios in New York City and Master Sound Recording Studios and Windmark Recording in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]].&lt;ref name="Notes"&gt;{{cite AV media notes|others=Justin Timberlake|title=Justified|year=2002|type= inlay cover|publisher= [[Jive Records]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neptunes told MTV News that the duo and Timberlake drove in a car listening to [[Earth, Wind &amp; Fire]] albums for inspiration, with the background of the band's music being what the production duo wanted to implement into ''Justified''{{'s}} musical content.&lt;ref name="mtv3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1457175/preview-timberlake-album.jhtml|title=Preview Of Justin Timberlake Album From Neptunes' Hugo|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=August 26, 2002|publisher=MTV News. Viacom|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production duo commented that despite not being content with sampling music, for inspiration, they also listened to both ''[[Off the Wall (album)|Off the Wall]]'' (1979) and ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' (1982), albums by [[Michael Jackson]].&lt;ref name="mtv3"/&gt; Their intentions were to create music that was similar to Jackson's work without "recycling them".&lt;ref name="mtv3"/&gt; One of the two members of The Neptunes, Chad Hugo, commented that they just wanted to re-create "that sense of those timeless, classic songs, without any of the 'bling, bling, hit me on my two-way' style of the new R&amp;B. It has elements of the old and the new."&lt;ref name="mtv3"/&gt; The producer further went on to say that people wanted Timberlake to be conformed to being part of boy band NSYNC, with the former insisting that the singer is an immaculate vocalist.&lt;ref name="mtv3"/&gt; Hugo acknowledged Timberlake's break-up with singer [[Britney Spears]], saying that some of the album's music could be directed towards it.&lt;ref name="mtv3"/&gt;
