"'''Filthy'''" is a song by American singer-songwriter [[Justin Timberlake]]. It was released on January 5, 2018, as the [[lead single]] from his fifth studio album, ''[[Man of the Woods]]'' (2018). The [[Electro (music)|electro-funk]] song was written and produced by Timberlake, [[Timbaland]], and [[Danja (record producer)|Danja]], with additional songwriting from [[James Fauntleroy]] and [[1500 or Nothin'|Larrance Dopson]].&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite news|last=Aswad|first=Jem|title=Justin Timberlake to Drop Four Videos Before 'Man of the Woods' Album Release|url=https://variety.com/2018/music/news/justin-timberlake-to-drop-four-videos-before-man-of-the-woods-album-release-1202652093/|accessdate=January 4, 2018|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its music video was released on same day, which is set at a futuristic technology conference and shows Timberlake staging a [[Proof of concept|proof-of-concept]] demo for a robot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/justin-timberlake-releases-filthy-music-video|title=Justin Timberlake Releases "Filthy" Music Video|last=Merrill|first=Philip|date=January 5, 2018|work=Grammys|accessdate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was serviced to [[contemporary hit radio]] on January 9, 2018. "Filthy" debuted at number 9 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Timberlake's 18th top 10 on the chart as a soloist,&lt;ref name="hot100"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8094379/ed-sheeran-bruno-mars-cardi-b-justin-timberlake-hot-100-top-10|title=Ed Sheeran's 'Perfect' Rules Hot 100, Bruno Mars &amp; Cardi B's 'Finesse' Flies to No. 3 &amp; Justin Timberlake's 'Filthy' Debuts at No. 9|last=Trust|first=Gary|date=January 16, 2018|work=Billboard|accessdate=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reached the top 5 in Canada.

==Production==
"Filthy" was revealed as the first single the day after ''Man of the Woods'' was confirmed. Timberlake, Timbaland and Danja first collaborated on ''[[FutureSex/LoveSounds]]''. All three artists co-wrote the song along with [[James Fauntleroy]], who co-wrote all songs on ''[[The 20/20 Experience]]'' and all but two songs on ''[[The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2]]'' and [[1500 or Nothin'|Larrance Dopson]] of production team [[1500 or Nothin']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Timbaland and Danja Produced Justin Timberlake's New Song "Filthy"|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/01/timbaland-danja-produced-justin-timberlake-filthy-new-song/|accessdate=January 4, 2018|work=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|first=Peter A.|last=Berry|date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"I like to think of "Filthy" as the disruption between the world we're living in and his world. The world that he's living in with his family, his friends that he came up with, his musical roots and everything. We're gonna go into, easily, the other type of feelings and vibes of his album that were kind of presented in the trailer... [It] is the kind of in-between thing, that jump-off thing that kinda wipes the palette clean for him to be able to tell the story that he wants to tell. I can't say that "Filthy" was described in the trailer, but "Filthy" played its role in the whole album."|Danja in a conversation with ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' on why "Filthy" opens ''Man of the Woods''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.complex.com/music/2018/01/danja-interview-justin-timberlake-filthy-man-of-the-woods |title=Producer Danja Explains Why Justin Timberlake's "Filthy" Doesn't Sound Like A Country Song |last=Tharpe |first=Frazier |date=January 7, 2018 |work=Complex |access-date=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Recording for "Filthy" was handled by Danja and Timbaland. The duo worked on the song in a separate studio, while Timberlake worked between two other studios, which had [[Chad Hugo]] and [[Pharrell Williams]] of [[The Neptunes]] in one room, and [[Rob Knox (producer)|Rob Knox]] of [[The Y's]] and [[Eric Hudson]] in the other. Timberlake would compose certain sections of the song in his head, as he did in the ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' sessions as well. Danja added screams, moans and breaths into the song, as well as the sound of a lion roaring. While the breakdown was conceptualised by Timberlake - Timbaland and Danja would create the breakdown as Timberlake would sing the melody. Danja also experimented with the idea of [[hi-hats]] in the song but felt that they didn't "...feel right. It dates it, puts it into a place of what's happening right now. That's not where you want to be."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/justin-timberlake-producer-danja-talks-filthy-w515205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

==Critical reception==
''[[The Guardian]]'' journalist Ben Beaumont-Thomas gave the song five-out-of-five stars, and said in his review, "On the basis of Filthy, he absolutely can. Beginning with some bombastic guitar rock, it transmogrifies into a beautifully dark, undulating funk track underpinned by a whiplash bass womp". He described the song as a "grownup funk masterpiece," and added "the chorus, which modulates into a sweeter, smoother key, is signature Timberlake."&lt;ref name="the guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jan/05/justin-timberlake-filthy-review?CMP=share_btn_tw|title=Justin Timberlake: Filthy review – comeback single channels Prince into grownup funk masterpiece|last=Beaumont-Thomas|first=Ben|date=January 5, 2017|work=The Guardian|accessdate=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'', C. Vernon Coleman II stated the production provides a "fitting soundscape for the single, as they deploy out of this world synths with pulsating [[Roland TR-808|808s]]."&lt;ref name="xxl"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2018/01/timbaland-danja-justin-timberlake-filthy/|title=Timberlake, Timbaland and Danja Reunite In New Track 'Filthy'|date=January 5, 2018|work=XXL|accessdate=January 5, 2018|first=C. Vernon|last=Coleman II}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[NME]]'', Larry Barleet reacted positively, stating "Timberlake pulls it off," and adding "what's really brilliant about 'Filthy' is that it's proof that JT isn't done with innovating."&lt;ref name="nme"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/justin-timberlake-filthy-track-review-2206682|title=In search of the filth in Justin Timberlake's 'Filthy'|last=Larry|first=Barleet|date=January 5, 2017|work=NME|accessdate=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also from ''NME'', Nick Reily described the track as "futuristic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/justin-timberlake-returns-new-single-filthy-2206657|title=Justin Timberlake returns with futuristic new single 'Filthy'|last=Reily|first=Nick|date=January 5, 2018|work=NME|accessdate=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rap-Up]]'' opined the "dance-ready" track finds the team experimenting with "a new futuristic sound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2018/01/04/new-music-justin-timberlake-filthy/|title=New Music: Justin Timberlake - Filthy|date=January 5, 2018|work=Rap-Up|accessdate=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher R. Weingarten of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said it is "hard" to call the song pop "since the production is so [[avant-garde]]." He further commented the producers Timbaland and Danja "conjure a testosterone electronic chainsaw grind and match it with vintage [[Larry Graham]]-style slap bass: The fact that the two musical elements don't exactly match groovewise creates a beautiful and disorienting tension unlike anything on the radio."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/justin-timberlakes-man-of-the-woods-album-review-w516240 |title=Review: Justin Timberlake Heads for the Country (Sort of) on 'Man of the Woods' |last=Weingarten |first=Christopher R.  |date=February 2, 2018 |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ed Masley of ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' described it as a "suitably robotic, an electro-funk sex jam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/01/04/best-january-singles-playlist-2018-new-music/1006475001/|title=Justin Timberlake just dropped the video to 'Filthy' from 'Man of the Woods'|last=Masley|first=Ed|date=January 4, 2018|work=The Arizona Central|accessdate=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Willman of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' thought the single and visuals in the context of the album may represent Timberlake's former self "albeit one who's clearly still capable of coming to the phone, still getting his sexy-back kicks in before the muse draws him into a more reflective forest."&lt;ref name="variety review"/&gt; In ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Katie Atkinson ranked it 11 among all Timberlake's singles, and felt "the funky Timbaland beat and [[tongue-in-cheek]] lyrics were a welcome, loose surprise."&lt;ref name="billboard"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7357881/justin-timberlake-singles-ranked |title=Every Justin Timberlake Single Ranked: Critic's Choice |last=Atkinson |first=Katie |date=January 5, 2017 |work=Billboard |access-date=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jon Caramanica]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' opined it is an "unimaginative but slyly effective electro-funk vamp with [[acid house]] accents...
