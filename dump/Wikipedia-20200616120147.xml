{{History of Iceland}}
The '''Icelandic financial crisis''' was a major [[financial crisis|economic]] and political event in [[Iceland]] that involved the [[default (finance)|default]] of all three of the country's major privately owned [[commercial bank]]s in late 2008, following their difficulties in [[refinancing]] their [[current liability|short-term debt]] and a [[bank run|run on deposits]] in the [[Netherlands]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Relative to the size of its economy, Iceland's systemic banking collapse was the largest experienced by any country in economic history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12762027|title=Cracks in the crust|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=[[The Economist]]|date=11 December 2008|accessdate=4 February 2013}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis led to a severe [[economic depression]] in 2008–2010 and [[2009 Icelandic financial crisis protests|significant political unrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2015/cr1573.pdf|title=Iceland. Selected issues.|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|date=March 2015|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years preceding the crisis, three Icelandic banks, [[Kaupthing]], [[Landsbanki]] and [[Glitnir (bank)|Glitnir]], multiplied in size. This expansion was driven by ready access to credit in international financial markets, in particular [[money market]]s. As the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]] unfolded, investors perceived the Icelandic banks to be increasingly risky. Trust in the banks gradually faded, leading to a sharp depreciation of the [[Icelandic króna]] in 2008 and increased difficulties for the banks in rolling over their short-term debt. At the end of the second quarter of 2008, Iceland's [[external debt]] was 9.553 trillion [[Icelandic krónur]] (€50 billion), more than 7 times the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of Iceland in 2007.&lt;ref name="debt"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sedlabanki.is/?pageid=552&amp;itemid=a55be3a0-9943-484e-a8de-46d23f17ba25&amp;nextday=4&amp;nextmonth=12|publisher =[[Central Bank of Iceland]]|date = 4 September 2008|title = External debt|accessdate = 11 October 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081021220411/http://www.sedlabanki.is/?pageid=552&amp;itemid=a55be3a0-9943-484e-a8de-46d23f17ba25&amp;nextday=4&amp;nextmonth=12|archivedate = 21 October 2008|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GDP"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.statice.is/?PageID=444&amp;newsid=2950&amp;highlight=Gross%20Domestic%20Product%202007|website =Statistics Iceland|date = 11 September 2008|title = Gross domestic product 2007– Revision|accessdate = 13 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assets of the three banks totaled 14.437 trillion krónur at the end of the second quarter 2008,&lt;ref&gt;Glitnir ISK 3,863 bn {{Cite web |url=http://www.glitnirbank.com/servlet/file/2quarter_2008.pdf?ITEM_ENT_ID=11447&amp;COLLSPEC_ENT_ID=156 |title=Interim Financial Statement 2008Q2 |publisher=[[Glitnir (bank)|Glitnir]]|format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205091126/http://www.glitnirbank.com/servlet/file/2quarter_2008.pdf?ITEM_ENT_ID=11447&amp;COLLSPEC_ENT_ID=156 |archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=dead |access-date=16 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}; Landsbanki ISK 3,970 bn {{cite web|url=http://www.landsbanki.is/Uploads/Documents/ArsskyrslurOgUppgjor/landsbanki_consolidated_interim_financial_statements_30-jun-2008.pdf|title=Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements:1 January - 30 June 2008|publisher=[[Landsbanki]]|access-date=November 7, 2019}}; Kaupthing ISK 6,604 bn {{cite web|url=http://www.kaupthing.com/lisalib/getfile.aspx?itemid=17006|title=Interim Financial Statement 2008Q2|publisher=[[Kaupthing]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114164038/http://www.kaupthing.com/lisalib/getfile.aspx?itemid=17006|archivedate=November 14, 2008|date=November 14, 2008|url-status=dead|format=PDF}}. The borrowings of the three banks at the same date were: Glitnir ISK 2,242 bn; Landsbanki ISK 1,220 bn; Kaupthing ISK 2,883 bn.&lt;/ref&gt; equal to more than 11 times the national GDP. Due to the huge size of the Icelandic financial system in comparison with the Icelandic economy, the [[Central Bank of Iceland]] found itself unable to act as a lender of last resort during the crisis, further aggravating the mistrust in the banking system.

On 29 September 2008, it was announced that [[Glitnir (bank)|Glitnir]] would be nationalised. However, subsequent efforts to restore faith in the banking system failed. On 6 October, the [[Althing|Icelandic legislature]] instituted an [[emergency law]] which enabled the [[Financial Supervisory Authority (Iceland)|Financial Supervisory Authority]] (FME) to take control over financial institutions and made domestic [[deposits]] in the banks priority claims. In the following days, new banks were founded to take over the domestic operations of Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir. The old banks were put into [[receivership]] and liquidation, resulting in losses for their [[shareholder]]s and foreign [[creditor]]s. Outside Iceland, more than half a million depositors lost access to their accounts in foreign branches of Icelandic banks. This led to the 2008–2013 [[Icesave dispute]], that ended with an [[EFTA Court]] ruling that Iceland was not obliged to repay Dutch and British depositors minimum [[deposit insurance|deposit guarantees]].

In an effort to stabilize the situation, the Icelandic government stated that all domestic deposits in Icelandic banks would be guaranteed, imposed strict [[capital controls]] to stabilize the value of the Icelandic króna, and secured a US$5.1bn sovereign debt package from the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and the [[Nordic countries]] in order to finance a [[budget deficit]] and the restoration of the banking system. The international bailout support programme led by IMF officially ended on 31 August 2011, while the capital controls which were imposed in November 2008 were lifted on 14 March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/business/iceland-economy-finance-capital-controls.html?_r=0 | title=Iceland, Symbol of Financial Crisis, Finally Lifts Capital Controls| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| date=March 14, 2017|access-date=November 7, 2019| last1=Alderman| first1=Liz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The financial crisis had a serious negative impact on the [[Economy of Iceland|Icelandic economy]]. The national currency fell sharply in value, foreign currency transactions were virtually suspended for weeks, and the [[market capitalisation]] of the Icelandic stock exchange fell by more than 90%. As a result of the crisis, Iceland underwent a severe economic depression; the country's [[gross domestic product]] dropped by 10% in real terms between the third quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2010.&lt;ref name="STATICE"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Seasonally adjusted quarterly volume growth in GDP 1980–2014|url = http://www.statice.is/?PageID=1267&amp;src=https://rannsokn.hagstofa.is/pxen/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=THJ01703%26ti=Seasonally+adjusted+quarterly+volume+growth+in+GDP+1980-2014%26path=../Database/thjodhagsreikningar/landsframleidsla_althj/%26lang=1%26units=Percent|publisher = Statistics Iceland|accessdate = 9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new era with positive GDP growth started in 2011, and has helped foster a gradually declining trend for the unemployment rate.

On 21 October, the Central Bank of Iceland asked the remaining independent financial institutions for new [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] against their loans.

The Icelandic bank had acted as an agent for Eksportfinans, administering loans to several companies: however Eksportfinans alleges that, when the loans were paid off early by borrowers, Glitnir kept the cash and merely continued with the regular payments to Eksportfinans, effectively taking an unauthorized loan itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Aftenposten |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2727423.ece |date=24 October 2008 |accessdate=24 October 2008 |title=Norway sends aid team to crisis-hit Iceland |author=Berglund, Nina |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024033357/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2727423.ece |archivedate=24 October 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming from a small domestic market, Iceland's banks have [[corporate finance|financed]] their expansion with loans on the [[interbank lending market]] and, more recently, by [[deposit account|deposits]] from outside Iceland (which are also a form of external debt). Households also took on a large amount of debt, equivalent to 213% of [[disposable income]], which led to inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Kreppanomics|work=The Economist|date = 9 October 2008|accessdate = 10 October 2008|url = http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12382011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081012020021/http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12382011|archivedate= 12 October 2008 |url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inflation was exacerbated by the practice of the Central Bank of Iceland issuing liquidity loans to banks on the basis of newly issued, uncovered bonds&lt;ref&gt;Para. 19, [http://www.forsaetisraduneyti.is/media/Skyrslur/LOI.pdf "Letter of Intent to the International Monetary Fund"] (PDF). 3 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; – effectively, printing money on demand.

In response to the rise in prices – 14% in the twelve months to September 2008,&lt;ref name="CBI-EI"/&gt; compared with a target of 2.5% – the Central Bank of Iceland held [[interest rate]]s high (15.5%).&lt;ref name="CBI-MB"/&gt; Such high interest rates, compared with 5.5% in the United Kingdom or 4% in the [[eurozone]] for example, encouraged overseas investors to hold deposits in Icelandic krónur, leading to [[monetary inflation]]: the Icelandic [[money supply]] (M3) grew 56.5% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with 5.0% GDP growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sedlabanki.is/lisalib/getfile.aspx?itemid=6628|title=Economic Indicators|format=PDF|publisher= Central Bank of Iceland|website=|date=November 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218013836/http://sedlabanki.is/lisalib/getfile.aspx?itemid=6628|archivedate=18 December 2010|accessdate= 4 February 2013}} GDP growth is for the second quarter 2008 (annualised); Q3 growth was −0.8% (annualised).&lt;/ref&gt; The situation was effectively an [[economic bubble]], with investors overestimating the true value of the króna.

As with many banks around the world, the Icelandic banks found it increasingly difficult or impossible to roll over their loans in the [[interbank market]], their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh loans. In such a situation, a bank would normally have to ask for a loan from the [[central bank]] as the [[lender of last resort]]. However, in Iceland the banks were so much larger than the national economy that the Central Bank of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks.&lt;ref name="bbc.1"&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Icesave.png|thumb|The Icesave logo, advertising it as "part of Landsbanki, Reykjavík, Iceland"]]
The situation was made worse by the fact that Icesave was operating as a branch of Landsbanki, rather than as a legally independent subsidiary. As such, it was completely dependent on the Central Bank of Iceland for emergency loans of [[liquidity]], and could not turn to the Bank of England for help. The UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) was aware of the risk, and was considering imposing special liquidity requirements on Icelandic deposit-taking banks in the weeks before the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Lawyers head to Iceland to get cash back|work=The Independent|location=London|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/lawyers-head-to-iceland-to-get-cash-back-958345.html|author1=Leftly, Mark |author2=Northedge, Richard |date = 12 October 2008|accessdate = 15 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the plan – which was never implemented – would have forced the Icelandic banks to cut interest rates or stop taking new deposits, and might even have sparked the sort of bank run it was designed to prevent. The Guernsey authorities were also planning on bringing in restrictions on foreign banks operating as branches and on transfers of funds between Guernsey subsidiaries and parent banks ("parental upstreaming").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author = Guernsey Financial Services Commission|title = Consultation on Parental Upstreaming and the Introduction of Depositor Protection and Ombudsman Schemes|url = https://www.gfsc.gg/UserFiles/File/Banking/Consultation_on_Parental_Upstreaming_and_the_Introduction_of_Depositor_Protection_and_Ombudsman_Schemes.pdf|accessdate = 15 October 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081029195833/https://www.gfsc.gg/UserFiles/File/Banking/Consultation_on_Parental_Upstreaming_and_the_Introduction_of_Depositor_Protection_and_Ombudsman_Schemes.pdf|archivedate = 29 October 2008|url-status = dead|date = August 2008|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landsbanki operated in Guernsey through a legally independent subsidiary.

The existence of a bank run on Landsbanki accounts in the UK in the period up to 7 October seems confirmed by a statement from the bank on 10 October, which said "Landsbanki Íslands hf. transferred substantial funds to its UK branch during this time to fulfil its Icesave commitments."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Statement from Landsbanki Íslands hf: Landsbanki did not transfer funds from the UK to Iceland|author = Landsbanki Íslands hf|date = 10 October 2008|url = http://www.landsbanki.is/english/aboutlandsbanki/pressreleases/?GroupID=720&amp;NewsID=13336&amp;y=0&amp;p=1|archive-url = http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20081114214700/http://www.landsbanki.is/english/aboutlandsbanki/pressreleases/?GroupID=720&amp;NewsID=13336&amp;y=0&amp;p=1|url-status = dead|archive-date = 14 November 2008|accessdate = 15 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer of funds from Landsbanki Guernsey to [[Heritable Bank]],&lt;ref name="LBgg"/&gt; a Landsbanki subsidiary in the UK, also suggests a bank run in the UK. A transfer of "substantial funds" from Iceland to the UK would have been a significant downward push on the value of the króna, even before the effects of any speculation.

==Bank restructuring==
Wholesale funding disappeared in September 2008 leading to the collapse of Glitnir, Kaupthing and Landsbanki. Due to the size of the combined balance sheet of those banks the government of Iceland did not have the means to save those banks. They were put into receivership instead with their boards replaced. Nevertheless, the failed banks were restructured by dividing them into a new and an old bank in order to avoid a [[credit crunch]].&lt;ref name="Zsolt Darvas p. 6-7"&gt;[[BRUEGEL]] policy contribution Dezember 2011, Zsolt Darvas, ''A Tale of Three Countries: Recovery after Banking Crises'', p. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==

===Within Iceland===
{{Update section|date=November 2015}}
The current{{when|date=November 2015}} economic climate in the country has affected many Icelandic businesses and citizens. With the creation of [[Nýi Landsbanki]], the new organisation which replaces the old Landsbanki, around 300 employees will{{when|date=November 2015}} lose their jobs due to a radical restructuring of the organisation which is intended to minimise the bank's international operations. Similar job losses are{{when|date=November 2015}} expected at Glitnir and Kaupthing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Um 300 fá ekki störf í Nýja Landsbankanum|publisher = mbl.is|accessdate = 13 October 2008|date = 13 October 2008|url = http://www.mbl.is/mm/frettir/innlent/2008/10/13/um_300_fa_ekki_storf_i_nyja_landsbankanum/|language=is}}&lt;/ref&gt; The job losses can be compared with the 2,136 registered unemployed and 495 advertised vacancies in Iceland at the end of August 2008.&lt;ref name="CBI-EI"/&gt;

Other companies have also been affected. For example, the private [[Sterling Airlines]] declared bankruptcy on 29 October 2008. The national airline [[Icelandair]] has noticed a significant slump in domestic demand for flights. However, the airline states that year-on-year international demand is up from last year. Guðjón Arngrímsson, a spokesman for the airline, said "we're getting decent traffic from other markets... we are trying to let the weak króna help us." He has also stated that it is impossible to predict whether the company will be profitable this year.&lt;ref name="icelandair"&gt;{{cite news|title = Iceland businesses feel sting of financial crisis|work = Reuters|date = 10 October 2008|accessdate=11 October 2008|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssIndustryMaterialsUtilitiesNews/idUSLA15877520081010|first=Brett|last=Young|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081011104227/https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssIndustryMaterialsUtilitiesNews/idUSLA15877520081010|archivedate= 11 October 2008 |url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Morgunblaðið]]'', an Icelandic newspaper, is cutting some jobs and merging parts of its operations with the media corporation [[365 (media corporation)|365]].

Since October 2008, 14% of the workforce have experienced reductions in pay, and around 7% have had their working hours reduced. According to the president of the [[Icelandic Federation of Labour]] (ASÍ), [[Gylfi Arnbjörnsson]], these figures are lower than expected. 85% of those registered as unemployed in Iceland stated that they lost their job in October, after the economic collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Salary Cuts for 14 Percent of Wage Earners|url = http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=16539&amp;ew_0_a_id=318273|publisher = IcelandReview|date = 14 January 2009|accessdate = 14 January 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090131134203/http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=16539&amp;ew_0_a_id=318273|archivedate = 31 January 2009|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 July 2009, lawmakers voted 33–28 (with two abstentions) to approve a government plan for Iceland to apply for full European Union membership.  Although Iceland (as a member of [[European Free Trade Area|EFTA]]) already had a free trade arrangement with the EU, it had always rejected full membership due to concerns that its independence could be compromised.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} However, Prime Minister [[Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir]], who was elected in April, had promised to bring Iceland into the EU to help stabilize its economy. EU enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn expressed support for Iceland's membership, stating that as "a country with deep democratic traditions", Iceland will be welcome in the EU's expansion plans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/07/17/iceland.eu.application/index.html?iref=newssearch "Iceland applies to join European Union"].

On 12 March 2015, Foreign Minister of Iceland [[Gunnar Bragi Sveinsson]] stated that he had sent a letter to the EU withdrawing the application for membership, without the approval of the [[Althing]], though the European Union stated that Iceland had not formally withdrawn the application.&lt;ref&gt;RÚV, [http://ruv.is/frett/umsoknin-ekki-formlega-dregin-til-baka   Application not formally withdrawn]&lt;/ref&gt;)

In October 2008, an agreement was reached between the Icelandic and Dutch governments on the savings of about 120,000 Dutch citizens. The Icelandic government agreed to cover the first €20,887 on savings accounts of Dutch citizens held by Landsbanki subsidiary Icesave, using money lent by the Dutch government.

The cost of deposit insurance in the UK was unclear in November 2008. The [[Financial Services Compensation Scheme]] (FSCS) paid around £3 billion to transfer deposits from Heritable Bank and Kaupthing Singer &amp; Friedlander to ING Direct, while the UK Treasury paid an additional £600 million to guarantee retail deposits that were higher than the FSCS limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081013/wmstext/81013m0001.htm#08101310000002|date = 13 October 2008|author = The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Alistair Darling)|title = Written ministerial statements – TREASURY – Contingencies Fund|accessdate = 25 November 2008|publisher = [[Hansard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Treasury also paid out £800 million to guarantee Icesave deposits that were higher than the limit. A loan of £2.2 billion to the Icelandic government was expected to cover the claims against the Icelandic DIGF relating to Icesave, while the exposure of the UK FSCS is expected to be £1-2 billion. The [[Supreme Court of Iceland]], in 2011, ordered the repayment of "£4.5bn to the UK and €1.6bn (£1.2bn) by liquidating assets."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://perma.cc/75K3-TRWL|title=Britain has been fully reimbursed for Icesave bank collapse, Iceland says|date=13 January 2016|website=The Guardian|language=en-us|access-date=2019-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, [[Financial Times|The Financial Times]] reported that HM Treasury "had been paid £740m from the Landsbanki estate."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Iceland refunds Treasury over Landsbanki collapse|last=Dunkley|first=Emma|date=January 16, 2016|work=Financial Times|access-date=|edition=London|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This payment by the Landsbanki estate was the final repayment to the UK's treasury, which totaled £4.6bn.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The crisis also prompted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to reduce its foreign aid to developing nations, from 0.31% to 0.27% of GNP.  The effect of the aid cut was greatly amplified by the falling value of the króna: the budget of the [[Icelandic International Development Agency]] (ICEIDA) was reduced from US$22 million to $13 million.  Since Iceland's foreign aid is targeted in sectors for which the country has particular expertise (e.g., fisheries, geothermal power), the cutbacks will have a substantial impact in countries which receive Icelandic aid – most noticeably in Sri Lanka, where ICEIDA is pulling out altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Iceland's Development Community Grapples with Foreign Aid Cut|publisher = Devex|date = 23 February 2009|accessdate = 24 September 2009|author = Ryan Weddle|url= http://www.devex.com/articles/iceland-s-development-community-grapples-with-foreign-aid-cut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 August 2009, Iceland's parliament voted 34–15 (with 14 abstentions) to approve a bill (commonly referred to as the ''Icesave bill'') to pay the United Kingdom and the Netherlands more than $5 billion lost in Icelandic deposit accounts. Initially opposed in June, the bill was passed after amendments were added which set a ceiling on the payment based on the country's gross domestic product. Opponents of the bill argued that Icelanders, already reeling from the crisis, should not have to pay for mistakes made by private banks under the watch of other governments. However, the government argued that if the bill failed to pass, the UK and the Netherlands might retaliate by blocking a planned aid package for Iceland from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Under the deal, up to 4% of Iceland's gross domestic product (GDP) will be paid to the UK, in sterling terms, from 2017–2023 while the Netherlands will receive up to 2% of Iceland's GDP, in euro terms, for the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Valdimarsson, Omar (28 August 2009).

Kafli Verkefni og skipan nefndarinnar}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Althing]] established a Special Investigation Commission (SIC), which came to consist of Supreme Court Justice Páll Hreinsson who served as chairman, [[Parliamentary Ombudsman]] Tryggvi Gunnarsson and Sigríður Benediktsdóttir associate chair at [[Yale University]], to investigate the causes and lessons of the crisis. The commission released its [[The Report of the Investigation Commission of Althing|report]] on 12 April 2010.

===Icelandic criminal investigations===
The Office of the Special Prosecutor was founded with the passage of a bill in the Icelandic parliament 10 December 2008. The aim was to investigate suspected criminal conduct leading up to, in connection with or in the wake of the banking crisis, whether these relate to the activities of financial undertakings, other legal entities or individuals, and, as appropriate, to follow up these investigations by bringing charges in court against those concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In February 2009, [[Ólafur Hauksson]] (b. Reykjavík 1964) was appointed; it was the Icelandic government's second attempt to appoint to the role, and Ólafur was one of only two applicants. He had previously been the police chief in [[Akranes]]. At the time the unit had four staff members; by September 2013 it had 109, with 140 cases under investigation. By that time, the top managers of all three Icelandic banks which collapsed during the financial crisis had been charged, though the cases progressed slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Faris, 'Iceland Prosecutor Investigates, Convicts Bankers for Financial Crimes', ''Bloomberg Business', 12 September 2013, https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-09-12/iceland-prosecutor-investigates-convicts-bankers-for-financial-crimes#p1&lt;nowiki/&gt;.''&lt;/ref&gt; The last active investigation related to the financial crisis concluded in December 2017; 202 cases had been investigated in total over the period, with 23 of them ending up in court.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ruv.is/frett/rannsokn-allra-hrunmala-er-lokid|title=Rannsókn allra hrunmála er lokið|date=2018-01-24|work=RÚV|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2018, 13 of the court cases ended with guilty verdicts, four with not guilty verdicts and six trials were still pending.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The investigation has been focusing on a number of questionable financial practices engaged in by Icelandic banks:
*Almost half of all the loans made by Icelandic banks were to holdings companies, many of which are connected to those same Icelandic banks.
*Money was allegedly lent by the banks to their employees and associates so they could buy shares in those same banks while simply using those same shares as collateral for the loans. Borrowers were then allowed to defer paying interest on the loan until the end of the period, when the whole amount plus interest accrued was due. These same loans were then allegedly written off days before the banks collapsed.
*[[Kaupthing]] allowed a Qatari investor to purchase 5% of its shares. It was later revealed that the Qatari investor "bought" the stake using a loan from Kaupthing itself and a holding company associated with one of its employees (i.e., the bank was, in effect, buying its own shares).&lt;ref name="bankinginquiry"&gt;Mason, Rowena (14 April 2009).

===Arrests by UK Serious Fraud Office===
On 9 March 2011, [[Robert Tchenguiz|Robert]] and [[Vincent Tchenguiz]] were arrested in London by the UK's [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] as part of their ongoing investigation in conjunction with Iceland's Special Prosecutor's Office into the collapse of Icelandic Bank Kaupthing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12688072 "Robert and Vincent Tchenguiz arrested in Iceland probe"].

==Scrutiny of Icelandic business leaders==
Since the crisis began, many of Iceland's business leaders, who had previously been considered financial gurus who greatly developed Iceland's economy, are now under intense public scrutiny for their roles in causing the financial crisis:
*[[Jón Ásgeir Jóhannesson]] and [[Jóhannes Jónsson]], the owners of the [[Baugur Group]] retail empire, which includes [[Hamleys]], [[House of Fraser]], [[The Oasis Centre]] and a large portion of Iceland's media. Jón Ásgeir, who had been known as the "popstar businessman" due to his shaggy golden mullet, has become the subject of a satirical video on YouTube set to the theme of the movie ''[[The Godfather]]''. In addition, a former mistress later revealed details of his "playboy lifestyle" during a trial that found him guilty of false accounting (which prompted the Baugur Group to relocate to the United Kingdom).
*[[Lýður Guðmundsson]] and Águst Guðmundsson,&lt;ref&gt;The Águst Guðmundsson involved here should not be confused with [[Águst Guðmundsson]], who is a famous Icelandic filmmaker of the same name.&lt;/ref&gt; the frozen food entrepreneurs who were in charge of Kaupthing.
*[[Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson]] and [[Björgólfur Guðmundsson]], the shipping and brewing moguls who owned Landsbanki.&lt;ref name=bankinginquiry/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Rowena (19 October 2008). [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/3227409/Iceland-falls-out-of-love-with-its-billionaires-financial-crisis.html "Iceland falls out of love with its billionaires"]. ''The Telegraph''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Reportedly, all of those under scrutiny are now rarely seen in public and some have apparently left the country. They are also reportedly the subjects of an ongoing investigation to determine if any of their business practices warrant criminal prosecution.&lt;ref name=bankinginquiry/&gt;

==Statements from former politicians==
Former Prime Minister Davíð Oddsson has claimed that Iceland needs to investigate "unusual and unconventional loans" given by the banks to senior politicians during the years before the crisis.&lt;ref name=bankinginquiry/&gt;

[[Björn Bjarnson]], the former Minister for Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs, has started a blog detailing the problems with the business sector and the efforts to cover them up. This was cited as an example of how politicians and businessmen, who traditionally held a tight grip over the Icelandic media, have lost this control and that dozens of similar blogs have been created. Björn stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“I have written a lot about problems in the business sector over the last 14 years, and I can only compare some parts of it to Enron. Here companies have been playing a game, using the media and publishing to make themselves look good. We only hope that the foreign media will soon begin to understand what has been going on.”&lt;ref name=bankinginquiry/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Political aftermath==

[[File:Mótmælendur við Alþingishúsið.jpg|thumb|right|Some of the 6000 protesters in front of the ''Alþingishús'', seat of the Icelandic parliament, on 15 November 2008.]]
Parts of the Icelandic public have arranged protests against the Central Bank, the [[Althingi|Parliament]] and the government's alleged lack of responsibility before and after the crisis, attracting between 3000 and 6000 people (1–2% of Iceland's population) on Saturdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Icelanders Take to Streets to Protest Policy Makers' Failures.

In early November 2008, the [[President of Iceland]], [[Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson]], at an informal lunch with foreign diplomats, criticized Iceland's traditional friends (particularly Britain, Sweden and Denmark) as well as the International Monetary Fund. According to a memo from the Norwegian embassy, he suggested that the Russians might want to use the [[Keflavík Air Base]], the Russian ambassador replied that they had no need for it. The President is quoted to have said that Iceland would soon recover, even if they had to fight alone. The President does not necessarily agree with the government on these issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Skjeseth, Alf|url = http://klassekampen.no/55221/article/item/null|title = Inviterer Russland|publisher = Klassekampen|date = 12 November 2008|accessdate = 13 November 2008|language = no|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090104171235/http://klassekampen.no/55221/article/item/null|archive-date = 4 January 2009|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://politiken.dk/newsinenglish/article596825.ece|title = Iceland: Denmark has turned its back|newspaper = Politiken|date = 12 November 2008|accessdate = 13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, the UK PM [[Gordon Brown]] used provisions in part 2 of the [[Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]] to freeze Landsbanki holdings in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1855901,00.html "Iceland to Britain: 'We're No Terrorists'"]. "Time". 3 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland's prime minister Geir Haarde protested against what he described as "a terrorist law being applied against us", calling it "a completely unfriendly act".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/who-are-you-calling-terrorists-mr-brown-971471.html "Who are you calling terrorists, Mr Brown?"].

''The Times''. 10 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Angered by the British decision, Iceland decided to submit a formal complaint to [[NATO]] about their move, and it also provoked more than 80,000 Icelanders (equal to 25% of its entire population) to sign an online petition set up under the heading "Icelanders are not terrorists". The relationship got even tenser when UK replied a month later by cancelling its scheduled patrol of the Icelandic airspace in December 2008. Iceland has no [[Military of Iceland|standing army]] of its own, and relies on a long-term standing agreement with NATO where a group of member states have committed in turns to defend the Icelandic airspace, and the UK [[Royal Air Force]] had now cancelled this after mutual agreement with NATO (presumably with another member state having accepted the responsibility).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-11-14-727094515_x.htm|title = British air force mission to Iceland scrapped|work=USA Today|date = 14 November 2008|accessdate = 15 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a poll from late November 2008, 64% were in favour of early elections, with only 29.3% opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90853/6540625.html|title=Poll: Majority of Icelanders want early elections – People's Daily Online|work=People's Daily|date=26 November 2008|accessdate=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a poll from 22 November 2008, the Social Democratic Alliance led with 33.6%, followed by the Left-Green Alliance at 27.8% and the Independence Party at 24.8%; the Progressive Party and the Liberal Party were far behind, with only 6.3% and 4.3%, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/32339/social_alliance_leads_rivals_in_iceland|title=Social Alliance Leads Rivals in Iceland: Angus Reid Global Monitor|publisher=Angus-reid.com|accessdate=11 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227043049/http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/32339/social_alliance_leads_rivals_in_iceland|archive-date=27 December 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Parliament met again on 20 January 2009, there were [[2009 Icelandic financial crisis protests|protests]] with reinvigorated force and escalation of conflict between protesters and the police. On 22 January, police used tear gas to disperse people on [[Austurvöllur]] (the square in front of the Alþing), the first such use since the [[1949 anti-NATO riot in Iceland|1949 anti-NATO protest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbl.is/mm/frettir/innlent/2009/01/22/taragasi_beitt_a_austurvelli/|title=Táragasi beitt á Austurvelli|publisher=mbl.is|accessdate=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government resignation===
Prime Minister [[Geir H. Haarde]] announced on 23 January 2009 that he would be stepping down as leader of the [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]] for health reasons: he has been diagnosed as having a [[Esophageal cancer|malignant oesophageal tumour]]. He said he would travel to the Netherlands around the end of January for treatment. [[Minister of Education, Science and Culture (Iceland)|Education Minister]] and Independence Party vice-chairman [[Þorgerður Katrín Gunnarsdóttir]] was to serve as Prime Minister in his absence. The leader of the [[Social Democratic Alliance]], [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Iceland)|Foreign Minister]] [[Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir]], was also unwell, undergoing treatment for a [[benign tumor|benign]] brain tumour since September 2008. The government recommended that elections be held on 9 May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = PM of Iceland steps down, elections to take place in May|url = http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2009/01/23/pm-of-iceland-steps-down-elections-to-take-place-in-may/#more-5432|publisher = IceNews|date = 23 January 2008|accessdate = 23 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Björgvin G. Sigurðsson]], Iceland's [[Minister of Business Affairs (Iceland)|Commerce Minister]], resigned on 25 January, citing the pressures of the nation's economic collapse, as the country's political leaders failed to agree on how to lead country out of its financial crisis. One of his last acts as minister was to dismiss the director of the [[Financial Supervisory Authority (Iceland)|Financial Supervisory Authority]] (FSA). Björgvin acknowledged that Icelanders have lost faith in their government and political system. "I want to shoulder my part of the responsibility for that," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Iceland's commerce minister quits, citing meltdown|url = http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2009/jan/25/eu-iceland-elections-012509/?ap|agency = Associated Press|work=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date = 25 January 2009|accessdate = 4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiations on continuing the coalition broke down the next day, apparently over demands from the Social Democratic Alliance to take over the leadership of the government, and Geir Haarde tendered the government's resignation to the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Prime Minister Formally Tenders Government's Resignation|url = http://eng.forsaetisraduneyti.is/news-and-articles/nr/3348|publisher = Prime Minister's Office|location=Iceland|date = 26 January 2009|accessdate= 25 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The President asked the present government to continue until a new government can be formed,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Iceland's coalition government resigns|url = http://eng.utanrikisraduneyti.is/speeches-and-articles/nr/4746|publisher = Ministry of Foreign Affairs|date = 26 January 2009|accessdate= 25 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and held talks with the five political parties represented in the Althing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Iceland's 'figurehead' president has important decision to make|url = http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2009/01/26/icelands-figurehead-president-has-important-decision-to-make/|publisher = IceNews|date = 26 January 2009|accessdate = 26 January 2009|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090131213809/http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2009/01/26/icelands-figurehead-president-has-important-decision-to-make/|archivedate= 31 January 2009 |url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After these discussions, Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir of the Social Democratic Alliance and [[Steingrímur J. Sigfússon]] of the [[Left-Green Movement]] were asked by the President to negotiate the formation of a new coalition government. Such a coalition would be five seats short of an overall majority in the Althing, but the [[Progressive Party (Iceland)|Progressive Party]] (seven seats) was expected to support the coalition without actually joining the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = New Icelandic government under negotiation|url = http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2009/01/27/new-icelandic-government-being-negotiated/|publisher = IceNews|date = 27 January 2009|accessdate= 25 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither party leader became Prime Minister: instead, the position went to Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir of the Social Democratic Alliance, then the [[Minister of Social Affairs and Social Security (Iceland)|Minister of Social Affairs and Social Security]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Sigurdardóttir Ready to Become Iceland's PM|url = http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=16567&amp;ew_0_a_id=319005|publisher = Iceland Review|date = 27 January 2009|accessdate= 25 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who became the new chairwoman of her party on 28 March 2009.

On 8 April 2009, former Prime Minister Geir H. Haarde stated that he was solely responsible for accepting controversial donations to the Icelandic Independence Party in 2006, ISK 30 million from the investment group [[FL Group]], and ISK 25 million from Landsbanki.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher = Eyjan|title = Geir Haarde segist bera einn alla ábyrgð á FL Group styrknum|url = http://eyjan.is/blog/2009/04/08/geir-haarde-segist-bera-einn-alla-abyrgd-a-fl-group-styrknum/|date = 8 April 2009|accessdate = 1 October 2010|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090411144615/http://eyjan.is/blog/2009/04/08/geir-haarde-segist-bera-einn-alla-abyrgd-a-fl-group-styrknum/|archive-date = 11 April 2009|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geir was strongly criticized in the April 2010 report of the Special Investigative Commission into the financial collapse, being accused of "negligence" along with three other ministers of his government.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url = http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/search/news/Default.asp?ew_0_a_id=360575|date = 14 April 2010|newspaper = Iceland Review|title = Crisis Report: Icelandic Ministers Were Negligent|accessdate = 1 October 2010|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101003104847/http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/search/news/Default.asp?ew_0_a_id=360575|archivedate = 3 October 2010|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Helgason, Gudjon |author2=Dodds, Paisley |title= Iceland Ex-PM Faces Possible Charges in Meltdown|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=11748263|work= [[ABC News]]|agency= AP|date= 28 September 2010|accessdate= 28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland's parliament voted 33–30 to indict Geir, but not the other ministers, on charges of negligence in office at a session on 28 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Iceland's Former PM Taken to Court|url= http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=16539&amp;ew_0_a_id=368276|work= [[Iceland Review]]|date= 28 September 2010|accessdate= 28 September 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110325065640/http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=16539&amp;ew_0_a_id=368276|archive-date= 25 March 2011|url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He will stand trial before the ''[[Landsdómur]]'', a special court to hear cases alleging misconduct in government office: it will be the first time the ''Landsdómur'' has convened since it was established in the 1905 [[Constitution of Iceland|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Islands tidligere statsminister stilles for riksrett |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/article3831879.ece |work=[[Aftenposten]] |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency|NTB]] |location=Oslo, Norway |language=Norwegian |date=28 September 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001222900/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/article3831879.ece |archivedate=1 October 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial began in Reykjavik on 5 March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17254544 "Trial of Iceland ex-PM Haarde over 2008 crisis begins"].

==Crisis resolution==

===Recovery starting in 2011===
Iceland's financial position has steadily improved since the crash. The economic contraction and rise in unemployment appear to have been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid-2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/document/16/0,3746,en_2649_201185_43946384_1_1_1_1,00.html "OECD Economic Surveys – Iceland, June 2011"]. oecd.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Three main factors have been important in this regard. First is the emergency legislation passed by the Icelandic parliament in October 2008. It served to minimise the impact of the [[Financial crisis of 2007-2008#Week of 5 October 2008|financial crisis]] on the country. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://e24.no/spesial/finanskrisen/article2696518.ece |title=Gud velsigne Island!( Finanskrisen, Makro og politkk, Utenriks ) |publisher=E24.no |date=6 October 2008 |accessdate=8 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120702211413/http://e24.no/spesial/finanskrisen/article2696518.ece |archivedate=2 July 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The much larger foreign operations of the banks, however, went into receivership.

A second important factor is the success of the IMF [[Stand-By-Arrangement]] in the country since November 2008. The SBA includes three pillars. The first pillar is a program of medium term fiscal consolidation, involving painful austerity measures and significant tax hikes. The result has been that central government debts have been stabilised at around 80–90 percent of GDP. A second pillar is the resurrection of a viable but sharply downsized domestic banking system on the ruins of its gargantuan international banking system which the government was unable to bail out. A third pillar is the enactment of capital controls and the work to gradually lift these to restore normal financial linkages with the outside world. An important result of the emergency legislation and the SBA is that the country has not been seriously affected by the [[European sovereign debt crisis]] from 2010. Despite a contentious debate with Britain and the Netherlands over the question of a state guarantee on the Icesave deposits of Landsbanki in these countries, [[credit default swaps]] on Icelandic sovereign debt have steadily declined from over 1000 points prior to the crash in 2008 to around 200 points in June 2011. The fact that the assets of the failed Landsbanki branches were estimated to cover most of the depositor claims had an influence to ease concerns over the situation.

Finally, the third major factor behind the resolution of the financial crisis was the decision by the government of Iceland to apply for membership in the EU in July 2009. While views on the feasibility of EU membership are quite mixed in Iceland, this action has served to enhance the credibility of the country on international financial markets. One sign of the success of the above efforts is the fact that the Icelandic government was successfully able to raise $1 billion with a bond issue on 9 June 2011. This development indicates that international investors have given the government and the new banking system, with two of the three biggest banks now in foreign hands, a clean bill of health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/Article/2845172/Iceland-To-Raise-1B-In-Bond-Sale.html?ArticleId=2845172|title=Iceland To Raise $1B in Bond Sale|work=Institutional Investor|accessdate=17 June 2011|date=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304319804576387572241329838?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=Iceland's Banks Come in From the Cold|author=Asgeir Jonsson|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=17 June 2011|date=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two major measures were implemented by the government of [[Geir H. Haarde]] but also carried out by the government of Johanna Sigurdardottir, which then took the step to apply for EU membership.

Iceland has undertaken recapitalization of lenders such as injection of ISK 33 billion (2.1% of 2010 GDP) into [[Housing Financing Fund]] at the end of 2010, under a restructuring plan approved by the [[European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority|EFTSA]].&lt;ref&gt;OECD Economic Surveys: Iceland 2011 -OECD – 2011  Page 50 "The Housing Finance Fund (cont.).. The increasing difficulties that many households have had in paying their mortgages since the financial crisis struck have necessitated substantial debt restructuring, eroding the HFF's capital. Including debt write-downs associated with the December 2010 agreement between the government and the main mortgage loan providers to reduce the value of certain mortgages to 110% of the value of the underlying property, impaired loans soared from ISK 3.4 billion (0.4% of the HFF's loan portfolio) in 2009 to ISK 38.8 billion (5.2% of the loan portfolio) in 2010. To ensure that the HFF remained solvent, the government made a capital injection of ISK 33 billion (2.1% of 2010 GDP) at the end of 2010. The European Surveillance Authority recently approved this state ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath (2012–2013)===
{{Update|section|date=August 2014}}
By mid-2012 Iceland was regarded as one of Europe's recovery success stories. It has had two years of economic growth. Unemployment was down to 6.3% and Iceland was attracting immigrants to fill jobs. Currency devaluation effectively reduced wages by 50% making exports more competitive and imports more expensive. Ten-year government bonds were issued below 6%, lower than some of the [[PIGS (economics)|PIIGS]] nations in the EU (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain). Tryggvi Thor Herbertsson, a member of parliament, noted that adjustments via currency devaluations are less painful than government labor policies and negotiations. Nevertheless, while EU fervor has cooled the government continued to pursue membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304203604577396171007652042?mod=ITP_pageone_0|title=In European Crisis, Iceland Emerges as an Island of Recovery|author=Forelle, Charles|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iceland [[2013 Icelandic parliamentary election|elected]] a [[Cabinet of Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson|new government]] in April 2013, which as one of their top priorities wanted to negotiate a debt [[Haircut (finance)|haircut]] towards foreign creditors of the three failed Icelandic banks now in receivership, as part of a deal to lift the long enforced (since November 2008) [[capital control]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/298407e8-b19a-11e2-b324-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2eKmrZdHa|title=Iceland's creditors braced for losses|newspaper=Financial Times|date=2 May 2013|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current capital controls ban a swap/exchange of ISK denominated assets to foreign currency, and so by effect has trapped repayment of ISK denominated assets to the creditors – which in theory mean they should be interested to accept a haircut in return for getting the capital controls lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uti.is/2013/07/aspects-of-capital-controls-in-iceland-and-cyprus-and-the-long-time-damaging-effect/|title=Sigrún Davíðsdóttir's Icelog|publisher=|date=23 July 2013|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-30/iceland-lacks-currency-for-easy-exit-of-krona-creditors-1-.html|title=Iceland Lacks Currency for Easy Exit of Krona Creditors|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=30 April 2013|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Icelandic government intent somehow to route the saved money from the negotiated debt haircut for creditors into a national household debt relief fund, enabling a 20% debt relief for all household mortgages. In July 2013, Standard &amp; Poors recommended Iceland to drop the debt relief initiative, as it would only result in increased debt for the government – making it even more difficult to lend at credit markets, and it was forecasted also to ignite high inflation along with an economic recession equal to a GDP detraction of 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/20fa6168-f5fa-11e2-a55d-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=intl#axzz2eKmrZdHa|title=S&amp;P warns Iceland over debt write-off plan|newspaper=Financial Times|date=26 July 2013|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has nevertheless appointed a taskforce to present proposals on how best to achieve the government's goal about implementing a combined capital control abolition and debt relief for households, with a reporting deadline in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-21/iceland-keeps-western-europe-s-highest-rate-as-inflation-slows.html|title=Iceland Keeps Western Europe's Highest Rate as Krona Stable|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=21 August 2013|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/video/iceland-premier-says-no-date-to-lift-controls-1b~cNwqVTO6wEvCKoF6rww.html|title=Iceland Premier Says No Date to Lift Controls (video interview)|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=20 September 2013|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capital controls were eventually ended in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, '[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39248677 Iceland to end capital controls from 2008 financial crisis]' (12 March 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant amount of the capital trapped in Iceland by the capital controls was channelled into property investment, partly by the financial management company Gamma, and was one factor that fuelled rising property prices in Iceland after the crash.&lt;ref&gt;Kári Tulinius, '[https://grapevine.is/culture/literature-and-poetry/2015/06/09/so-whats-this-literary-scandal-i-keep-hearing-about/ So What’s This Literary Scandal I Keep Hearing About?]', ''The Reykjavík Grapevine'' (June 9, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;
