It consisted of a [[Lander (spacecraft)|lander]], renamed the '''[[Carl Sagan]] Memorial Station''', and a lightweight (10.6&amp;nbsp;kg/23&amp;nbsp;lb) wheeled [[robot]]ic [[Mars rover]] named ''[[Sojourner (rover)|Sojourner]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mpfwww.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/past/pathfinder.html |title=Mars Pathfinder |work=NASA |accessdate=June 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112062226/http://mpfwww.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/past/pathfinder.html |archive-date=November 12, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; which became the first rover to operate outside the Earthâ€“Moon system.

Launched on December 4, 1996 by [[NASA]] aboard a [[Delta II]] booster a month after the ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]'' was launched, it landed on July 4, 1997 on [[Mars]]'s [[Ares Vallis]], in a region called [[Chryse Planitia]] in the [[Oxia Palus quadrangle]]. The [[lander (spacecraft)|lander]] then opened, exposing the rover which conducted many experiments on the Martian surface.
The mission carried a series of scientific instruments to analyze the Martian [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[climate]], and geology and the composition of its [[rock (geology)|rocks]] and soil. It was the second project from NASA's [[Discovery Program]], which promotes the use of low-cost spacecraft and frequent launches under the motto "cheaper, faster and better" promoted by then-administrator [[Daniel Goldin]]. The mission was directed by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL), a division of the [[California Institute of Technology]], responsible for NASA's [[Mars Exploration Program]]. The project manager was JPL's [[Tony Spear]].

This mission was the first of a series of missions to Mars that included rovers, and was the first successful lander since the two ''[[Viking program|Vikings]]'' landed on the red planet in 1976. Although the [[Soviet Union]] successfully sent rovers to the Moon as part of the [[Lunokhod program]] in the 1970s, its attempts to use rovers in its [[Mars program]] failed.

In addition to scientific objectives, the ''Mars Pathfinder'' mission was also a "proof-of-concept" for various technologies, such as [[airbag]]-mediated touchdown and automated obstacle avoidance, both later exploited by the [[Mars Exploration Rover]] mission. The ''Mars Pathfinder'' was also remarkable for its extremely low cost relative to other robotic space missions to Mars. Originally, the mission was conceived as the first of the [[Mars Environmental Survey]] (MESUR) program.

==Mission objectives==
* To prove that the development of "faster, better and cheaper" spacecraft was possible (with three years for development and a cost under $150&amp;nbsp;million).
* To show that it was possible to send a load of scientific instruments to another planet with a simple system and at one-fifteenth the cost of a [[Viking program|Viking]] mission. (For comparison, the Viking missions cost $935&amp;nbsp;million in 1974&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://solarviews.com/history/SP-4212/ch8-6.html |chapter=Viking Lander: Building A Complex Spacecraft - Reorganizations and Additional Cutbacks |url=http://solarviews.com/history/SP-4212/contents.html |title=On Mars: Exploration of the Red Planet 1958-1978 |first1=Edward Clinton |last1=Ezell |first2=Linda Neuman |last2=Ezell |pages=268â€“270 |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |location=Washington, D.C. |year=1984 |accessdate=June 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408053821/http://solarviews.com/history/SP-4212/contents.html |archive-date=April 8, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; or $3.5&amp;nbsp;billion in 1997 dollars.)
* To demonstrate NASA's commitment to low-cost planetary exploration by finishing the mission with a total expenditure of $280&amp;nbsp;million, including the launch vehicle and mission operations.

The ''[[Sojourner (rover)|Sojourner]]'' rover had an Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer ([[APXS]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Determination of the chemical composition of Martian soil and rocks: The alpha proton X ray spectrometer |author1=R.

The rover also had two black-and-white cameras and a color one. These instruments could investigate the geology of the Martian surface from just a few millimeters to many hundreds of meters, the [[geochemistry]] and evolutionary history of the rocks and surface, the [[magnetic]] and [[mechanics|mechanical]] properties of the land, as well as the magnetic properties of the dust, atmosphere and the [[rotation]]al and [[orbit]]al dynamics of the planet.
[[File:h rover-comp wheels 02.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wheel size comparison: ''Sojourner'', [[Mars Exploration Rover]], [[Mars Science Laboratory]]]]
Three [[navcam|navigation cameras]] were on board the rover: Two black and white 0.3-[[megapixel]] cameras were located on the front (768 horizontal [[pixel]]s Ã— 484 vertical pixels configured in 4Ã—4+100 pixel blocks),{{Clarify|reason=what does this pixel configuration mean?|date=September 2019}} coupled with five [[laser]] stripe projectors, which enabled [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] images to be taken along with measurements for hazard detection on the rover's path. A third camera with the same resolution but taking color images was located on the back, near the APXS, and rotated by 90Â°. It provided images of the APXS's target area and the rover's tracks on the ground. The pixels of this colour camera were arranged in such a way, that out of the 16 pixel of a 4Ã—4 pixel block, 12 pixel were sensitive to green, 2 pixel to red and 2 pixel were sensitive to [[infrared]] as well as blue. As all cameras had [[camera lens|lenses]] made out of [[zinc selenide]], which blocks light below a [[wavelength]] of 500&amp;nbsp;nm, no blue light actually reached these "blue/infrared" pixels, which therefore recorded only infrared.

All three cameras were [[Charge-coupled device|CCDs]] manufactured by [[Eastman Kodak Company]], and were controlled by the rover's [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. They all had auto-exposure and capabilities for handling bad pixels, and the image parameters (exposure time, compression used, etc.) were included in the transmitted images as part of the [[image header]]. The rover could [[data compression|compress]] the front cameras' images using the [[block truncation coding]] (BTC) algorithm, but it could only do the same for the back camera's images if the colour information was discarded. The cameras' [[optical resolution]] was sufficient to resolve 0.6&amp;nbsp;cm details across a 0.65&amp;nbsp;m range.&lt;ref name="sojcam" /&gt;

==Landing site==
The landing site was an ancient flood plain in Mars's northern hemisphere called "[[Ares Vallis]]" ("the valley of Ares", the ancient Greek equivalent of the ancient Roman deity Mars) and is among the rockiest parts of Mars. Scientists chose it because they found it to be a relatively safe surface to land on and one that contained a wide variety of rocks deposited during a catastrophic flood. After the landing, at {{Coord|19.13|N|33.22|W|globe:Mars|display=inline,title}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mpfwww.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/science/geology.html | title=Mars Pathfinder Science Results | work=NASA | access-date=June 9, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920093840/http://mpfwww.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/science/geology.html | archive-date=September 20, 2008 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; succeeded, the lander received the name ''The [[Carl Sagan]] Memorial Station'' in honor of the [[astronomer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mars lander renamed for Sagan|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/97/sagansta.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=September 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181211162346/https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/97/sagansta.html|archive-date=December 11, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[List of extraterrestrial memorials]])

==Entry, descent and landing==
[[File:Atmospheric entry.gif|thumb|left|200px|1990s illustration of Mars atmospheric entry]]{{More citations needed section|date=September 2019}}
''Mars Pathfinder'' entered the Martian atmosphere and landed using an innovative system involving an entry capsule, a supersonic [[parachute]], followed by solid rockets and large airbags to cushion the impact.

''Mars Pathfinder'' directly entered Mars atmosphere in a retrograde direction from a hyperbolic trajectory at 6.1&amp;nbsp;km/s using an atmospheric entry aeroshell (capsule) that was derived from the original Viking Mars lander design. The aeroshell consisted of a back shell and a specially designed ablative heatshield to slow to 370&amp;nbsp;m/s (830&amp;nbsp;mph) where a supersonic disk-gap-band parachute was inflated to slow its descent through the thin Martian atmosphere to 68&amp;nbsp;m/s (about 150&amp;nbsp;mph). The lander's on-board computer used redundant on-board accelerometers to determine the timing of the parachute inflation. Twenty seconds later the heatshield was pyrotechnically released. Another twenty seconds later the lander was separated and lowered from the backshell on a 20&amp;nbsp;m bridle (tether). When the lander reached 1.6&amp;nbsp;km above the surface, a radar was used by the on-board computer to determine altitude and descent velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wunsch |first1=Susan Trautmann |title=The Adventures of Sojourner: The Mission to Mars That Thrilled the World |date=1998 |publisher=Mikaya Pres |location=New York |isbn=0-9650493-6-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/adventuresofsojo00wuns/page/32 32-33] |url=https://archive.org/details/adventuresofsojo00wuns/page/32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This information was used by the computer to determine the precise timing of the landing events that followed.

[[File:Pathfinder Air Bags - GPN-2000-000484.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ''Pathfinder'' air bags are tested in June 1995]]
Once the lander was 355 m above the ground, airbags were inflated in less than a second using three catalytically cooled{{Clarify|reason=what is catalytic cooling?|date=September 2019}} solid rocket motors that served as gas generators. The airbags were made of four inter-connected multi-layer [[vectran]] bags that surrounded the tetrahedron lander. They were designed and tested to accommodate grazing angle impacts as high as 28&amp;nbsp;m/s. However, as the airbags were designed for no more than about 15&amp;nbsp;m/s vertical impacts, three solid retrorockets were mounted above the lander in the backshell. These were fired at 98&amp;nbsp;m above the ground. The lander's on-board computer estimated the best time to fire the rockets and cut the bridle so that the lander velocity would be reduced to about 0&amp;nbsp;m/s between 15 and 25&amp;nbsp;m above the ground. After 2.3 seconds, while the rockets were still firing, the lander cut the bridle loose about 21.5&amp;nbsp;m above the ground and fell to the ground. The rockets flew up and away with the backshell and parachute (they have since been sighted by orbital images). The lander impacted at 14&amp;nbsp;m/s and limited the impact to only 18&amp;nbsp;G of deceleration. The first bounce was 15.7&amp;nbsp;m high and continued bouncing for at least 15 additional bounces (accelerometer data recording did not continue through all of the bounces).

The entire entry, descent and landing (EDL) process was completed in four minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/mpf/edl/edl1.html |title=Entry Descent and Landing |work=JPL/NASA Mars Pathfinder |year=2005 |accessdate=June 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319230448/http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/mpf/edl/edl1.html |archive-date=March 19, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the lander stopped rolling, the airbags deflated and retracted toward the lander using four winches mounted on the lander "petals". Designed to right itself from any initial orientation, the lander happened to roll right side up onto its base petal. 74 minutes after landing, the petals were deployed with ''Sojourner'' rover and the solar panels attached on the inside.

[[File:Pan segment1.gif|thumb|left|200px|IMP image of landing site in 1997]]
The lander arrived at night at 2:56:55 Mars local solar time (16:56:55 UTC) on July 4, 1997. The lander had to wait until sunrise to send its first digital signals and images to Earth. The landing site was located at 19.30Â° north latitude and 33.52Â° west longitude in Ares Vallis, only 19 kilometres southwest of the center of the 200&amp;nbsp;km wide landing site ellipse. During [[Timekeeping on Mars#Sols|Sol]] 1, the first Martian solar day the lander spent on the planet, the lander took pictures and made some meteorologic measurements. Once the data was received, the engineers realized that one of the airbags hadn't fully deflated and could be a problem for the forthcoming traverse of ''Sojourner''{{'}}s descent ramp. To solve the problem, they sent commands to the lander to raise one of its petals and perform additional retraction to flatten the airbag. The procedure was a success and on Sol 2, ''Sojourner'' was released, stood up and backed down one of two ramps.

The ''Mars Pathfinder'' entry descent and landing system design was used (with some modification) on the [[Mars Exploration Rover]] mission. Likewise, many design aspects of the ''Sojourner'' rover (e.g. the [[rocker-bogie]] mobility architecture and the navigation algorithms) were also successfully used on the Mars Exploration Rover mission.

===''Sojourner'' deployment===
The ''Sojourner'' rover exit from the lander occurred on Sol 2, after its landing on July 4, 1997. As the next sols progressed it approached some rocks, which the scientists named "[[Barnacle Bill (Mars)|Barnacle Bill]]", "[[Yogi Rock|Yogi]]", and "[[Scooby-Doo]]", after famous [[cartoon]] characters. The rover made measurements of the elements found in those rocks and in the martian soil, while the lander took pictures of the ''Sojourner'' and the surrounding terrain, in addition to making climate observations.

The ''Sojourner'' is a six-wheeled 65&amp;nbsp;cm long vehicle, 48&amp;nbsp;cm wide, 30&amp;nbsp;cm tall and weighing 10.5&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meeting/mar-09/02_MEPAG_McCuistion_Mar_09.pdf |format=PDF |title=Mars â€“ the search for life |date=March 4, 2009 |accessdate=March 28, 2009 |publisher=NASA |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327083233/http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meeting/mar-09/02_MEPAG_McCuistion_Mar_09.pdf |archive-date=March 27, 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its maximum speed reached one centimeter per second. ''Sojourner'' travelled approximately 100 metres in total, never more than 12&amp;nbsp;m from the ''Pathfinder'' station. During its 83 [[Timekeeping on Mars#Sols|sols]] of operation, it sent 550 photographs to Earth and analyzed the [[chemistry|chemical]] properties of 16 locations near the lander. (See also [[Rover (space exploration)|Space exploration rovers]])

===''Sojourner''{{'}}s rock analysis===
[[File:Sojourner and Barnacle Bill.jpg|thumb|''Sojourner'' next to the rock [[Barnacle Bill (Mars)|Barnacle Bill]]]]
The first analysis on a rock started on Sol 3 with Barnacle Bill. The [[APXS|Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer]] (APXS) was used to determine its composition, the spectrometer taking ten hours to make a full scan of the sample. It found all the elements except [[hydrogen]], which constitutes just 0.1 percent of the rock's or soil's mass.

The APXS works by irradiating rocks and soil samples with [[alpha particle]]s ([[helium]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], which consist of two [[proton]]s and two [[neutron]]s). The results indicated that "Barnacle Bill" is much like Earth's [[andesite]]s, confirming past [[volcano|volcanic]] activity.  The discovery of andesites shows that some Martian rocks have been remelted and reprocessed.  On Earth, andesite forms when magma sits in pockets of rock while some of the iron and magnesium settle out.  Consequently, the final rock contains less iron and magnesiums and more silica.  Volcanic rocks are usually classified by comparing the relative amount of alkalis (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) with the amount of silica (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  Andesite is different from the rocks found in meteorites that have come from Mars.&lt;ref name="Golombek, M 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/marspath/apxs.html |title=APXS Composition Results |work=NASA |accessdate=June 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603120939/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/marspath/apxs.html |archive-date=June 3, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruckner, J. 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bruckner |first1=J. |first2=G. |last2=Dreibus |first3=R. |last3=Rieder |first4=H. |last4=Wanke |year=2001 |title=Revised Data of the Mars Pathfinder Alpha Proton X-ray spectrometer: Geochemical Behavior of Major and Minor Elements |journal=Lunar and Planetary Science XXXII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of the Yogi rock again using the APXS showed that it was a [[basalt]]ic rock, more primitive than Barnacle Bill. Yogi's shape and texture show that it was probably deposited there by a [[flood]].

Another rock, named Moe, was found to have certain marks on its surface, demonstrating erosion caused by the wind. Most rocks analyzed showed a high content of [[silicon]]. In another region known as Rock Garden, ''Sojourner'' encountered crescent moon-shaped dunes, which are similar to [[dunes|crescentic dunes]] on Earth.

By the time that final results of the mission were described in a series of articles in the journal ''Science'' (December 5, 1997), it was believed that the rock Yogi contained a coating of dust, but was similar to the rock Barnacle Bill.  Calculations suggest that the two rocks contain mostly the minerals orthopyroxene (magnesium-iron silicate), feldspars (aluminum silicates of potassium, sodium, and calcium), and quartz (silicon dioxide), with smaller amounts of magnetite, ilmenite, iron sulfide, and calcium phosphate.&lt;ref name="Golombek, M 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruckner, J. 2001"/&gt;

==Results from ''Pathfinder''==
[[File:Mars sunset PIA00920.jpg|thumb|Close-up of Mars sky at sunset, by ''Mars Pathfinder'' (1997)]]
The lander sent more than 2.3 billion bits (287.5 megabytes) of information including 16,500 pictures and made 8.5 million measurements of the [[atmospheric pressure]], temperature and wind speed.&lt;ref name=jplpathfinder&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars-pathfinder/|title=Mars Pathfinder and Sojourner|work=NASA|accessdate=June 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623112234/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars-pathfinder/|archive-date=June 23, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By taking multiple images of the sky at different distances from the Sun, scientists were able to determine that the size of the particles in the pink haze was about one [[micrometre]] in radius.  The color of some soils was similar to that of an iron oxyhydroxide phase which would support the theory of a warmer and wetter climate in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, P. et al.  1997.  "Results from the Mars Pathfinder Camera" ''Science'': 278.  1758â€“1765&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pathfinder'' carried a series of magnets to examine the magnetic component of the dust. Eventually, all but one of the magnets developed a coating of dust.  Since the weakest magnet did not attract any soil, it was concluded that the airborne dust did not contain pure [[magnetite]] or just one type of [[maghemite]]. The dust probably was an aggregate possibly cemented with [[ferric oxide]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Hviid, S.  et al.  1997.  "Magnetic Properties Experiments on the Mars Pathfinder Lander:  Preliminary Results".  ''Science'':278.  1768â€“1770.&lt;/ref&gt; Using much more sophisticated instruments, [[Spirit Rover|Mars ''Spirit'' rover]] found that magnetite could explain the magnetic nature of the dust and soil on Mars.  Magnetite was found in the soil and that the most magnetic part of the soil was dark.  Magnetite is very dark.&lt;ref&gt;Bertelsen, P. et al.  2004.

Using [[Doppler tracking]] and [[two-way ranging]], scientists added earlier measurements from the ''Viking'' landers to determine that the non-hydrostatic component of the polar [[moment of inertia]] is due to the [[Tharsis bulge]] and that the interior is not melted. The central metallic core is between 1300&amp;nbsp;km and 2000&amp;nbsp;km in radius.&lt;ref name="Golombek, M 1997"&gt;Golombek, M. et al. 1997.

Although the mission was planned to last from a week to a month, the rover operated successfully for almost three months. Communication failed after October 7,&lt;ref name=batteryfailure/&gt; with a final data transmission received from Pathfinder at 10:23 UTC on September 27, 1997. Mission managers tried to restore full communications during the following five months, but the mission was terminated on March 10, 1998. During the extended operation a high-resolution stereo panorama of the surrounding terrain was being made, and the Sojourner rover was to visit a distant ridge, but the panorama was only about one-third completed and the ridge visit had not begun when communication failed.&lt;ref name=batteryfailure/&gt;

The on-board batteryâ€”designed to operate for one monthâ€”may have failed after repeated charging and discharging. The battery was used to heat the probe's electronics to slightly above the expected nighttime temperatures on Mars.

==Naming the rover==
[[File:Pathfinder01.jpg|thumb|300px|''Sojourner'' takes its Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer measurement of the [[Yogi Rock]]]]
The name ''Sojourner'' was chosen for the ''Mars Pathfinder'' rover when 12-year old Valerie Ambroise, of Bridgeport, Connecticut, won a year-long, worldwide competition in which students up to 18 years old were invited to select a heroine and submit an essay about her historical accomplishments. The students were asked to address in their essays how a planetary rover named for their heroine would translate these accomplishments to the Martian environment.

Initiated in March 1994 by [[The Planetary Society]] of Pasadena, California, in cooperation with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the contest got under way with an announcement in the January 1995 issue of the National Science Teachers Association's magazine ''Science and Children'', circulated to 20,000 teachers and schools across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Names First Rover to Explore the Surface of Mars|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/rover/name.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 29, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607010535/http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/rover/name.html|archive-date=June 7, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambroise's winning essay, which suggested naming the rover for the 19th century women's rights activist [[Sojourner Truth]], was selected from among 3,500 essays. First runner-up was Deepti Rohatgi, 18, of Rockville, Maryland, who suggested scientist [[Marie Curie]]. Second runner-up was Adam Sheedy, 15, of Round Rock, Texas, who submitted the name of the late astronaut [[Judith Resnik]], who perished in the 1986 [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] explosion. Other popular suggestions included explorer and guide [[Sacajewea]] and aviator [[Amelia Earhart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/rover/name.html |title=Pathfinder Rover Gets Its Name |work=NASA |accessdate=June 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527055515/http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/rover/name.html |archive-date=May 27, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
