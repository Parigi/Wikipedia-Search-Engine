The '''''supplicia canum''''' ("punishment of the dogs") was an annual sacrifice of [[ancient Roman religion]] in which live dogs were suspended from a ''furca'' ("fork")  or cross ''(crux)'' and paraded. It appears on none of the [[List of ancient Roman fasti|extant Roman calendars]], but a late source&lt;ref&gt;[[Johannes Lydus]], ''De mensibus'' 4.114.&lt;/ref&gt; places it on August 3 ''([[Sextilis#Dates|III Non. Aug.]])''.

In the same procession, geese were decorated in gold and purple and carried in honor. Ancient sources who explain the origin of the ''supplicia'' say that the geese were honored for saving the city during the [[Gallic siege of Rome]]. When the [[Gauls]] launched a nocturnal assault by stealth on the citadel, the geese raised a noisy alarm. The failure of the [[Guard dog|watch dogs]] to bark was thereafter ritually punished each year.

==Form of punishment==
The implement on which the dog was carried is called a ''furca'' by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (1st century AD), who describes it as made of [[sambucus|elder wood]],&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 29.57; [[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'' (Cornell University Press, 1981), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; and a ''crux'' by [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] (4th century).&lt;ref&gt;Servius, note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 8.652.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutarch]] uses a verbal form referring to a ''[[stauros]]'', "stake".&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''On the Fortune of the Romans'' 12: ἀνεσταυρωμένος ''(anestauromenos)''.&lt;/ref&gt; After [[crucifixion]] was banned by [[Constantine I]], the first [[Roman emperor|emperor]] to convert to Christianity, the ''furca'' replaced the ''crux'' in sentencing prescribed by the [[Digest (Roman law)|legal code]]. The ''furca'' had a Y shape.&lt;ref&gt;William A. Oldfather, "Livy i, 26 and the ''Supplicium de More Maiorum''," ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' 39 (1908), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''furca'' or ''palus'' ("stake")&lt;ref&gt;[[Isidore of Seville]] gives ''[[patibulum]]'' as a synonym for ''furca'' (''[[Etymologiae]]'' 5.27.33).&lt;/ref&gt; was a traditional instrument of punishment to which the condemned was bound for the ''supplicium de [[mos maiorum|more maiorum]]'' ("punishment according to ancestral custom"), a form of capital punishment by scourging. His hands were tied, and his head was veiled. The stake was originally a dead or barren tree, possibly a fruit tree, or an ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#arbor felix|arbor infelix]]'' ("unproductive tree" or "tree of ill fortune"),&lt;ref&gt;Oldfather, "Livy and the ''Supplicium''," pp. 69–70, with comparison to the ''supplicia canum''.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the several species regarded as under the guardianship ''([[tutela]])'' of the gods below ''([[di inferi]])''. The ''arbores infelices'' included trees and shrubs bearing black berries or fruit, as does the elder.&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' 3.20: ''quaeque bacam nigram nigrosque fructus ferunt''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The punishment ''de more maiorum'' was distinct from crucifixion, which was reserved for [[slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]] in the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Rawson]], "Sallust on the Eighties?" ''Classical Quarterly'' 37.1 (1987), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Scourging at the stake was a sentence for treason ''([[perduellio]])'' and for committing a sex crime ''([[stuprum]])'' against or with one of the [[Vestal Virgins|Vestals]], who were the only women subject to this punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Oldfather, "Livy and the ''Supplicium''," pp. 66–69.&lt;/ref&gt; It lapsed into disuse during the late Republic of the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, but was revived during the [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]], when people of [[Roman Empire#Unequal justice|higher social status were exempt]] from it.&lt;ref&gt;Oldfather, "Livy and the ''Supplicium''," p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[defixio|Binding]] and striking probably had a religious dimension, present also in other Roman rituals such as the [[Lupercalia]], when youths clad in goatskins ran through the streets flailing bystanders with leather thongs from sacrificed goats and dogs, and the [[Mamuralia]], for which a [[scapegoat]] figure was beaten with sticks. Although the dogs are not said to have been beaten, the ''supplicia canum'' shares some elements with the traditional punishment at the stake, and with the punishment [[Tiberius]] administered in the [[Africa (Roman province)|province of Africa]] to priests of the Carthaginian god identified with the Roman [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], usually regarded as [[Baal-hamon|Baal]]. In retribution for their ancestral custom of [[child sacrifice]] (whether or not such sacrifices actually occurred), Tiberius had them crucified on trees in their own temple precinct as offerings.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''Apologeticum'' 9.2; Oldfather, "Livy and the ''Supplicium''," p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ritual topography==
&lt;!--how is this topography?--&gt;The procession route involved the temples of [[Juventas]] ("Youth") and [[Summanus]], an obscure and complex [[di inferi|chthonic god]] of archaic Roman religion who shares some attributes with both [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]. It may have taken place in the [[Circus Maximus]].&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies,'' p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myth of origin==
Sources mentioning the ritual agree that the "punishment" was inflicted on the dogs for their failure to warn the Romans of the stealth attack against the [[arx (Roman)|citadel]] by the [[Gauls]] during the [[Gallic siege of Rome]] in 390 BC (or 387). Legends vary regarding this historical event—the only sack of the city during the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]]—but in the sources that allude to the ''supplicia canum'', temple geese are said to have raised the alarm instead. [[Plutarch]] and [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] rationalize the dogs' failure by explaining that the Gauls fed the siege-starved dogs and silenced them, while the geese called out excitedly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''On the Fortune of the Romans'' 12; [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''De natura animalium'' 12.33.&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of this service, for the ''supplicia'' procession geese were decked out in purple and gold, then carried on a [[litter (vehicle)|litter]].&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies'', p. 170 (described by Plutarch and Servius).&lt;/ref&gt; The August 3 date, however, is hard to account for within the traditional chronology that had the Gauls setting fire to the city on July 19 and maintaining a siege through February.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Horsfall, "From History to Legend: M. Manlius and the Geese," ''Classical Journal'' 76.4 (1981), p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bronze goose Musei Capitolini MC1169.jpg|thumb|left|Roman Imperial [[bronze]] goose ''([[Capitoline Museums]])'']]

In some stories, [[Marcus Manlius Capitolinus]] led the way in responding to the alarm, warding off the first Gaul to reach the top of the Capitoline cliff, or alternatively expelling them from the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Temple of Jupiter]], which they had entered through tunnels. Manlius is described once as a ''custos'', "guard" of the citadel, perhaps in command of the ''iuventus'', the young warriors as a collective.&lt;ref&gt;[[T.P. Wiseman]], "Topography and Rhetoric: The Trial of Manlius," ''Historia'' 28.1 (1979), pp. 40 and 48, citing [[Florus]] 1.7.13, and ''De viris illustribus'' 23.9 and 24.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Two or three years later, however, Manlius had attempted to capitalize on his reputation for heroism and to establish himself as a king or ''[[tyrannos]]'', a much-despised role in Republican Rome. He was accused of treason,&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, pp. 45–46, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; and in one source, was sentenced to be beaten to death ''de more maiorum''.&lt;ref&gt;Oldfather, "Livy and the ''Supplicium''," p. 68, citing the version of Nepos, frg. 5, as preserved by [[Aulus Gellius]] 17.21.24, in contrast to the version given by Livy 6.20.12. See also Wiseman, pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman narrative traditions regarding the Gallic siege are complex, "a hopeless jumble of aetiological tales, family [[apologia]]s, doublets, and transferences from Greek history",&lt;ref&gt;Horsfall, "From History to Legend," p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; including an improbable last-minute victory or at least the holding of the citadel itself, thanks to the geese. Some scholars have suspected that the citadel was breached and that the Romans ameliorated the disaster with layers of legend over time. The incongruity of Manlius's legendary heroism and his execution for treason a relatively short time later could conceal a military disgrace.&lt;ref&gt;Horsfall, "From History to Legend," pp. 298, 306ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The crucified dogs may originally have been intended to serve as a ''[[pharmakos]]'' or scapegoat.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Edward Burriss, "The Place of the Dog in Superstition as Revealed in Latin Literature," ''Classical Philology'' 30.1 (1935), pp. 36, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian writers [[Arnobius]] and [[Ambrose]] indicate that geese and dogs were kept on the Capitoline well into the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Horsfall, "From History to Legend," p. 308. Arnobius (''Adversus nationes'' 6.20) says that geese and dogs are still kept on the Capitoline, without referring to a specific ceremony; Ambrose (''Hexameron'' 5.13.44) says that geese are kept in state and receive sacrifices, without specific reference to the dogs.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Dogs, or parts of a dog's body, held numerous magical and medical powers in Greco-Roman belief,&lt;ref&gt;Burriss, "The Place of the Dog in Superstition," p 39ff.&lt;/ref&gt; but were regarded in Roman religion with ambivalence. Dogs were companions to the household [[Lares]], but could not be touched or spoken of by the [[Flamen Dialis]], the high priest of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Jack L. Lennon, ''Pollution and Religion in Ancient Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 2014&lt;!--that's what the copyright page says--&gt;), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dog sacrifices were carried out in Rome also for the [[Robigalia]], a [[Roman festival|spring festival]] aimed at warding off crop diseases. The ''augurium canarium'' ("dog augury"), which involved both [[augur]]s and the [[College of Pontiffs|state priests]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerzy Linderski]], "The Augural Law", ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.16 (1986), p. 2222.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[moveable feast]] in response to the rising of the Dogstar, [[Sirius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Elaine Fantham]], ''Ovid: Fasti, Book IV'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; Festivals in August following the ''supplicia canum'' deal with themes of agricultural bounty ensured by sun and water, centering on the [[Volcanalia]] of [[Volcanus]] (Vulcan) August 23.&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Boin]], ''Ostia in Late Antiquity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2013), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dog sacrifice is found among other [[ancient Italic peoples|Italic peoples]]. According to the [[Iguvine Tablets]], [[Oscans]] sacrificed an unblemished dog or puppy to the chthonic ''Hondus Jovius'': it was butchered, and certain parts roasted on spits, with remains left after the sacrifice buried at the altar.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick J. Simoons, ''Eat Not this Flesh: Food Avoidances from Prehistory to the Present'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 1994, 2nd ed.), p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;  No mention is made of disposal after the ''supplicia canum''. The Romans typically sacrificed domestic animals that were a normal part of their diet, and shared the meat in a communal meal. Victims such as dogs were considered inedible, as was the [[October Horse]] offered to [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], and were usually consumed in a [[holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust]] for deities whose spheres of influence pertained to the cycle of birth and death, such as [[Hecate]] and [[Mana Genita]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Bennett Pascal, "October Horse," ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 85 (1981), p. 277; [[John Scheid]], "Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', pp. 267–268; [[Robert Parker (historian)|Robert Parker]], ''On Greek Religion'' (Cornell University Press, 2011), pp. 158–159.&lt;/ref&gt;
