The '''Wall Street Crash of 1929''', also known as the '''Great Crash''', was a major American [[stock market crash]] that occurred in the fall of 1929. It started in September and ended late in October, when share prices on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] collapsed.

It was the most devastating stock market crash in the [[history of the United States]], when taking into consideration the full extent and duration of its aftereffects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/money/reader_guides/article6250577.ece|title=The beginner's guide to stock markets|work=[[The Times]]|quote=The most savage bear market of all time was the Wall Street Crash of 1929–1932, in which share prices fell by 89 percent. | location=London|accessdate=January 29, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525124235/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/money/reader_guides/article6250577.ece|archivedate=May 25, 2010|first=James|last=Bone}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crash, which followed the [[London Stock Exchange]]'s crash of September, signaled the beginning of the [[Great Depression]].

==Background==
[[File:1929 wall street crash graph.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]], 1928–1930]]
The "[[Roaring Twenties]]", the decade following [[World War I]] that led to the crash,&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article3602690.ece "America gets depressed by thoughts of 1929 revisited"] ''The Sunday Times''&lt;/ref&gt; was a time of wealth and excess. Building on post-war optimism, rural Americans migrated to the cities in vast numbers throughout the decade with the hopes of finding a more prosperous life in the ever-growing expansion of America's industrial sector.&lt;ref name=farmdep&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhistoryusa.com/great-farm-depression-1920s/|title=The Great (Farm) Depression of the 1920s|author=Dan Bryan|publisher=American History USA|accessdate=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While American cities prospered, however, the [[overproduction]] of agricultural produce created widespread financial despair among American farmers throughout the decade,&lt;ref name=farmdep /&gt; which was later blamed as one of the key factors that led to the 1929 stock market crash.&lt;ref&gt;http://millercenter.org/president/coolidge/essays/biography/8  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105061129/http://millercenter.org/president/coolidge/essays/biography/8 |date=November 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the dangers of [[speculation]], it was widely believed that the stock market would continue to rise forever: on March 25, 1929, after the [[Federal Reserve]] warned of excessive speculation, a small crash occurred as investors started to sell stocks at a rapid pace, exposing the market's shaky foundation.&lt;ref name=pbsstock /&gt; Two days later, banker [[Charles E. Mitchell]] announced that his company, the [[National City Bank (New York City)|National City Bank]], would provide $25 million in credit to stop the market's slide.&lt;ref name=pbsstock /&gt; Mitchell's move brought a temporary halt to the financial crisis, and [[call money]] declined from 20 to 8 percent.&lt;ref name=pbsstock /&gt; However, the American economy showed ominous signs of trouble:&lt;ref name=pbsstock /&gt; steel production declined, construction was sluggish, automobile sales went down, and consumers were building up high debts because of easy credit.&lt;ref name=pbsstock /&gt; 

Despite all the economic warning signs and the market breaks in March and May 1929, stocks resumed their advance in June and the gains continued almost unabated until early September 1929 (the Dow Jones average gained more than 20% between June and September). The market had been on a nine-year run that saw the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] increase in value tenfold, peaking at 381.17 on September 3, 1929.&lt;ref name=pbsstock&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/crash/timeline/timeline2.html|title=Timeline: A selected Wall Street chronology|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|accessdate=September 30, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923040829/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/crash/timeline/timeline2.html|archive-date=September 23, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the crash, economist [[Irving Fisher]] famously proclaimed "Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/9059304/c_9064230 |title=The Bright Side of Bubbles|author=Teach, Edward|work=[[CFO (magazine)|CFO]]|date=May 1, 2007 |accessdate=October 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The optimism and the financial gains of the great [[bull market]] were shaken after a well-publicized early September prediction from financial expert [[Roger Babson]] that "a crash is coming, and it may be terrific".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John Kenneth |last=Galbraith |title=The Great Crash, 1929 |location= |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=1997 |page=[https://archive.org/details/greatcrash19290000galb/page/84 84] |isbn=0-395-85999-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/greatcrash19290000galb/page/84 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial September decline was thus called the "Babson Break" in the press. That was the start of the Great Crash, but until the severe phase of the crash in October, many investors regarded the September "Babson Break" as a "healthy correction" and buying opportunity.

On September 20, the [[London Stock Exchange]] crashed when top British investor [[Clarence Hatry]] and many of his associates were jailed for fraud and forgery.&lt;ref name=hatrycrash&gt;{{cite book|title=The Causes of the 1929 Stock Market Crash: A Speculative Orgy or a New Era?|author=Harold Bierman, Jr.|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|pages=[https://archive.org/details/causesof1929st00bier/page/19 19–29]|date=April 1998|ISBN=978-0-313-30629-7|url=https://archive.org/details/causesof1929st00bier/page/19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The London crash greatly weakened the optimism of American investment in markets overseas:&lt;ref name=hatrycrash/&gt; in the days leading up to the crash, the market was severely unstable. Periods of selling and high volumes were interspersed with brief periods of rising prices and recovery.

On October 24, "Black Thursday", the market lost 11 percent of its value at the opening bell on very heavy trading.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The huge volume meant that the report of prices on the [[ticker tape]] in brokerage offices around the nation was hours late and so investors had no idea what most stocks were actually trading for. Several leading [[Wall Street]] [[banker]]s met to find a solution to the panic and chaos on the trading floor.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Depression'', by Robert Goldston, pages 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting included [[Thomas W. Lamont]], acting head of [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.|Morgan Bank]]; [[Albert Wiggin]], head of the [[Chase National Bank]]; and [[Charles E. Mitchell]], president of the [[Citibank#History|National City Bank of New York]]. They chose [[Richard Whitney (financier)|Richard Whitney]], vice president of the Exchange, to act on their behalf.

With the bankers' financial resources behind him, Whitney placed a bid to purchase a large block of shares in [[U.S. Steel]] at a price well above the current market. As traders watched, Whitney then placed similar bids on other "[[blue chip (stock market)|blue chip]]" stocks. The tactic was similar to one that had ended the [[Panic of 1907]], and succeeded in halting the slide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered, closing with it down only 6.38 points for the day.

After a one-day recovery on October 30, when the Dow regained 28.40 points, or 12.34%, to close at 258.47, the market continued to fall, arriving at an interim bottom on November 13, 1929, with the Dow closing at 198.60. The market then recovered for several months, starting on November 14, with the Dow gaining 18.59 points to close at 217.28, and reaching a secondary closing peak ([[bear market]] rally) of 294.07 on April 17, 1930. The Dow then embarked on another, much longer, steady slide from April 1930 to July 8, 1932, when it closed at 41.22, its lowest level of the 20th century, concluding an 89.2% loss for the index in less than three years. &lt;ref&gt;According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Economic Data website, based on a monthly timeseries 1929 September – 1932 June, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 87.1% while the Cowles Commission and S&amp;P's all stock index lost 85.0%: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qj2m , https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qj2l.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning on March 15, 1933, and continuing through the rest of the 1930s, the Dow began to slowly regain the ground it had lost. The largest percentage increases of the Dow Jones occurred during the early and mid-1930s. In late 1937, there was a sharp dip in the stock market, but prices held well above the 1932 lows. The Dow Jones did not return to the peak closing of September 3, 1929, until November 23, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/q/ta?s=%5EDJI&amp;t=my&amp;l=on&amp;z=l&amp;q=l&amp;p=&amp;a=&amp;c= "DJIA 1929 to Present"], Yahoo!

==Aftermath==

In 1932, the [[Pecora Commission]] was established by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] to study the causes of the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-man-who-busted-the-banksters-932416/|title=The Man Who Busted the ‘Banksters’|last=King|first=Gilbert|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=May 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the U.S. Congress passed the [[1933 Banking Act|Glass–Steagall Act]] mandating a separation between [[commercial bank]]s, which take deposits and extend [[loan]]s, and [[investment bank]]s, which [[Underwriting|underwrite]], issue, and distribute [[stock]]s, [[bond (finance)|bonds]], and other [[security (finance)|securities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestreet.com/politics/glass-steagall-act-14929574|title=What Is The Glass-Steagall Act?|last=Reed|first=Eric|date=April 18, 2019|website=[[TheStreet.com]]|language=en|access-date=May 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the experience of the 1929 crash, stock markets around the world instituted measures to suspend trading in the event of rapid declines, claiming that the measures would prevent such panic sales. However, the one-day crash of [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]], October 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 22.6%, as well as [[2020_stock_market_crash#Black_Monday_II_(16_March)|Black Monday of March 16, 2020]] (-12.9%), were worse in percentage terms than any single day of the 1929 crash (although the combined 25% decline of October 28–29, 1929 was larger than that of October 19, 1987, and remains the worst two-day decline ever).&lt;!-- Is this still correct as of March 2020?--&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The End of Optimism?

===World War II===
The American mobilization for [[World War II]] at the end of 1941 moved approximately ten million people out of the civilian labor force and into the war.&lt;ref&gt;Selective Service System.

==Analysis==
The crash followed a [[speculation|speculative]] boom that had taken hold in the late 1920s. During the latter half of the 1920s, steel production, building construction, retail turnover, automobiles registered, and even railway receipts advanced from record to record. The combined net profits of 536 manufacturing and trading companies showed an increase, in the first six months of 1929, of 36.6% over 1928, itself a record half-year. Iron and steel led the way with doubled gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article85141129|title=Broad Facts of, USA Crisis|first=Edward|last=Shann|authorlink=Edward Shann|newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|The Daily News]]|location=Perth, Western Australia|date=November 1, 1929|accessdate=November 22, 2012|page=6 (Edition: Home Final Edition)|via=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such figures set up a crescendo of stock-exchange speculation that led hundreds of thousands of Americans to invest heavily in the stock market. A significant number of them were [[Leverage (finance)|borrowing money]] to buy more stocks. By August 1929, brokers were routinely lending small investors more than two-thirds of the face value of the stocks they were buying. Over $8.5 billion was out on loan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7173bb6a-552a-11dd-ae9c-000077b07658.html|title=Crashes, Bangs &amp; Wallops|last=Lambert|first=Richard|date=July 19, 2008|work=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=September 30, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003034410/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7173bb6a-552a-11dd-ae9c-000077b07658.html|archive-date=October 3, 2008|url-status=dead|quote=At the turn of the 20th century stock market speculation was restricted to professionals, but the 1920s saw millions of 'ordinary Americans' investing in the New York Stock Exchange.

The rising share prices encouraged more people to invest, hoping the share prices would rise further. Speculation thus fueled further rises and created an [[economic bubble]]. Because of [[margin buying]], investors stood to lose large sums of money if the market turned down—or even failed to advance quickly enough.

Good harvests had built up a mass of 250 million bushels of wheat to be "carried over" when 1929 opened. By May there was also a winter-wheat crop of 560 million bushels ready for harvest in the Mississippi Valley. This oversupply caused a drop in wheat prices so heavy that the net incomes of the farming population from wheat were threatened with extinction. Stock markets are always sensitive to the future state of commodity markets {{citation needed|date=January 2019}}, and the slump in Wall Street predicted for May by Sir [[George Paish]] arrived on time. In June 1929, the position was saved by a severe drought in the Dakotas and the Canadian West, plus unfavorable seed times in Argentina and eastern Australia. The oversupply was now wanted to fill the gaps in the 1929 world wheat production. From 97¢ per bushel in May, the price of wheat rose to $1.49 in July. When it was seen that at this figure American farmers would get more for their crop than for that of 1928, stocks went up again.{{cn|date=October 2019}}

In August, the wheat price fell when France and Italy were bragging of a magnificent harvest, and the situation in Australia improved. That sent a shiver through Wall Street and stock prices quickly dropped, but word of cheap stocks brought a fresh rush of "stags", amateur speculators and investors. Congress voted for a $100 million relief package for the farmers, hoping to stabilize wheat prices. By October though, the price had fallen to $1.31 per bushel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article21480897|title=Grain Plunges|newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]]|location=Brisbane, Qld|date=October 26, 1929|accessdate=November 22, 2012|page=19|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important economic barometers were also slowing or even falling by mid-1929, including car sales, house sales, and steel production. The falling commodity and industrial production may have dented even American self-confidence, and the stock market peaked on September 3 at 381.17 just after Labor Day, then started to falter after [[Roger Babson]] issued his prescient "market crash" forecast. By the end of September, the market was down 10% from the peak (the "Babson Break"). Selling intensified in early and mid October, with sharp down days punctuated by a few up days. [[Panic selling]] on huge volume started the week of October 21 and intensified and culminated on October 24, the 28th, and especially the 29th ("Black Tuesday").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16596498|title=Wild Selling.

The president of the Chase National Bank, [[Albert H. Wiggin]], said at the time:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We are reaping the natural fruit of the orgy of speculation in which millions of people have indulged. It was inevitable, because of the tremendous increase in the number of stockholders in recent years, that the number of sellers would be greater than ever when the boom ended and selling took the place of buying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16597217|title=Second Crash|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|location=Sydney, NSW|date=October 30, 1929|accessdate=November 20, 2012|page=17|publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Insider trading law, ethics, and reform|last=Anderson, John P. |page=26|isbn=9781316603406|oclc=1048586916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together, the 1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression formed the largest financial crisis of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/aug/11/paulson-affirms-bush-assessment/ "Paulson affirms Bush assessment"], ''The Washington Times''&lt;/ref&gt; The panic of October 1929 has come to serve as a symbol of the economic contraction that gripped the world during the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Albert |last=Scardino |authorlink= |title=The Market Turmoil: Past lessons, present advice; Did '29 Crash Spark The Depression? |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DC1F3BF932A15753C1A961948260 |work=The New York Times |publisher= |date=October 21, 1987 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The falls in share prices on October 24 and 29, 1929 were practically instantaneous in all financial markets, except Japan.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7173bb6a-552a-11dd-ae9c-000077b07658.html "Crashes, Bangs &amp; Wallops"] ''Financial Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wall Street Crash had a major impact on the U.S. and world economy, and it has been the source of intense academic historical, economic, and political debate from its aftermath until the present day. Some people believed that abuses by utility holding companies contributed to the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Depression that followed.&lt;ref name="timesonline1"&gt;Jameson, Angela (August 10, 2005),[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/utilities/article553657.ece "Pyramid structures brought down by Wall Street Crash"] ''[[The Times]]'', Retrieved March 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Many people blamed the crash on commercial banks that were too eager to put deposits at risk on the stock market.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94894707 "Death of the Brokerage: The Future of Wall Street"] National Public Radio&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, 1,352 banks held more than $853 million in deposits; in 1931, one year later, 2,294 banks went down with nearly $1.7 billion in deposits. Many businesses failed (28,285 failures and a daily rate of 133 in 1931).

The 1929 crash brought the [[Roaring Twenties]] to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4795052.ece "Kaboom!...and bust. The crash of 2008"] ''The Times''&lt;/ref&gt; As tentatively expressed by economic historian [[Charles P. Kindleberger]], in 1929, there was no [[lender of last resort]] effectively present, which, if it had existed and been properly exercised, would have been key in shortening the business slowdown that normally follows financial crises.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; The crash instigated widespread and long-lasting consequences for the United States. Historians still debate whether the 1929 crash sparked the Great Depression&lt;ref name="nytimes2"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DC1F3BF932A15753C1A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 "The Market Turmoil: Past lessons, present advice; Did '29 Crash Spark The Depression?"] ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; or if it merely coincided with the bursting of a loose credit-inspired economic bubble. Only 16% of American households were invested in the stock market within the United States during the period leading up to this depression, suggesting that the crash carried somewhat less of a weight in causing it.{{cn|date=October 2019}}

[[File:UnemployedMarch.jpg|thumb|upright|Unemployed men march in [[Toronto]]]]
However, the psychological effects of the crash reverberated across the nation as businesses became aware of the difficulties in securing capital market investments for new projects and expansions. Business uncertainty naturally affects job security for employees, and as the American worker (the consumer) faced uncertainty with regards to income, naturally the propensity to consume declined. The decline in stock prices caused [[bankruptcies]] and severe [[macroeconomic]] difficulties, including contraction of credit, business closures, firing of workers, bank failures, decline of the money supply, and other economically depressing events.{{cn|date=October 2019}}

The resultant rise of mass unemployment is seen as a result of the crash, although the crash is by no means the sole event that contributed to the depression. The Wall Street Crash is usually seen as having the greatest impact on the events that followed and therefore is widely regarded as signaling the downward economic slide that initiated the Great Depression. True or not, the consequences were dire for almost everybody. Most academic experts agree on one aspect of the crash: It wiped out billions of dollars of wealth in one day, and this immediately depressed consumer buying.&lt;ref name="nytimes2" /&gt;

The failure set off a worldwide run on US gold deposits (i.e. the dollar), and forced the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates into the slump. Some 4,000 banks and other lenders ultimately failed. Also, the [[uptick rule]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0e317d72-86ac-11dd-959e-0000779fd18c.html "Practice has plenty of historical precedents"] ''Financial Times''&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed short selling only when the last tick in a stock's price was positive, was implemented after the 1929 market crash to prevent short sellers from driving the price of a stock down in a [[bear raid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0362e760-8b24-11dd-b634-0000779fd18c,s01=1.html "Funds want 'uptick' rule back"] ''Financial Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
The stock market crash of October 1929 led directly to the Great Depression in Europe. When stocks plummeted on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], the world noticed immediately. Although financial leaders in the United Kingdom, as in the United States, vastly underestimated the extent of the crisis that ensued, it soon became clear that the world's economies were more interconnected than ever. The effects of the disruption to the global system of financing, trade, and production and the subsequent meltdown of the [[Economy of the United States|American economy]] were soon felt throughout Europe.&lt;ref name=VT&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhr.history.vt.edu/modules/eu/mod04_depression/context.html|title=Digital History Reader – European History – Module 04: The End of Optimism? The Great Depression in Europe|publisher=[[Virginia Tech]]|access-date=November 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 and 1931, in particular, unemployed workers went on strike, demonstrated in public, and otherwise took direct action to call public attention to their plight. Within the UK, protests often focused on the so-called [[Means Test]], which the government had instituted in 1931 to limit the amount of unemployment payments made to individuals and families. For working people, the Means Test seemed an intrusive and insensitive way to deal with the chronic and relentless deprivation caused by the economic crisis. The strikes were met forcefully, with police breaking up protests, arresting demonstrators, and charging them with crimes related to the violation of public order.&lt;ref name=VT /&gt;

==Academic debate==
There is ongoing debate among economists and historians as to what role the crash played in subsequent economic, social, and political events. ''[[The Economist]]'' argued in a 1998 article that the Depression did not start with the stock market crash,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_TGVSDT "Economics focus: The Great Depression"], ''The Economist'' (September 17, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; nor was it clear at the time of the crash that a depression was starting. They asked, "Can a very serious Stock Exchange collapse produce a serious setback to industry when industrial production is for the most part in a healthy and balanced condition?" They argued that there must be some setback, but there was not yet sufficient evidence to prove that it would be long or would necessarily produce a general industrial depression.&lt;ref name="Nov1929"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12327393 "Reactions of the Wall Street slump"], ''The Economist'' (November 23, 1929)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, ''The Economist'' also cautioned that some bank failures were also to be expected and some banks may not have had any reserves left for financing commercial and industrial enterprises. It concluded that the position of the banks was the key to the situation, but what was going to happen could not have been foreseen.&lt;ref name="Nov1929" /&gt;

Some academics view the Wall Street Crash of 1929 as part of a historical process that was a part of the new theories of [[boom and bust]]. According to economists such as [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Nikolai Kondratiev]] and [[Charles E. Mitchell]], the crash was merely a historical event in the continuing process known as [[Business cycle|economic cycles]]. The impact of the crash was merely to increase the speed at which the cycle proceeded to its next level.

[[Milton Friedman]]'s ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'', co-written with [[Anna Schwartz]], argues that what made the "great contraction" so severe was not the downturn in the business cycle, [[protectionism]], or the 1929 stock market crash in themselves but the collapse of the banking system during three waves of panics from 1930 to 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/may/12/panic-control/ "Panic control"] ''The Washington Times''&lt;/ref&gt;
