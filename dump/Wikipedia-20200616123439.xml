{{Maya civilization}}
The '''Maya civilization''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|aɪ|ə}}) was a [[Mesoamerica]]n [[civilization]] developed by the [[Maya peoples]], and noted for its [[Maya script|logosyllabic script]]—the most sophisticated and highly developed [[writing system]] in [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Americas]]—as well as for its [[Maya art|art]], [[Maya architecture|architecture]], [[Maya numerals|mathematics]], [[Maya calendar|calendar]], and [[Maya astronomy|astronomical]] system. The Maya civilization developed in an area that encompasses southeastern [[Mexico]], all of [[Guatemala]] and [[Belize]], and the western portions of [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]]. This region consists of the northern lowlands encompassing the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], and the highlands of the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas|Sierra Madre]], running from the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]], across southern [[Guatemala]] and onwards into El Salvador, and the southern lowlands of the Pacific littoral plain. The overarching term "Maya" is a modern collective term that refers to the peoples of the region, however, the term was not used by the indigenous populations themselves since there never was a common sense of identity or political unity among the distinct populations.&lt;ref&gt;Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mesoamerican chronology#Archaic Era|Archaic period]], prior to 2000 BC, saw the first developments in agriculture and the earliest villages. The Preclassic period ({{circa|2000 BC to 250 AD}}) saw the establishment of the first complex societies in the Maya region, and the cultivation of the staple crops of the [[Maya cuisine|Maya diet]], including [[maize]], [[Phaseolus vulgaris|beans]], [[Cucurbita|squashes]], and [[chili pepper]]s. The first [[Maya city|Maya cities]] developed around 750 BC, and by 500 BC these cities possessed monumental architecture, including large temples with elaborate [[stucco]] façades. Hieroglyphic writing was being used in the Maya region by the 3rd century BC. In the Late Preclassic a number of large cities developed in the [[Petén Basin]], and the city of [[Kaminaljuyu]] rose to prominence in the [[Guatemalan Highlands]]. Beginning around 250 AD, the Classic period is largely defined as when the Maya were raising sculpted monuments with [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|Long Count dates]]. This period saw the Maya civilization develop many [[city-state]]s linked by a complex [[Trade in Maya civilization|trade network]]. In the Maya Lowlands two great rivals, the cities of [[Tikal]] and [[Calakmul]], became powerful. The Classic period also saw the intrusive intervention of the central Mexican city of [[Teotihuacan]] in Maya dynastic politics. In the 9th century, there was a widespread [[Classic Maya collapse|political collapse]] in the central Maya region, resulting in [[internecine war]]fare, the abandonment of cities, and a northward shift of population. The Postclassic period saw the rise of [[Chichen Itza]] in the north, and the expansion of the aggressive [[Kʼicheʼ kingdom of Qʼumarkaj|Kʼicheʼ kingdom]] in the Guatemalan Highlands. In the 16th century, the [[Spanish Empire]] colonised the Mesoamerican region, and a lengthy series of campaigns saw the fall of [[Nojpetén]], the last Maya city, in 1697.

Classic period rule was centred on the concept of the "divine king", who acted as a mediator between mortals and the supernatural realm. Kingship was [[patrilineal]], and power would normally [[primogeniture|pass to the eldest son]]. A prospective king was also expected to be a successful war leader. Maya politics was dominated by a closed system of patronage, although the exact political make-up of a kingdom varied from city-state to city-state. By the Late Classic, the aristocracy had greatly increased, resulting in the corresponding reduction in the exclusive power of the divine king. The Maya civilization developed highly sophisticated artforms, and the Maya created art using both perishable and non-perishable materials, including wood, [[jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]], [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]], [[Maya ceramics|ceramics]], sculpted stone monuments, stucco, and finely painted murals.

Maya cities tended to expand haphazardly, and the city centre would be occupied by ceremonial and administrative complexes, surrounded by an irregular sprawl of residential districts. Different parts of a city would often be linked by [[sacbe|causeways]]. The principal architecture of the city consisted of palaces, [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramid-temples]], [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ceremonial ballcourts]], and structures aligned for astronomical observation. The Maya elite were literate, and developed a complex system of hieroglyphic writing that was the most advanced in the pre-Columbian Americas. The Maya recorded their history and ritual knowledge in screenfold books, of which only three uncontested examples remain, the rest having been destroyed by the Spanish. There are also a great many examples of Maya text found on [[Maya stelae|stelae]] and ceramics. The Maya developed a highly complex series of interlocking ritual calendars, and employed mathematics that included one of the earliest instances of the [[0 (number)|explicit zero]] in the world. As a part of their religion, the Maya practised [[human sacrifice in Maya culture|human sacrifice]].

==Mesoamerica==
{{main|Mesoamerica}}
[[File:Mayamap.png|thumb|right|The Maya area within [[Mesoamerica]]]]
The Maya civilization developed within the Mesoamerican cultural area, which covers a region that spreads from northern Mexico southwards into Central America.&lt;ref name="Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 28"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Mesoamerica was one of six [[cradle of civilization|cradles of civilization]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenwig 2010, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mesoamerican area gave rise to a series of cultural developments that included [[complex society|complex societies]], [[agriculture in Mesoamerica|agriculture]], cities, [[Mesoamerican architecture|monumental architecture]], [[Mesoamerican writing systems|writing]], and [[Mesoamerican calendars|calendrical systems]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; The set of traits shared by Mesoamerican cultures also included [[Mesoamerican astronomy|astronomical knowledge]], [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|blood]] and [[human sacrifice]], and a [[Mesoamerican mythology|cosmovision]] that viewed the world as divided into four divisions aligned with the [[cardinal direction]]s, each with different attributes, and a three-way division of the world into the celestial realm, the earth, and the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 6000 BC, the early inhabitants of Mesoamerica were experimenting with the domestication of plants, a process that eventually led to the establishment of [[sedentism|sedentary]] [[agrarian society|agricultural societies]].&lt;ref&gt;Blanton et al. 1993, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The diverse climate allowed for wide variation in available crops, but all regions of Mesoamerica cultivated the base crops of maize, beans, and squashes.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2005, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; All Mesoamerican cultures used [[Prehistoric technology|Stone Age technology]]; after c. 1000 AD [[Metallurgy in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica|copper, silver and gold]] were worked. Mesoamerica lacked [[draft animals]], did not use the wheel, and possessed few domesticated animals; the principal means of transport was on foot or by canoe.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2005, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
Mesoamericans viewed the world as hostile and governed by unpredictable deities. The [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ritual Mesoamerican ballgame]] was widely played.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2005, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Mesoamerica is linguistically diverse, with most [[Mesoamerican languages|languages]] falling within a small number of [[language family|language families]]—the major families are [[Mayan languages|Mayan]], [[Mixe–Zoque languages|Mixe–Zoquean]], [[Oto-Manguean languages|Otomanguean]], and [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]]; there are also a number of smaller families and [[language isolate|isolates]]. The Mesoamerican [[language area]] shares a number of important features, including widespread [[loanword]]s, and use of a [[vigesimal]] number system.&lt;ref&gt;Witschey and Brown 2012, pp. 183–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The territory of the Maya covered a third of Mesoamerica,&lt;ref name="Foster02p5"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Maya were engaged in a dynamic relationship with neighbouring cultures that included the [[Olmec]]s, [[Mixtec]]s, Teotihuacan, the [[Aztec]]s, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 29. Foster 2002, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Early Classic period, the Maya cities of Tikal and Kaminaljuyu were key Maya foci in a network that extended beyond the Maya area into the highlands of central Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus 2004b, pp. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; At around the same time, there was a strong Maya presence at the Tetitla compound of Teotihuacan.&lt;ref&gt;Taube 2004, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; Centuries later, during the 9th century AD, murals at [[Cacaxtla]], another site in the central Mexican highlands, were painted in a Maya style.&lt;ref&gt;McVicker 1985, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been either an effort to align itself with the still-powerful Maya area after the collapse of Teotihuacan and ensuing political fragmentation in the Mexican Highlands,&lt;ref&gt;Brittenham 2009, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; or an attempt to express a distant Maya origin of the inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo 1989, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maya city of Chichen Itza and the distant [[Toltec]] capital of [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]] had an especially [[Maya-Toltec controversy at Chichen Itza|close relationship]].&lt;ref&gt;Kristan-Graham and Kowalski 2007, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Maya civilization location map - geography.svg|thumb|Maya area]]
The Maya civilization occupied a wide territory that included southeastern Mexico and northern Central America. This area included the entire Yucatán Peninsula and all of the territory now incorporated into the modern countries of Guatemala and Belize, as well as the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p26"/&gt; Most of the peninsula is formed by a vast plain with few hills or mountains and a generally low coastline.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1966, p. 25"&gt;Thompson 1966, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Petén region consists of densely forested low-lying limestone plain;&lt;ref&gt;Lovell 2005, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; a chain of fourteen lakes runs across the central drainage basin of Petén.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; To the south the plain gradually rises towards the Guatemalan Highlands.&lt;ref&gt;Rice and Rice 2009, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Dense forest covers northern Petén and Belize, most of [[Quintana Roo]], southern [[Campeche]], and a portion of the south of [[Yucatán]] state. Farther north, the vegetation turns to lower forest consisting of dense scrub.&lt;ref&gt;Quezada 2011, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[littoral zone]] of [[Soconusco]] lies to the south of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas,&lt;ref&gt;Lovell 2000, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt; and consists of a narrow coastal plain and the foothills of the Sierra Madre.&lt;ref&gt;Viqueira 2004, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maya highlands extend eastwards from Chiapas into Guatemala, reaching their highest in the [[Sierra de los Cuchumatanes]]. The major pre-Columbian population centres of the highlands were located in the largest highland valleys, such as the [[Valley of Guatemala]] and the [[Quetzaltenango]] Valley. In the southern highlands, a belt of volcanic cones runs parallel to the Pacific coast. The highlands extend northwards into [[Verapaz, Guatemala|Verapaz]], and gradually descend to the east.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of the Maya civilization}}
The history of Maya civilization is divided into three principal periods: the Preclassic, Classic, and Postclassic periods.&lt;ref&gt;Estrada-Belli 2011, pp. 1, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; These were preceded by the Archaic Period, during which the first settled villages and early developments in agriculture emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 98. Estrada-Belli 2011, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars regard these periods as arbitrary divisions of Maya chronology, rather than indicative of cultural evolution or decline.&lt;ref&gt;Estrada-Belli 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Definitions of the start and end dates of period spans can vary by as much as a century, depending on the author.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maya developed their first civilization in the Preclassic period.&lt;ref&gt;Estrada-Belli 2011, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars continue to discuss when this era of Maya civilization began. Maya occupation at [[Cuello]] (modern-day Belize) has been carbon dated to around 2600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond et al. 1976, pp. 579–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Settlements were established around 1800 BC in the Soconusco region of the Pacific coast, and the Maya were already cultivating the staple crops of maize, beans, squash, and chili pepper.&lt;ref name="Drew99p6"&gt;Drew 1999, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This period was characterised by [[sedentism|sedentary]] communities and the introduction of pottery and fired clay figurines.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Lidar]] survey of the newly discovered Aguada Fénix site at Tabasco, Mexico uncovered large structures suggested to be a ceremonial site dating from between 1000 and 800 BC. The 2020 report of the survey, in the journal Nature, suggests its use as a ceremonial observation of the winter and summer solstices, with associated festivities and social gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Inomata |first1=Takeshi |last2=Vázquez López |first2=V.A. |author2=|display-authors=etal |title=Monumental architecture at Aguada Fénix and the rise of Maya civilization. |journal=Nature |date=3 June 2020 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2343-4 |accessdate=3 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle Preclassic Period]], small villages began to grow to form cities.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p26"&gt;Olmedo Vera 1997, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nakbe]] in the Petén department of Guatemala is the earliest well-documented city in the Maya lowlands,&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p214"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; where large structures have been dated to around 750 BC.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p26"/&gt; The northern lowlands of Yucatán were widely settled by the Middle Preclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; By approximately 400&amp;nbsp;BC, early Maya rulers were raising stelae.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 182, 197.&lt;/ref&gt; A developed script was already being used in Petén by the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name="Saturno2006"&gt;Saturno, Stuart and Beltrán 2006, pp. 1281–83.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Late Preclassic Period, the enormous city of [[El Mirador]] grew to cover approximately {{convert|16|km2|sqmi}}.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p28"&gt;Olmedo Vera 1997, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not as large, Tikal was already a significant city by around 350 BC.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p25-26"&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the highlands, [[Kaminaljuyu]] emerged as a principal centre in the Late Preclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Love 2007, pp. 293, 297. Popenoe de Hatch and Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p. 991.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Takalik Abaj]] and [[Chocolá]] were two of the most important cities on the Pacific coastal plain,&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Komchen]] grew to become an important site in northern Yucatán.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; The Late Preclassic cultural florescence collapsed in the 1st century AD and many of the great Maya cities of the epoch were abandoned; the cause of this collapse is unknown.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p8"&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classic period (c. 250–900 AD)===
[[File:QuiriguaStela1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Stela D from [[Quiriguá]], representing king [[Kʼakʼ Tiliw Chan Yopaat]]&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Mathews 1999, pp. 179, 182–83.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Classic period is largely defined as the period during which the lowland Maya raised dated monuments using the Long Count calendar.&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p. 81"&gt;Coe 1999, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; This period marked the peak of large-scale construction and [[urbanism]], the recording of monumental inscriptions, and demonstrated significant intellectual and artistic development, particularly in the southern lowland regions.&lt;ref name="Coe 1999, p. 81"/&gt; The Classic period Maya political landscape has been likened to that of [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]] or [[Classical Greece]], with multiple city-states engaged in a complex network of alliances and enmities.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest cities had populations numbering 50,000 to 120,000 and were linked to networks of subsidiary sites.&lt;ref name="Masson 2012, p. 18237"/&gt;

During the Early Classic, cities throughout the Maya region were influenced by the great metropolis of [[Teotihuacan]] in the distant [[Valley of Mexico]].&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p9"&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 378, Teotihuacan decisively intervened at Tikal and other nearby cities, deposed their rulers, and installed a new Teotihuacan-backed dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 218. Estrada-Belli 2011, pp. 123–26.&lt;/ref&gt; This intervention was led by [[Siyaj Kʼakʼ]] ("Born of Fire"), who arrived at Tikal in early 378. The king of Tikal, [[Chak Tok Ichʼaak I]], died on the same day, suggesting a violent takeover.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 322. Martin and Grube 2000, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Siyaj Kʼakʼ oversaw the installation of a new king, [[Yax Nuun Ahiin I]].&lt;ref name="Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 324"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; The installation of the new dynasty led to a period of political dominance when Tikal became the most powerful city in the central lowlands.&lt;ref name="Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 324"/&gt;

Tikal's great rival was Calakmul, another powerful city in the Petén Basin.&lt;ref name="Olmeda97p36"&gt;Olmedo Vera 1997, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; Tikal and Calakmul both developed extensive systems of allies and vassals; lesser cities that entered one of these networks gained prestige from their association with the top-tier city, and maintained peaceful relations with other members of the same network.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Tikal and Calakmul engaged in the manoeuvering of their alliance networks against each other. At various points during the Classic period, one or other of these powers would gain a strategic victory over its great rival, resulting in respective periods of florescence and decline.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, pp. 224–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Calakmul - Structure I.jpg|thumb|left|[[Calakmul]] was one of the most important Classic period cities.]]

In 629, [[Bʼalaj Chan Kʼawiil]], a son of the Tikal king [[Kʼinich Muwaan Jol II]], was sent to found a new city at [[Dos Pilas]], in the [[Petexbatún Lake|Petexbatún]] region, apparently as an outpost to extend Tikal's power beyond the reach of Calakmul.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 383, 387.&lt;/ref&gt; For the next two decades he fought loyally for his brother and overlord at Tikal. In 648, king [[Yuknoom Chʼeen II|Yuknoom Chʼeen&amp;nbsp;II]] of Calakmul captured Balaj Chan Kʼawiil. Yuknoom Chʼeen&amp;nbsp;II then reinstated Balaj Chan Kʼawiil upon the throne of Dos&amp;nbsp;Pilas as his vassal.&lt;ref&gt;Salisbury, Koumenalis &amp; Barbara Moffett 2002.

In the southeast, [[Copán]] was the most important city.&lt;ref name="Olmeda97p36"/&gt; Its Classic-period dynasty was founded in 426 by [[Kʼinich Yax Kʼukʼ Moʼ]]. The new king had strong ties with central Petén and Teotihuacan.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 192–93. Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Copán reached the height of its cultural and artistic development during the rule of [[Uaxaclajuun Ubʼaah Kʼawiil]], who ruled from 695 to 738.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 200, 203.&lt;/ref&gt; His reign ended catastrophically when he was captured by his vassal, king [[Kʼakʼ Tiliw Chan Yopaat]] of [[Quiriguá]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, pp. 203, 205.&lt;/ref&gt; The captured lord of Copán was taken back to Quiriguá and was decapitated in a public ritual.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Miller 1999, pp. 134–35. Looper 2003, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that this coup was backed by Calakmul, in order to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 1999, pp. 81, 271.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Palenque]] and [[Yaxchilan]] were the most powerful cities in the [[Usumacinta River|Usumacinta]] region.&lt;ref name="Olmeda97p36"/&gt; In the highlands, Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala was already a sprawling city by 300.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In the north of the Maya area, [[Coba]] was the most important capital.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p554"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 554.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Classic Maya collapse====
{{Main|Classic Maya collapse}}
[[File:Chichen Itza ruins in Mexico -- by John Romkey.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chichen Itza]] was the most important city in the northern Maya region.]]
During the 9th century AD, the central Maya region suffered major political collapse, marked by the abandonment of cities, the ending of dynasties, and a northward shift in activity.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p9"/&gt; No universally accepted theory explains this collapse, but it likely had a combination of causes, including endemic internecine warfare, overpopulation resulting in severe [[land degradation|environmental degradation]], and [[drought]].&lt;ref name="coe"&gt;Coe 1999, pp. 151–55.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, known as the Terminal Classic, the northern cities of Chichen Itza and [[Uxmal]] showed increased activity.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p9"/&gt; Major cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula continued to be inhabited long after the cities of the southern lowlands ceased to raise monuments.&lt;ref&gt;Becker 2004, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Classic Maya social organization was based on the ritual authority of the ruler, rather than central control of trade and food distribution. This model of rulership was poorly structured to respond to changes, because the ruler's actions were limited by [[Traditional society|tradition]] to such activities as construction, ritual, and warfare. This only served to exacerbate [[systemic problem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 9th and 10th centuries, this resulted in collapse of this system of rulership. In the northern Yucatán, individual rule was replaced by a ruling council formed from elite lineages. In the southern Yucatán and central Petén, kingdoms declined; in western Petén and some other areas, the changes were catastrophic and resulted in the rapid depopulation of cities.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a couple of generations, large swathes of the central Maya area were all but abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the capitals and their secondary centres were generally abandoned within a period of 50 to 100 years.&lt;ref name="Masson 2012, p. 18237"&gt;Masson 2012, p. 18237.&lt;/ref&gt; One by one, cities stopped sculpting dated monuments; the last Long Count date was inscribed at [[Toniná]] in 909. Stelae were no longer raised, and squatters moved into abandoned royal palaces. Mesoamerican trade routes shifted and bypassed Petén.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postclassic period (c. 950–1539 AD)===
{{See also|League of Mayapan}}
[[File:Zacuelu2.jpg|thumb|[[Zaculeu]] was capital of the Postclassic [[Mam people|Mam]] kingdom in the [[Guatemalan Highlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer 2000, p. 490.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although much reduced, a significant Maya presence remained into the Postclassic period after the abandonment of the major Classic period cities; the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 613, 616.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike during previous cycles of contraction in the Maya region, abandoned lands were not quickly resettled in the Postclassic.&lt;ref name="Masson 2012, p. 18237"/&gt; Activity shifted to the northern lowlands and the Maya Highlands; this may have involved migration from the southern lowlands, because many Postclassic Maya groups had migration myths.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2014, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Chichen Itza and its [[Puuc]] neighbours declined dramatically in the 11th century, and this may represent the final episode of Classic Period collapse. After the decline of Chichen Itza, the Maya region lacked a dominant power until the rise of the city of [[Mayapan]] in the 12th century. New cities arose near the [[Caribbean]] and [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]] coasts, and new trade networks were formed.&lt;ref name="Masson2012p18238"/&gt;

The Postclassic Period was marked by changes from the preceding Classic Period.&lt;ref name="Arroyo01p38"&gt;Arroyo 2001, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The once-great city of Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala was abandoned after continuous occupation of almost 2,000 years.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p618"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 618.&lt;/ref&gt; Across the highlands and neighbouring Pacific coast, long-occupied cities in exposed locations were relocated, apparently due to a proliferation of [[Maya warfare|warfare]]. Cities came to occupy more-easily defended hilltop locations surrounded by deep ravines, with ditch-and-wall defences sometimes supplementing the protection provided by the natural terrain.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p618"/&gt; One of the most important cities in the Guatemalan Highlands at this time was [[Qʼumarkaj]], the capital of the aggressive [[Kʼicheʼ kingdom of Qʼumarkaj|Kʼicheʼ kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Arroyo01p38"/&gt; The government of Maya states, from the Yucatán to the Guatemalan highlands, was often organised as joint rule by a council. However, in practice one member of the council could act as a supreme ruler, while the other members served him as advisors.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2014, pp. 100–02.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mayapan chac.JPG|thumb|left|[[Mayapan]] was an important Postclassic city in the northern [[Yucatán Peninsula]].]]

Mayapan was abandoned around 1448, after a period of political, social and environmental turbulence that in many ways echoed the Classic period collapse in the [[Southern Maya area|southern Maya region]]. The abandonment of the city was followed by a period of prolonged warfare, disease and natural disasters in the Yucatán Peninsula, which ended only shortly before Spanish contact in 1511.&lt;ref&gt;Masson and Peraza Lope 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Even without a dominant regional capital, the early Spanish explorers reported wealthy coastal cities and thriving marketplaces.&lt;ref name="Masson2012p18238"&gt;Masson 2012, p. 18238.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Late Postclassic, the Yucatán Peninsula was divided into a number of independent provinces that shared a common culture but varied in internal sociopolitical organization.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews 1984, p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of the Spanish conquest, the highlands of Guatemala were dominated by several powerful Maya states.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 717.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kʼicheʼ people|Kʼicheʼ]] had carved out a small empire covering a large part of the western Guatemalan Highlands and the neighbouring Pacific coastal plain. However, in the decades before the Spanish invasion the [[Kaqchikel kingdom]] had been steadily eroding the kingdom of the Kʼicheʼ.&lt;ref&gt;Restall and Asselbergs 2007, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lienzo de Tlaxcala Iximche.gif|thumb|right|Page from the ''[[Lienzo de Tlaxcala]]'' showing the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|Spanish conquest]] of [[Iximche]], known as Cuahtemallan in the [[Nahuatl]] language]]
In 1511, a Spanish [[caravel]] was wrecked in the Caribbean, and about a dozen survivors made landfall on the coast of Yucatán. They were seized by a Maya lord, and most were [[Human sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrificed]], although two managed to escape. From 1517 to 1519, three separate Spanish expeditions explored the Yucatán coast, and engaged in a number of battles with the Maya inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 759–60.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Aztec capital [[Tenochtitlan]] fell to the Spanish in 1521, [[Hernán Cortés]] despatched [[Pedro de Alvarado]] to Guatemala with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, 4 cannons, and thousands of allied warriors from central Mexico;&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 763. Lovell 2005, p. 58. Matthew 2012, pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; they arrived in Soconusco in 1523.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 763.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kʼicheʼ capital, Qʼumarkaj, fell to Alvarado in 1524.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 764–65. Recinos 1986, pp. 68, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, the Spanish were invited as allies into [[Iximche]], the capital city of the Kaqchikel Maya.&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Mathews 1999, p. 297. Guillemín 1965, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Good relations did not last, due to excessive Spanish demands for gold as tribute, and the city was abandoned a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Mathews 1999, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the fall of [[Zaculeu]], the Mam Maya capital, in 1525.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1986, p. 110. del Águila Flores 2007, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francisco de Montejo]] and his son, [[Francisco de Montejo the Younger]], launched a long series of campaigns against the polities of the Yucatán Peninsula in 1527, and finally completed the conquest of the northern portion of the peninsula in 1546.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 766–72.&lt;/ref&gt; This left only the Maya kingdoms of the Petén Basin independent.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 772–73.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1697, [[Martín de Ursúa]] launched an assault on the [[Itza people|Itza]] capital [[Nojpetén]] and the last independent Maya city fell to the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1998, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persistence of Maya culture===
{{main|Maya peoples}}
The Spanish conquest stripped away most of the defining features of Maya civilization. However, many Maya villages remained remote from Spanish colonial authority, and for the most part continued to manage their own affairs. Maya communities and the nuclear family maintained their traditional day-to-day life.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic Mesoamerican diet of maize and beans continued, although agricultural output was improved by the introduction of steel tools. Traditional crafts such as weaving, ceramics, and basketry continued to be practised. Community markets and trade in local products continued long after the conquest. At times, the colonial administration encouraged the traditional economy in order to extract tribute in the form of ceramics or cotton textiles, although these were usually made to European specifications. Maya beliefs and language proved resistant to change, despite vigorous efforts by Catholic missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The 260-day ''[[tzolkʼin]]'' ritual calendar continues in use in modern Maya communities in the highlands of Guatemala and Chiapas,&lt;ref&gt;Zorich 2012, p. 29. Thompson 1932, p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt; and millions of Mayan-language speakers inhabit the territory in which their ancestors developed their civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation of Maya civilization===
[[File:Uxmal nunnery by Catherwood 02.jpg|thumb|right|Drawing by [[Frederick Catherwood]] of the Nunnery complex at [[Uxmal]]]]
The agents of the Catholic Church wrote detailed accounts of the Maya, in support of their efforts at evangelization, and absorption of the Maya into the Spanish Empire.&lt;ref name="Demarest04p31"&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by various Spanish priests and colonial officials who left descriptions of ruins they visited in Yucatán and Central America.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839, American traveller and writer [[John Lloyd Stephens]] set out to visit a number of Maya sites with English architect and draftsman [[Frederick Catherwood]].&lt;ref&gt;Koch 2013, pp. 1, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Their illustrated accounts of the ruins sparked strong popular interest, and brought the Maya to the attention of the world.&lt;ref name="Demarest04p31"/&gt; The later 19th century saw the recording and recovery of ethnohistoric accounts of the Maya, and the first steps in deciphering Maya hieroglyphs.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Castillo Maler.jpg|thumb|left|1892 photograph of the [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|Castillo]] at [[Chichen Itza]], by [[Teoberto Maler]]]]
The final two decades of the 19th century saw the birth of modern scientific archaeology in the Maya region, with the meticulous work of [[Alfred Maudslay]] and [[Teoberto Maler]].&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 20th century, the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]] was sponsoring excavations at Copán and in the Yucatán Peninsula.&lt;ref name="Demarest 2004, p. 38"&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first two decades of the 20th century, advances were made in deciphering the Maya calendar, and identifying deities, dates, and religious concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1930s, archaeological exploration increased dramatically, with large-scale excavations across the Maya region.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, the distinguished Mayanist [[J. Eric S. Thompson]] promoted the ideas that Maya cities were essentially vacant ceremonial centres serving a dispersed population in the forest, and that the Maya civilization was governed by peaceful astronomer-priests.&lt;ref name="Demarest 2004, p. 44"&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas began to collapse with major advances in the decipherment of the script in the late 20th century, pioneered by [[Heinrich Berlin]], [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]], and [[Yuri Knorozov]].&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; With breakthroughs in understanding of Maya script since the 1950s, the texts revealed the warlike activities of the Classic Maya kings, and the view of the Maya as peaceful could no longer be supported.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The capital of  [[Plan de Ayutla (Maya site)|Sak Tz’i’]] (an Ancient Maya kingdom) now named Lacanja Tzeltal, was revealed by researchers led by associate anthropology professor Charles Golden and bioarchaeologist Andrew Scherer in the [[Chiapas]] in the backyard of a Mexican farmer in 2020.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritagedaily.com/2020/03/archaeologists-discover-lost-capital-of-ancient-maya-kingdom/126361|title=Archaeologists discover lost capital of ancient Maya Kingdom|date=2020-03-12|website=HeritageDaily - Archaeology News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1254403/Archaeology-news-Ancient-Maya-kingdom-discovery-Mexico-cattle-ranch|title=Archaeology breakthrough: Ancient Maya kingdom discovered in... a rancher's backyard|last=Kettley|first=Sebastian|date=2020-03-13|website=Express.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city will continue to be inspected and scanned by archaeologists under thick forest canopy using [[Lidar|LIDAR]] technology (light detection and range) in June 2020.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Politics==
Unlike the [[Aztec]]s and the [[Inca Empire|Inca]], the Maya political system never integrated the entire Maya cultural area into a single state or empire. Rather, throughout its history, the Maya area contained a varying mix of political complexity that included both [[State (polity)|states]] and [[chiefdom]]s. These polities fluctuated greatly in their relationships with each other and were engaged in a complex web of rivalries, periods of dominance or submission, vassalage, and alliances. At times, different polities achieved regional dominance, such as Calakmul, [[Caracol]], Mayapan, and Tikal. The first reliably evidenced polities formed in the Maya lowlands in the 9th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Cioffi-Revilla and Landman 1999, p. 563.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Late Preclassic, the Maya political system coalesced into a [[theocracy|theopolitical]] form, where elite ideology justified the ruler's authority, and was reinforced by public display, ritual, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley and Rubin 2012, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The divine king was the centre of political power, exercising ultimate control over the administrative, economic, judicial, and military functions of the polity. The divine authority invested within the ruler was such that the king was able to mobilize both the aristocracy and commoners in executing huge infrastructure projects, apparently with no police force or standing army.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley and Rubin 2012, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Some polities engaged in a strategy of increasing administration, and filling administrative posts with loyal supporters rather than blood relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2014, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a polity, mid-ranking population centres would have played a key role in managing resources and internal conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2014, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maya political landscape was highly complex and Maya elites engaged in political intrigue to gain economic and social advantage over neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Chase and Chase 2012, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Late Classic, some cities established a long period of dominance over other large cities, such as the dominance of Caracol over [[Naranjo]] for half a century. In other cases, loose alliance networks were formed around a dominant city.&lt;ref&gt;Chase and Chase 2012, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; Border settlements, usually located about halfway between neighbouring capitals, often switched allegiance over the course of their history, and at times acted independently.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2014, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Dominant capitals exacted tribute in the form of luxury items from subjugated population centres.&lt;ref name="Foias14p161"/&gt; Political power was reinforced by military power, and the capture and humiliation of enemy warriors played an important part in elite culture. An overriding sense of pride and honour among the warrior aristocracy could lead to extended feuds and vendettas, which caused political instability and the fragmentation of polities.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2014, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society==
{{main|Maya society}}
{{see also|Women in Maya society}}
From the Early Preclassic, Maya society was sharply divided between the elite and commoners. As population increased over time, various sectors of society became increasingly specialised, and political organization became increasingly complex.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; By the Late Classic, when populations had grown enormously and hundreds of cities were connected in a complex web of political hierarchies, the wealthy segment of society multiplied.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, pp. 121–22.&lt;/ref&gt; A middle class may have developed that included artisans, low ranking [[Maya priesthood|priests]] and officials, merchants, and soldiers. Commoners included farmers, servants, labourers, and slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; According to indigenous histories, land was held communally by noble houses or [[clan]]s. Such clans held that the land was the property of the clan ancestors, and such ties between the land and the ancestors were reinforced by the burial of the dead within residential compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie 2000, pp. 470, 473–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===King and court===
[[File:Toniná Stela 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Maya stelae|Stela]] from [[Toniná]], representing the 6th-century king [[Bahlam Yaxuun Tihl]]&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 178. Witschey and Brown 2012, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Classic Maya rule was centred in a royal culture that was displayed in all areas of Classic Maya art. The king was the supreme ruler and held a semi-divine status that made him the mediator between the mortal realm and that of the gods. From very early times, kings were specifically identified with the [[Maya maize god|young maize god]], whose gift of maize was the basis of Mesoamerican civilization. Maya royal succession was [[patrilineality|patrilineal]], and royal power only passed to [[Women rulers in Maya society|queens]] when doing otherwise would result in the extinction of the dynasty. Typically, power was passed to the eldest son. A young prince was called a ''chʼok'' ("youth"), although this word later came to refer to nobility in general. The royal heir was called ''bʼaah chʼok'' ("head youth"). Various points in the young prince's [[Childhood in Maya society|childhood]] were marked by ritual; the most important was a bloodletting ceremony at age five or six years. Although being of the royal bloodline was of utmost importance, the heir also had to be a successful war leader, as demonstrated by taking of captives. The enthronement of a new king was a highly elaborate ceremony, involving a series of separate acts that included enthronement upon a [[jaguars in Mesoamerican cultures|jaguar-skin]] cushion, human sacrifice, and receiving the symbols of royal power, such as a headband bearing a jade representation of the so-called "[[Maya jester god|jester god]]", an elaborate headdress adorned with [[quetzal]] feathers, and a sceptre representing the god [[Kʼawiil]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maya political administration, based around the royal court, was not bureaucratic in nature. Government was hierarchical, and official posts were sponsored by higher-ranking members of the aristocracy; officials tended to be promoted to higher levels of office during the course of their lives. Officials are referred to as being "owned" by their sponsor, and this relationship continued even after the death of the sponsor.&lt;ref name="Foias14p224"&gt;Foias 2014, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maya royal court was a vibrant and dynamic political institution.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2013, pp. 142, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no universal structure for the Maya royal court, instead each polity formed a royal court that was suited to its own individual context.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2013, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of royal and noble titles have been identified by [[epigrapher]]s translating Classic Maya inscriptions. ''[[Ajaw]]'' is usually translated as "lord" or "king". In the Early Classic, an ''ajaw'' was the ruler of a city. Later, with increasing social complexity, the ''ajaw'' was a member of the ruling class and a major city could have more than one, each ruling over different districts.&lt;ref name="D'ArcyHarrison03p114"&gt;D'Arcy Harrison 2003, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Paramount rulers distinguished themselves from the extended nobility by prefixing the word ''kʼuhul'' to their ''ajaw'' title. A ''kʼuhul ajaw'' was "divine lord", originally confined to the kings of the most prestigious and ancient royal lines.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kalomte'' was a royal title, whose exact meaning is not yet deciphered, but it was held only by the most powerful kings of the strongest dynasties. It indicated an overlord, or [[high king]], and the title was only in use during the Classic period.&lt;ref&gt;D'Arcy Harrison 2003, p. 114. Martin and Grube 2000, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; By the Late Classic, the absolute power of the ''kʼuhul ajaw'' had weakened, and the political system had diversified to include a wider aristocracy, that by this time may well have expanded disproportionately.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2013, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maya Presentation of Captives Kimbell.jpg|thumb|Classic period sculpture showing ''sajal'' Aj Chak Maax presenting captives before ruler [[Itzamnaaj Bʼalam III]] of [[Yaxchilan]]&lt;ref&gt;Kimbell Art Museum 2015. Martin and Grube 2000, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A ''sajal'' was ranked below the ''ajaw'', and indicated a subservient lord. A ''sajal'' would be lord of a second- or third-tier site, answering to an ''ajaw'', who may himself have been subservient to a ''kalomte''.&lt;ref name="D'ArcyHarrison03p114"/&gt; A ''sajal'' would often be a war captain or regional governor, and inscriptions often link the ''sajal'' title to warfare; they are often mentioned as the holders of war captives.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2013, pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sajal'' meant "feared one".&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2013, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The titles of ''ah tzʼihb'' and ''ah chʼul hun'' are both related to scribes. The ''ah tzʼihb'' was a royal scribe, usually a member of the royal family; the ''ah chʼul hun'' was the Keeper of the Holy Books, a title that is closely associated with the ''ajaw'' title, indicating that an ''ajaw'' always held the ''ah chʼul hun'' title simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;D'Arcy Harrison 2003, pp. 114–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Other courtly titles, the functions of which are not well understood, were ''yajaw kʼahk''' ("Lord of Fire"), ''tiʼhuun'' and ''ti'sakhuun''. These last two may be variations on the same title,&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2013, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mark Zender has suggested that the holder of this title may have been the spokesman for the ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2013, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Courtly titles are overwhelmingly male-oriented, and in those relatively rare occasions where they are applied to a woman, they appear to be used as honorifics for female royalty.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2013, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Titled elites were often associated with particular structures in the hieroglyphic inscriptions of Classic period cities, indicating that such office holders either owned that structure, or that the structure was an important focus for their activities.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 2013, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''lakam'' was possibly the only non-elite post-holder in the royal court.&lt;ref name="Foias14p224"/&gt; The ''lakam'' was only found in larger sites, and they appear to have been responsible for the taxation of local districts.&lt;ref name="Foias14p224"/&gt;

Different factions may have existed in the royal court. The ''kʼuhul ahaw'' and his household would have formed the central power-base, but other important groups were the priesthood, the warrior aristocracy, and other aristocratic courtiers. Where ruling councils existed, as at Chichen Itza and Copán, these may have formed an additional faction. Rivalry between different factions would have led to dynamic political institutions as compromises and disagreements were played out. In such a setting, public performance was vital. Such performances included [[Maya dance|ritual dances]], presentation of war captives, offerings of tribute, human sacrifice, and religious ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2014, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commoners===
Commoners are estimated to have comprised over 90% of the population, but relatively little is known about them. Their houses were generally constructed from perishable materials, and their remains have left little trace in the archaeological record. Some commoner dwellings were raised on low platforms, and these can be identified, but an unknown quantity of commoner houses were not. Such low-status dwellings can only be detected by extensive [[Remote sensing (archaeology)|remote-sensing]] surveys of apparently empty terrain.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; The range of commoners was broad; it consisted of everyone not of noble birth, and therefore included everyone from the poorest farmers to wealthy craftsmen and commoners appointed to bureaucratic positions.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus 2004a, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Commoners engaged in essential production activities, including that of products destined for use by the elite, such as [[cotton]] and [[cocoa bean|cacao]], as well as subsistence crops for their own use, and utilitarian items such as ceramics and stone tools.&lt;ref&gt;Masson and Peraza Lope 2004, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Commoners took part in warfare, and could advance socially by proving themselves as outstanding warriors.&lt;ref name="Foster02p144"/&gt; Commoners paid taxes to the elite in the form of staple goods such as maize flour and game.&lt;ref name="Foias14p161"&gt;Foias 2014, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that hard-working commoners who displayed exceptional skills and initiative could become influential members of Maya society.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus 2004a, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warfare was prevalent in the Maya world. Military campaigns were launched for a variety of reasons, including the control of trade routes and tribute, raids to take captives, scaling up to the complete destruction of an enemy state. Little is known about Maya military organization, logistics, or training. Warfare is depicted in Maya art from the Classic period, and wars and victories are mentioned in hieroglyphic inscriptions.&lt;ref name="Foster02p143"/&gt; Unfortunately, the inscriptions do not provide information upon the causes of war, or the form it took.&lt;ref name="Aoyama05p291"/&gt; In the 8th–9th centuries, intensive warfare resulted in the collapse of the kingdoms of the Petexbatún region of western Petén.&lt;ref name="Aoyama05p291"&gt;Aoyama 2005, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid abandonment of [[Aguateca]] by its inhabitants has provided a rare opportunity to examine the remains of Maya weaponry ''in situ''.&lt;ref name="Aoyama05p292"&gt;Aoyama 2005, p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; Aguateca was stormed by unknown enemies around 810 AD, who overcame its formidable defences and burned the royal palace. The elite inhabitants of the city either fled or were captured, and never returned to collect their abandoned property. The inhabitants of the periphery abandoned the site soon after. This is an example of intensive warfare carried out by an enemy in order to completely eliminate a Maya state, rather than subjugate it. Research at Aguateca indicated that Classic period warriors were primarily members of the elite.&lt;ref name="Aoyama05p293"&gt;Aoyama 2005, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

From as early as the Preclassic period, the ruler of a Maya polity was expected to be a distinguished war leader, and was depicted with [[Human trophy taking in Mesoamerica|trophy heads]] hanging from his belt. In the Classic period, such trophy heads no longer appeared on the king's belt, but Classic period kings are frequently depicted standing over humiliated war captives.&lt;ref name="Foster02p143"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Right up to the end of the Postclassic period, Maya kings led as war captains. Maya inscriptions from the Classic show that a defeated king could be captured, tortured, and sacrificed.&lt;ref name="Foster02p144"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish recorded that Maya leaders kept track of troop movements in painted books.&lt;ref name="Webster00p66"&gt;Webster 2000, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The outcome of a successful military campaign could vary in its impact on the defeated polity. In some cases, entire cities were sacked, and never resettled, as at Aguateca.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2014, pp. 167–68.&lt;/ref&gt; In other instances, the victors would seize the defeated rulers, their families, and patron gods. The captured nobles and their families could be imprisoned, or sacrificed. At the least severe end of the scale, the defeated polity would be obliged to pay tribute to the victor.&lt;ref name="FOias14p168"&gt;Foias 2014, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warriors===
During the Contact period, it is known that certain military positions were held by members of the aristocracy, and were passed on by patrilineal succession. It is likely that the specialised knowledge inherent in the particular military role was taught to the successor, including strategy, ritual, and war dances.&lt;ref name="Foster02p144"/&gt; Maya armies of the Contact period were highly disciplined, and warriors participated in regular training exercises and drills; every able-bodied adult male was available for military service. Maya states did not maintain standing armies; warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed warleaders. There were also units of full-time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Wise and McBride 2008, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Most warriors were not full-time, however, and were primarily farmers; the needs of their crops usually came before warfare.&lt;ref name="Wise and McBride 2008, p. 34"&gt;Wise and McBride 2008, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 2007, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence from the Classic period that women provided supporting roles in war, but they did not act as military officers with the exception of those rare ruling queens.&lt;ref name="Foster02p145"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; By the Postclassic, the native chronicles suggest that women occasionally fought in battle.&lt;ref name="Foster02p144"/&gt;

===Weapons===
[[File:British Museum Mesoamerica 004.jpg|thumb|Lintel 16 from [[Yaxchilán]], depicting king [[Yaxun Bʼalam IV|Yaxun Bʼalam]] in warrior garb&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, 128, 132.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The ''[[atlatl]]'' (spear-thrower) was introduced to the Maya region by Teotihuacan in the Early Classic.&lt;ref name="Foster02p146"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a {{convert|0.5|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} stick with a notched end to hold a [[dart (missile)|dart]] or [[javelin]].&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, pp. 146–47.&lt;/ref&gt; The stick was used to launch the missile with more force and accuracy than could be accomplished by simply hurling it with the arm alone.&lt;ref name="Foster02p146"/&gt; Evidence in the form of stone blade points recovered from Aguateca indicate that darts and spears were the primary weapons of the Classic Maya warrior.&lt;ref name="Aoyama05p294"&gt;Aoyama 2005, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Commoners used [[blowgun]]s in war, which also served as their hunting weapon.&lt;ref name="Foster02p146"/&gt; The [[bow and arrow]] is another weapon that was used by the ancient Maya for both war and hunting.&lt;ref name="Aoyama05p291"/&gt; Although present in the Maya region during the Classic period, its use as a weapon of war was not favoured;&lt;ref&gt;Aoyama 2005, pp. 294, 301&lt;/ref&gt; it did not become a common weapon until the Postclassic.&lt;ref name="Foster02p146"/&gt; The Contact period Maya also used two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian,&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Rice, Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2009, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the Aztec ''[[macuahuitl]]''. Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish when they conquered the region.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 2007, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins.&lt;ref name="Wise and McBride 2008, p. 34"/&gt;

==Trade==
{{main|Trade in Maya civilization}}
Trade was a key component of Maya society, and in the development of the Maya civilization. The cities that grew to become the most important usually controlled access to vital trade goods, or portage routes. Cities such as Kaminaljuyu and Qʼumarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands, and [[Tazumal|Chalchuapa]] in El Salvador, variously controlled access to the sources of obsidian at different points in Maya history.&lt;ref name="Foster02p319"/&gt; The Maya were major producers of [[cotton]], which was used to make the textiles to be traded throughout Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The most important cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula controlled access to the sources of salt.&lt;ref name="Foster02p319"/&gt; In the Postclassic, the Maya engaged in a flourishing [[Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|slave trade]] with wider Mesoamerica.&lt;ref name="Foias14p18"&gt;Foias 2014, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maya engaged in long distance trade across the Maya region, and across greater Mesoamerica and beyond. As an illustration, an Early Classic Maya merchant quarter has been identified at the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan, in central Mexico.&lt;ref name="Foster02p322"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; Within Mesoamerica beyond the Maya area, trade routes particularly focused on central Mexico and the Gulf coast. In the Early Classic, Chichen Itza was at the hub of an extensive trade network that imported gold discs from [[Colombia]] and [[Panama]], and [[turquoise]] from [[Los Cerrillos, New Mexico]]. Long distance trade of both luxury and utilitarian goods was probably controlled by the royal family. Prestige goods obtained by trade were used both for consumption by the city's ruler, and as luxury gifts to consolidate the loyalty of vassals and allies.&lt;ref name="Foster02p319"/&gt;

Trade routes not only supplied physical goods, they facilitated the movement of people and ideas throughout Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 660.&lt;/ref&gt; Shifts in trade routes occurred with the rise and fall of important cities in the Maya region, and have been identified in every major reorganization of the Maya civilization, such as the rise of Preclassic Maya civilization, the transition to the Classic, and the Terminal Classic collapse.&lt;ref name="Foster02p319"/&gt; Even the Spanish Conquest did not immediately terminate all Maya trading activity;&lt;ref name="Foster02p319"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the Contact period [[Manche Chʼol]] traded the prestige crops of cacao, [[annatto]] and [[vanilla]] into colonial Verapaz.&lt;ref&gt;Caso Barrera and Aliphat Fernández 2006, pp. 31, 36. Caso Barrera and Aliphat Fernández 2007, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merchants===
Little is known of Maya merchants, although they are depicted on Maya ceramics in elaborate noble dress. From this, it is known that at least some traders were members of the elite. During the Contact period, it is known that Maya nobility took part in long distance trading expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of traders were middle class, but were largely engaged in local and regional trade rather than the prestigious long distance trading that was the preserve of the elite.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, pp. 319–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The travelling of merchants into dangerous foreign territory was likened to a passage through the [[Xibalba|underworld]]; the patron deities of merchants were two [[Maya death gods|underworld gods]] carrying backpacks. When merchants travelled, they painted themselves black, like their patron gods, and went heavily armed.&lt;ref name="Foster02p322"/&gt;

The Maya had no pack animals, so all trade goods were carried on the backs of porters when going overland; if the trade route followed a river or the coast, then goods were transported in canoes.&lt;ref name="Foster02p323"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; A substantial Maya trading canoe was encountered off Honduras on [[Christopher Columbus]]'s [[Fourth voyage of Christopher Columbus|fourth voyage]]. It was made from a large hollowed-out tree trunk and had a palm-covered canopy. The canoe was {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} broad and was powered by 25 rowers. Trade goods carried included cacao, obsidian, ceramics, textiles, food and drink for the crew, and copper bells and axes.&lt;ref name="Foster02p324"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; Cacao was used as currency (although not exclusively), and its value was such that counterfeiting occurred by removing the flesh from the pod, and stuffing it with dirt or [[avocado]] rind.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketplaces===
Marketplaces are difficult to identify archaeologically.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlin et al. 2007, p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Spanish reported a thriving [[market economy]] when they arrived in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlin et al. 2007, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt; At some Classic period cities, archaeologists have tentatively identified formal arcade-style masonry architecture and parallel alignments of scattered stones as the permanent foundations of market stalls.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlin et al. 2007, p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study analysed soils from a modern Guatemalan market and compared the results with those obtained from analysis at a proposed ancient market at [[Chunchucmil]]. Unusually high levels of [[zinc]] and [[phosphorus]] at both sites indicated similar food production and vegetable sales activity. The calculated density of market stalls at Chunchucmil strongly suggests that a thriving market economy already existed in the Early Classic.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlin et al. 2007, pp. 363, 369, 380.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists have tentatively identified marketplaces at an increasing number of Maya cities by means of a combination of archaeology and soil analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Foias 2014, p. 14. Sharer and Traxler 2006, 659.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Spanish arrived, Postclassic cities in the highlands had markets in permanent plazas, with officials on hand to settle disputes, enforce rules, and collect taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, 658.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maya art is essentially the art of the royal court. It is almost exclusively concerned with the Maya elite and their world. Maya art was crafted from both perishable and non-perishable materials, and served to link the Maya to their ancestors. Although surviving Maya art represents only a small proportion of the art that the Maya created, it represents a wider variety of subjects than any other art tradition in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Maya art has many regional [[Style (visual arts)|styles]], and is unique in the ancient Americas in bearing narrative text.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The finest surviving Maya art dates to the Late Classic period.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maya exhibited a preference for the colour green or blue-green, and used the same word for the colours blue and green. Correspondingly, they placed high value on apple-green jade, and other [[Greenstone (archaeology)|greenstones]], associating them with the sun-god [[Kinich Ahau|Kʼinich Ajau]]. They sculpted artefacts that included fine [[tessera]]e and beads, to carved heads weighing {{Convert|4.42|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp. 73–75.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maya nobility practised [[Human tooth sharpening|dental modification]], and some lords wore encrusted jade in their teeth. Mosaic funerary masks could also be fashioned from jade, such as that of [[Kʼinich Janaabʼ Pakal]], king of Palenque.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maya stone sculpture emerged into the archaeological record as a fully developed tradition, suggesting that it may have evolved from a tradition of sculpting wood.&lt;ref name="Miller99p78"/&gt; Because of the biodegradability of wood, the corpus of Maya woodwork has almost entirely disappeared. The few wooden artefacts that have survived include three-dimensional sculptures, and hieroglyphic panels.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp. 78–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone [[Maya stelae]] are widespread in city sites, often paired with low, circular stones referred to as altars in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp. 9, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Stone sculpture also took other forms, such as the limestone [[relief]] panels at Palenque and [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; At Yaxchilan, Dos Pilas, Copán, and other sites, stone stairways were decorated with sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp. 80–81. Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; The hieroglyphic stairway at Copán comprises the longest surviving Maya hieroglyphic text, and consists of 2,200 individual glyphs.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest Maya sculptures consisted of architectural façades crafted from stucco. The rough form was laid out on a plain plaster base coating on the wall, and the three-dimensional form was built up using small stones. Finally, this was coated with stucco and moulded into the finished form; human body forms were first modelled in stucco, with their costumes added afterwards. The final stucco sculpture was then brightly painted.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Giant stucco masks were used to adorn temple façades by the Late Preclassic, and such decoration continued into the Classic period.&lt;ref&gt;Estrada-Belli pp. 44, 103–04.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maya had a long tradition of mural painting; rich polychrome murals have been excavated at San Bartolo, dating to between 300 and 200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Saturno, Stuart and Beltrán 2006, 1281–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Walls were coated with plaster, and polychrome designs were painted onto the smooth finish. The majority of such murals have not survived, but Early Classic tombs painted in cream, red, and black have been excavated at Caracol, [[Río Azul]], and Tikal. Among the best preserved murals are a full-size series of Late Classic paintings at [[Bonampak]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flint]], [[chert]], and obsidian all served utilitarian purposes in Maya culture, but many pieces were finely crafted into forms that were never intended to be used as tools.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eccentric flint (archaeology)|Eccentric flints]] are among the finest lithic artefacts produced by the ancient Maya.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p45"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; They were technically very challenging to produce,&lt;ref name="SFU"/&gt; requiring considerable skill on the part of the artisan. Large obsidian eccentrics can measure over {{convert|12|in|cm|order=flip}} in length.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Their actual form varies considerably but they generally depict human, animal and geometric forms associated with [[Maya religion]].&lt;ref name="SFU"&gt;SFU Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.&lt;/ref&gt; Eccentric flints show a great variety of forms, such as crescents, crosses, snakes, and scorpions.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1990, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest and most elaborate examples display multiple human heads, with minor heads sometimes branching off from larger one.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maya textiles are very poorly represented in the archaeological record, although by comparison with other pre-Columbian cultures, such as the Aztecs and the [[Andean civilizations|Andean region]], it is likely that they were high-value items.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, pp. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt; A few scraps of textile have been recovered by archaeologists, but the best evidence for textile art is where they are represented in other media, such as painted murals or ceramics. Such secondary representations show the elite of the Maya court adorned with sumptuous cloths, generally these would have been cotton, but [[North American jaguar|jaguar]] pelts and deer hides are also shown.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceramics are the most commonly surviving type of Maya art. The Maya had no knowledge of the [[potter's wheel]], and Maya vessels were built up by [[Coiling (pottery)|coiling rolled strips]] of clay into the desired form. Maya pottery was not glazed, although it often had a fine finish produced by burnishing. Maya ceramics were painted with clay [[slip (ceramics)|slips]] blended with minerals and coloured clays. Ancient Maya [[Pottery#firing|firing techniques]] have yet to be replicated.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; A quantity of extremely fine ceramic figurines have been excavated from Late Classic tombs on [[Jaina Island]], in northern Yucatán. They stand from {{convert|10|to|25|cm|in}} high and were hand modelled, with exquisite detail.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ik-style ceramics|''Ik''-style]] polychrome ceramic corpus, including finely painted plates and cylindrical vessels, originated in Late Classic Motul de San José. It includes a set of features such as hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour and scenes with dancers wearing masks. One of the most distinctive features is the realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life. The subject matter of the vessels includes courtly life from the Petén region in the 8th century AD, such as diplomatic meetings, feasting, bloodletting, scenes of warriors and the sacrifice of prisoners of war.&lt;ref&gt;Reents-Budet et al. 2007, pp. 1417–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bone, both human and animal, was also sculpted; human bones may have been trophies, or relics of ancestors.&lt;ref name="Miller99p78"&gt;Miller 1999, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maya valued [[Spondylus]] shells, and worked them to remove the white exterior and spines, to reveal the fine orange interior.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the 10th century AD, metallurgy arrived in Mesoamerica from South America, and the Maya began to make small objects in gold, silver and copper. The Maya generally hammered sheet metal into objects such as beads, bells, and discs. In the last centuries before the Spanish Conquest, the Maya began to use the [[Lost-wax casting|lost-wax method]] to [[casting|cast]] small metal pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

One poorly studied area of Maya [[folk art]] is [[Ancient Maya graffiti|graffiti]].&lt;ref&gt;Hutson 2011, p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional graffiti, not part of the planned decoration, was incised into the stucco of interior walls, floors, and benches, in a wide variety of buildings, including temples, residences, and storerooms. Graffiti has been recorded at 51 Maya sites, particularly clustered in the Petén Basin and southern Campeche, and the [[Chenes (Maya architecture)|Chenes]] region of northwestern Yucatán. At Tikal, where a great quantity of graffiti has been recorded, the subject matter includes drawings of temples, people, deities, animals, banners, litters, and thrones. Graffiti was often inscribed haphazardly, with drawings overlapping each other, and display a mix of crude, untrained art, and examples by artists who were familiar with Classic-period artistic conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Hutson 2011, pp. 405–06.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tikal-Reconstruction4.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstruction of the [[Maya city|urban core]] of [[Tikal]] in the 8th century AD]]
The Maya produced a vast array of structures, and have left an extensive architectural legacy. Maya architecture also incorporates various art forms and hieroglyphic texts. Masonry architecture built by the Maya evidences craft specialization in Maya society, centralised organization and the political means to mobilize a large workforce. It is estimated that a large elite residence at Copán required an estimated 10,686 [[man-hour|man-days]] to build, which compares to 67-man-days for a commoner's hut.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 215. Abrams 1994, pp. 60, 130.&lt;/ref&gt; It is further estimated that 65% of the labour required to build the noble residence was used in the quarrying, transporting, and finishing of the stone used in construction, and 24% of the labour was required for the manufacture and application of limestone-based plaster. Altogether, it is estimated that two to three months were required for the construction of the residence for this single noble at Copán, using between 80 and 130 full-time labourers. A Classic-period city like Tikal was spread over {{convert|20|km2|sqmi}}, with an urban core covering {{convert|6|km2|sqmi}}. The labour required to build such a city was immense, running into many millions of man-days.&lt;ref name="Foster02p216"/&gt; The most massive structures ever erected by the Maya were built during the Preclassic period.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, pp. 216–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Craft specialization would have required dedicated stonemasons and plasterers by the Late Preclassic, and would have required planners and architects.&lt;ref name="Foster02p216"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban design===
{{main|Maya city}}
Maya cities were not formally planned, and were subject to irregular expansion, with the haphazard addition of palaces, temples and other buildings.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p34"&gt;Olmedo Vera 1997, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Maya cities tended to grow outwards from the core, and upwards as new structures were superimposed upon preceding architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Maya cities usually had a ceremonial and administrative centre surrounded by a vast irregular sprawl of residential complexes.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p34"/&gt; The centres of all Maya cities featured sacred precincts, sometimes separated from nearby residential areas by walls.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p23"&gt;Schele and Mathews 1999, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; These precincts contained pyramid temples and other monumental architecture dedicated to elite activities, such as basal platforms that supported administrative or elite residential complexes. Sculpted monuments were raised to record the deeds of the ruling dynasty. City centres also featured plazas, sacred ballcourts and buildings used for marketplaces and schools.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p24"&gt;Schele and Mathews 1999, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently causeways linked the centre to outlying areas of the city.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p23"/&gt; Some of these classes of architecture formed lesser groups in the outlying areas of the city, which served as sacred centres for non-royal lineages. The areas adjacent to these sacred compounds included residential complexes housing wealthy lineages. The largest and richest of these elite compounds sometimes possessed sculpture and art of craftsmanship equal to that of royal art.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p24"/&gt;

The ceremonial centre of the Maya city was where the ruling elite lived, and where the administrative functions of the city were performed, together with religious ceremonies. It was also where the inhabitants of the city gathered for public activities.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p34"/&gt; Elite residential complexes occupied the best land around the city centre, while commoners had their residences dispersed further away from the ceremonial centre. Residential units were built on top of stone platforms to raise them above the level of the rain season floodwaters.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p35"&gt;Olmedo Vera 1997, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building materials and methods===
[[File:Comalcalco Museo de Sitio 5.JPG|thumb|right|[[Brick#Fired brick|Fired bricks]] with animal designs from [[Comalcalco]]]]
The Maya built their cities with [[Neolithic]] technology;&lt;ref name="Foster02p238"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; they built their structures from both perishable materials and from stone. The exact type of stone used in masonry construction varied according to locally available resources, and this also affected the building style. Across a broad swathe of the Maya area, limestone was immediately available.&lt;ref name="Hohmann-Vogrin06p195"/&gt; The local limestone is relatively soft when freshly cut, but hardens with exposure. There was great variety in the quality of limestone, with good-quality stone available in the Usumacinta region; in the northern Yucatán, the limestone used in construction was of relatively poor quality.&lt;ref name="Foster02p238"/&gt; Volcanic [[tuff]] was used at Copán, and nearby Quiriguá employed [[sandstone]].&lt;ref name="Hohmann-Vogrin06p195"&gt;Hohmann-Vogrin 2011, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Comalcalco]], where suitable stone was not available locally,&lt;ref name="Foster02p239"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brick#Fired brick|fired bricks]] were employed.&lt;ref name="Hohmann-Vogrin06p195"/&gt; Limestone was burned at high temperatures in order to manufacture cement, plaster, and stucco.&lt;ref name="Foster02p239" /&gt; Lime-based cement was used to seal stonework in place, and stone blocks were fashioned using rope-and-water abrasion, and with obsidian tools. The Maya did not employ a functional wheel, so all loads were transported on litters, barges, or rolled on logs. Heavy loads were lifted with rope, but probably without employing pulleys.&lt;ref name="Foster02p238"/&gt;

Wood was used for beams, and for [[lintel]]s, even in masonry structures.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, pp. 238–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout Maya history, common huts and some temples continued to be built from wooden poles and thatch. [[Adobe]] was also applied; this consisted of mud strengthened with straw and was applied as a coating over the woven-stick walls of huts. Like wood and thatch, adobe was used throughout Maya history, even after the development of masonry structures. In the southern Maya area, adobe was employed in monumental architecture when no suitable stone was locally available.&lt;ref name="Foster02p239"/&gt;

===Principal construction types===
The great cities of the Maya civilization were composed of pyramid temples, palaces, ballcourts, ''[[sacbe]]ob'' (causeways), patios and plazas. Some cities also possessed extensive hydraulic systems or defensive walls. The exteriors of most buildings were painted, either in one or multiple colours, or with imagery. Many buildings were adorned with sculpture or painted stucco reliefs.&lt;ref name="fuente&amp;c99p142"&gt;Fuente, Staines Cicero and Arellano Hernández 1999, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Palaces and acropoleis====
[[File:Sayil1.jpg|thumb|right|Terminal Classic palace complex at [[Sayil]], in northern [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]]&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 546.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
These complexes were usually located in the site core, beside a principal plaza. Maya palaces consisted of a platform supporting a multiroom range structure. The term ''[[acropolis]]'', in a Maya context, refers to a complex of structures built upon platforms of varying height. Palaces and acropoleis were essentially elite residential compounds. They generally extended horizontally as opposed to the towering Maya pyramids, and often had restricted access. Some structures in Maya acropoleis supported [[roof comb]]s. Rooms often had stone benches, used for sleeping, and holes indicate where curtains once hung. Large palaces, such as at Palenque, could be fitted with a water supply, and sweat baths were often found within the complex, or nearby. During the Early Classic, rulers were sometimes buried underneath the acropolis complex.&lt;ref name="Foster02p232"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Some rooms in palaces were true throne rooms; in the royal palace of Palenque there were a number of throne rooms that were used for important events, including the inauguration of new kings.&lt;ref&gt;Christie 2003, pp. 315–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Palaces are usually arranged around one or more courtyards, with their façades facing inwards; some examples are adorned with sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Christie 2003, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; Some palaces possess associated hieroglyphic descriptions that identify them as the royal residences of named rulers. There is abundant evidence that palaces were far more than simple elite residences, and that a range of courtly activities took place in them, including audiences, formal receptions, and important rituals.&lt;ref name="Christie03p315"&gt;Christie 2003, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pyramids and temples====
[[File:Guatemala 074.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tikal Temple I|Temple I]], at [[Tikal]], was a funerary temple in honour of king [[Jasaw Chan Kʼawiil I]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 395, 397.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Temples were sometimes referred to in hieroglyphic texts as ''kʼuh nah'', meaning "god's house". Temples were raised on platforms, most often upon a pyramid. The earliest temples were probably thatched huts built upon low platforms. By the Late Preclassic period, their walls were of stone, and the development of the [[corbel arch]] allowed stone roofs to replace thatch. By the Classic period, temple roofs were being topped with roof combs that extended the height of the temple and served as a foundation for monumental art. The temple shrines contained between one and three rooms, and were dedicated to important deities. Such a deity might be one of the [[Tutelary deity|patron gods]] of the city, or a [[Veneration of the dead|deified ancestor]].&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, freestanding pyramids were shrines honouring powerful ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

====E-Groups and observatories====
The Maya were keen observers of the sun, stars, and planets.&lt;ref name="Foster02p235"/&gt; [[E-Group]]s were a particular arrangement of temples that were relatively common in the Maya region;&lt;ref name="Demarest 2004, p. 201"/&gt; they take their names from Group E at [[Uaxactun]].&lt;ref&gt;Doyle 2012, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; They consisted of three small structures facing a fourth structure, and were used to mark the [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es. The earliest examples date to the Preclassic period.&lt;ref name="Demarest 2004, p. 201"&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mundo Perdido, Tikal|Lost World]] complex at Tikal started out as an E-Group built towards the end of the Middle Preclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Drew 1999, p. 186. Laporte and Fialko 1994, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its nature, the basic layout of an E-Group was constant. A structure was built on the west side of a plaza; it was usually a radial pyramid with stairways facing the cardinal directions. It faced east across the plaza to three small temples on the far side. From the west pyramid, the sun was seen to rise over these temples on the solstices and equinoxes.&lt;ref name="Foster02p235"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; E-Groups were raised across the central and southern Maya area for over a millennium; not all were properly aligned as observatories, and their function may have been symbolic.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, pp. 235–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as E-Groups, the Maya built other structures dedicated to observing the movements of celestial bodies.&lt;ref name="Foster02p235"/&gt; Many Maya buildings were aligned with astronomical bodies, including the planet [[Venus]], and various constellations.&lt;ref name="Demarest 2004, p. 201"/&gt; The [[El Caracol, Chichen Itza|Caracol]] structure at Chichen Itza was a circular multi-level edifice, with a conical superstructure. It has slit windows that marked the movements of Venus. At Copán, a pair of stelae were raised to mark the position of the setting sun at the equinoxes.&lt;ref name="Foster02p235"/&gt;

====Triadic pyramids====
[[File:Triadic pyramid model, Caracol.png|thumb|right|Model of a [[triadic pyramid]] at [[Caracol]], [[Belize]]]]
[[Triadic pyramid]]s first appeared in the Preclassic. They consisted of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward-facing buildings, all mounted upon a single basal platform. The largest known triadic pyramid was built at El Mirador in the Petén Basin; it covers an area six times as large as that covered by Temple IV, the largest pyramid at Tikal.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; The three superstructures all have stairways leading up from the central plaza on top of the basal platform.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; No securely established forerunners of Triadic Groups are known, but they may have developed from the eastern range building of E-Group complexes.&lt;ref name="Hansen 1998, p. 78"&gt;Hansen 1998, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The triadic form was the predominant architectural form in the Petén region during the Late Preclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth 1993, p. 113. Szymanski 2013, pp. 23–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of triadic pyramids are known from as many as 88 archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;Valdés 1994, p. 101. Szymanski 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; At Nakbe, there are at least a dozen examples of triadic complexes and the four largest structures in the city are triadic in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 1991, p. 166. Hansen 1998, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; At El Mirador there are probably as many as 36 triadic structures.&lt;ref&gt;Szymanski 2013, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the triadic form are even known from [[Dzibilchaltun]] in the far north of the Yucatán Peninsula, and Qʼumarkaj in the Highlands of Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 1998, p. 80. Szymanski 2013, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The triadic pyramid remained a popular architectural form for centuries after the first examples were built;&lt;ref name="Hansen 1998, p. 78"/&gt; it continued in use into the Classic Period, with later examples being found at Uaxactun, Caracol, [[Seibal]], [[Nakum]], Tikal and Palenque.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 1998, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The Qʼumarkaj example is the only one that has been dated to the Postclassic Period.&lt;ref&gt;Szymanski 2013, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The triple-temple form of the triadic pyramid appears to be related to [[Maya mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 1991, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ballcourts====

The [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]] is a distinctive pan-Mesoamerican form of architecture. Although the majority of Maya ballcourts date to the Classic period,&lt;ref name="ColasVoß11p186"&gt;Colas and Voß 2011, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest examples appeared around 1000 BC in northwestern Yucatán, during the Middle Preclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Spanish contact, ballcourts were only in use in the Guatemalan Highlands, at cities such as Qʼumarkaj and Iximche.&lt;ref name="ColasVoß11p186"/&gt; Throughout Maya history, ballcourts maintained a characteristic form consisting of an ɪ shape, with a central playing area terminating in two transverse end zones.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; The central playing area usually measures between {{convert|20|and|30|m|ft}} long, and is flanked by two lateral structures that stood up to {{convert|3|or|4|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref&gt;Colas and Voß 2011, p. 189. Taladoire and Colsenet 1991, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The lateral platforms often supported structures that may have held privileged spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Colas and Voß 2011, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza is the largest in Mesoamerica, measuring {{Convert|272|ft|m|order=flip}} long by {{convert|30|m|ft}} wide, with walls standing {{Convert|27|ft|m|order=flip}} high.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional architectural styles===
Although Maya cities shared many common features, there was considerable variation in architectural style.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Such styles were influenced by locally available construction materials, climate, topography, and local preferences. In the Late Classic, these local differences developed into distinctive regional architectural styles.&lt;ref name="Foster02p224"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Central Petén====
The central Petén style of architecture is modelled after the great city of Tikal. The style is characterised by tall pyramids supporting a summit shrine adorned with a roof comb, and accessed by a single doorway. Additional features are the use of stela-altar pairings, and the decoration of architectural façades, lintels, and roof combs with relief sculptures of rulers and gods.&lt;ref name="Foster02p224"/&gt; One of the finest examples of Central Petén style architecture is Tikal Temple I.&lt;ref&gt;Fuente, Staines Cicero and Arellano Hernández 1999, pp. 144–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of sites in the Central Petén style include [[Altun Ha]], Calakmul, [[Holmul]], [[Ixkun]], Nakum, Naranjo, and [[Yaxhá]].&lt;ref name="Fuente&amp;c99p146"&gt;Fuente, Staines Cicero and Arellano Hernández 1999, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Puuc====
The exemplar of Puuc-style architecture is Uxmal. The style developed in the Puuc Hills of northwestern Yucatán; during the Terminal Classic it spread beyond this core region across the northern Yucatán Peninsula.&lt;ref name="Foster02p224"/&gt; Puuc sites replaced rubble cores with lime cement, resulting in stronger walls, and also strengthened their corbel arches;&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, pp. 224–25.&lt;/ref&gt; this allowed Puuc-style cities to build freestanding entrance archways. The upper façades of buildings were decorated with precut stones mosaic-fashion, erected as facing over the core, forming elaborate compositions of long-nosed deities such as the rain god [[Chaac]] and the [[Principal Bird Deity]]. The motifs also included geometric patterns, lattices and spools, possibly influenced by styles from highland [[Oaxaca]], outside the Maya area. In contrast, the lower façades were left undecorated. Roof combs were relatively uncommon at Puuc sites.&lt;ref name="Foster02p225"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chenes====

}}
The Chenes style is very similar to the Puuc style, but predates the use of the mosaic façades of the Puuc region. It featured fully adorned façades on both the upper and lower sections of structures. Some doorways were surrounded by mosaic masks of monsters representing mountain or sky deities, identifying the doorways as entrances to the supernatural realm.&lt;ref name="Foster02p226"/&gt; Some buildings contained interior stairways that accessed different levels.&lt;ref name="Fuente&amp;c99p150"&gt;Fuente, Staines Cicero and Arellano Hernández 1999, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chenes style is most commonly encountered in the southern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula, although individual buildings in the style can be found elsewhere in the peninsula.&lt;ref name="Foster02p226"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of Chenes sites include [[Dzibilnocac]], [[Hochob]], [[Xtampak|Santa Rosa Xtampak]], and [[Tabasqueño]].&lt;ref name="Fuente&amp;c99p150"/&gt;

====Río Bec====
The [[Río Bec]] style forms a sub-region of the Chenes style,&lt;ref name="Foster02p226"/&gt; and also features elements of the Central Petén style, such as prominent roof combs.&lt;ref name="Fuente&amp;c99p149"&gt;Fuente, Staines Cicero and Arellano Hernández 1999, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Its palaces are distinctive for their false-tower decorations, lacking interior rooms, with steep, almost vertical, stairways and false doors.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 226. Fuente, Staines Cicero and Arellano Hernández 1999, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; These towers were adorned with deity masks, and were built to impress the viewer, rather than serve any practical function. Such false towers are only found in the Río Bec region.&lt;ref name="Foster02p226"/&gt; Río Bec sites include [[Chicanná]], [[Hormiguero, Mexico|Hormiguero]], and [[Xpuhil]].&lt;ref name="Fuente&amp;c99p149"/&gt;

====Usumacinta====
The Usumacinta style developed in the hilly terrain of the Usumacinta drainage. Cities took advantage of the hillsides to support their major architecture, as at Palenque and Yaxchilan. Sites modified corbel vaulting to allow thinner walls and multiple access doors to temples. As in Petén, roof combs adorned principal structures. Palaces had multiple entrances that used post-and-lintel entrances rather than [[Corbel arch|corbel vaulting]]. Many sites erected stelae, but Palenque instead developed finely sculpted panelling to decorate its buildings.&lt;ref name="Foster02p224"/&gt;

==Language==
{{main|Mayan languages}}
[[File:Mayan Language Migration Map.svg|thumb|Map of [[Mayan languages|Mayan language]] migration routes]]

Before 2000 BC, the Maya spoke a single language, dubbed [[Proto-Mayan language|proto-Mayan]] by linguists.&lt;ref name="Foster02p274"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistic analysis of reconstructed Proto-Mayan vocabulary suggests that the original Proto-Mayan homeland was in the western or northern Guatemalan Highlands, although the evidence is not conclusive.&lt;ref name="Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 28"/&gt; Proto-Mayan diverged during the Preclassic period to form the major Mayan language groups that make up the family, including [[Huastecan languages|Huastecan]], [[Quichean languages|Greater Kʼicheʼan]], [[Qʼanjobalan languages|Greater Qʼanjobalan]], [[Mamean languages|Mamean]], Tzʼeltalan-Chʼolan, and [[Yucatecan languages|Yucatecan]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p26"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; These groups diverged further during the pre-Columbian era to form over 30 languages that have survived into modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 274. Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The language of almost all Classic Maya texts over the entire Maya area has been identified as [[Classic Maya language|Chʼolan]];&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Late Preclassic text from Kaminaljuyu, in the highlands, also appears to be in, or related to, Chʼolan.&lt;ref&gt;Estrada-Belli 2011, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Chʼolan as the language of Maya text does not necessarily indicate that it was the language commonly used by the local populace – it may have been equivalent to [[Medieval Latin]] as a [[sacred language|ritual]] or [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige language]].&lt;ref&gt;Houston, Robertson and Stuart 2000, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; Classic Chʼolan may have been the prestige language of the Classic Maya elite, used in inter-polity communication such as diplomacy and trade.&lt;ref&gt;Houston, Robertson and Stuart 2000, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; By the Postclassic period, [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec]] was also being written in Maya codices alongside Chʼolan.&lt;ref&gt;Bricker 2007, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and literacy==
[[File:Paris Codex, pages 4-5.jpg|thumb|Pages from the Postclassic period ''[[Paris Codex]]'', one of the few surviving [[Maya codices|Maya books]] in existence]]

The Maya writing system is one of the outstanding achievements of the pre-Columbian inhabitants of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the most sophisticated and highly developed writing system of more than a dozen systems that developed in Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl 2004, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest inscriptions in an identifiably Maya script date back to 300–200 BC, in the Petén Basin.&lt;ref&gt;Saturno, Stuart and Beltrán 2006, p. 1282.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is preceded by several other [[Mesoamerican writing systems]], such as the [[Isthmian script|Epi-Olmec]] and [[Zapotec writing|Zapotec scripts]]. Early Maya script had appeared on the Pacific coast of Guatemala by the late 1st century AD, or early 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;Love 2007, p. 293. Schieber Laverreda and Orrego Corzo 2010, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities between the Isthmian script and Early Maya script of the Pacific coast suggest that the two systems developed in tandem.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p225"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; By about AD 250, the Maya script had become a more formalised and consistent writing system.&lt;ref name="KettunenHelmke08p10"&gt;Kettunen and Helmke 2008, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] and colonial officials, notably [[Diego de Landa|Bishop Diego de Landa]], destroyed Maya texts wherever they found them, and with them the knowledge of Maya writing, but by chance three uncontested [[Maya codices|pre-Columbian books]] dated to the Postclassic period have been preserved. These are known as the ''[[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid Codex]]'', the ''[[Dresden Codex]]'' and the ''[[Paris Codex]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 126. Foster 2002, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; A few pages survive from a fourth, the ''[[Grolier Codex]]'', whose authenticity is disputed. Archaeology conducted at Maya sites often reveals other fragments, rectangular lumps of plaster and paint chips which were codices; these tantalizing remains are, however, too severely damaged for any inscriptions to have survived, most of the organic material having decayed.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p129"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to the few extant Maya writings, [[Michael D. Coe]] stated:

{{Quote|text=[O]ur knowledge of ancient Maya thought must represent only a tiny fraction of the whole picture, for of the thousands of books in which the full extent of their learning and ritual was recorded, only four have survived to modern times (as though all that posterity knew of ourselves were to be based upon three prayer books and 'Pilgrim's Progress').|sign=Michael D. Coe|source=''The Maya'', London: Thames and Hudson, 6th ed., 1999, pp. 199–200.}}

Most surviving pre-Columbian Maya writing dates to the Classic period and is contained in stone inscriptions from Maya sites, such as stelae, or on ceramics vessels. Other media include the aforementioned codices, stucco façades, frescoes, wooden lintels, cave walls, and portable artefacts crafted from a variety of materials, including bone, shell, obsidian, and jade.&lt;ref name="KettunenHelmke08p6"/&gt;

}}
The Maya writing system (often called ''[[Maya hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]]'' from a superficial resemblance to [[Ancient Egypt]]ian writing)&lt;ref&gt;Ellsworth Hamann 2008, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[logosyllabic]] writing system, combining a [[syllabary]] of [[phonetic]] signs representing syllables with [[logogram]] representing entire words.&lt;ref name="KettunenHelmke08p6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka 2008, pp. 30, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the writing systems of the Pre-Columbian New World, Maya script most closely represents the spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;Macri and Looper 2003, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; At any one time, no more than around 500 glyphs were in use, some 200 of which (including variations) were phonetic.&lt;ref name="KettunenHelmke08p6"/&gt;

The Maya script was in use up to the arrival of the Europeans, its use peaking during the Classic Period.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 120, 123.&lt;/ref&gt; In excess of 10,000 individual texts have been recovered, mostly inscribed on stone monuments, lintels, stelae and ceramics.&lt;ref name="KettunenHelmke08p6"&gt;Kettunen and Helmke 2008, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maya also produced texts painted on a form of paper manufactured from processed tree-bark generally now known by its Nahuatl-language name ''[[amatl]]'' used to produce [[codex|codices]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tobin01"&gt;Tobin 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The skill and knowledge of Maya writing persisted among segments of the population right up to the Spanish conquest. The knowledge was subsequently lost, as a result of the impact of the conquest on Maya society.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

The decipherment and recovery of the knowledge of Maya writing has been a long and laborious process.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1994, pp. 245–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Some elements were first deciphered in the late 19th and early 20th century, mostly the parts having to do with [[Maya numerals|numbers]], the Maya calendar, and astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 135–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Major breakthroughs were made from the 1950s to 1970s, and accelerated rapidly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, pp. 271–72.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 20th century, scholars were able to read the majority of Maya texts, and ongoing work continues to further illuminate the content.&lt;ref&gt;Macri and Looper 2003, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kettunen &amp; Helmke 2014, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logosyllabic script===
[[File:Maya script reading direction.png|thumb|right|Reading order of [[Maya script|Maya hieroglyphic text]]]]
The basic unit of Maya logosyllabic text is the glyph block, which transcribes a word or phrase. The block is composed of one or more individual glyphs attached to each other to form the glyph block, with individual glyph blocks generally being separated by a space. Glyph blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern. For ease of reference, epigraphers refer to glyph blocks from left to right alphabetically, and top to bottom numerically. Thus, any glyph block in a piece of text can be identified. C4 would be third block counting from the left, and the fourth block counting downwards. If a monument or artefact has more than one inscription, column labels are not repeated, rather they continue in the alphabetic series; if there are more than 26 columns, the labelling continues as A', B', etc. Numeric row labels restart from 1 for each discrete unit of text.&lt;ref name="Kettunen &amp; Helmke 2014, p. 16"&gt;Kettunen &amp; Helmke 2014, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Mayan text may be laid out in varying manners, generally it is arranged into double columns of glyph blocks. The reading order of text starts at the top left (block A1), continues to the second block in the double-column (B1), then drops down a row and starts again from the left half of the double column (A2), and thus continues in zig-zag fashion. Once the bottom is reached, the inscription continues from the top left of the next double column. Where an inscription ends in a single (unpaired) column, this final column is usually read straight downwards.&lt;ref name="Kettunen &amp; Helmke 2014, p. 16"/&gt;

Individual glyph blocks may be composed of a number of elements. These consist of the main sign, and any affixes. Main signs represent the major element of the block, and may be a [[noun]], [[verb]], [[adverb]], [[adjective]], or [[Phonemic orthography|phonetic sign]]. Some main signs are abstract, some are pictures of the object they represent, and others are "head variants", personifications of the word they represent. Affixes are smaller rectangular elements, usually attached to a main sign, although a block may be composed entirely of affixes. Affixes may represent a wide variety of speech elements, including nouns, verbs, verbal suffixes, prepositions, pronouns, and more. Small sections of a main sign could be used to represent the whole main sign, and Maya scribes were highly inventive in their usage and adaptation of glyph elements.&lt;ref&gt;Kettunen &amp; Helmke 2014, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the archaeological record does not provide examples of brushes or pens, analysis of ink strokes on the Postclassic codices suggests that it was applied with a brush with a tip fashioned from pliable hair.&lt;ref name="Tobin01"/&gt; A Classic period sculpture from Copán, Honduras, depicts a scribe with an inkpot fashioned from a conch shell.&lt;ref name="Webster89p55"&gt;Webster et al. 1989, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations at Aguateca uncovered a number of scribal artefacts from the residences of elite status scribes, including palettes and [[mortar and pestle|mortars and pestles]].&lt;ref name="Aoyama05p293"/&gt;

===Scribes and literacy===
Commoners were illiterate; scribes were drawn from the elite. It is not known if all members of the aristocracy could read and write, although at least some [[Women in Maya society|women]] could, since there are representations of female scribes in Maya art.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt; Maya scribes were called ''aj tzʼib'', meaning "one who writes or paints".&lt;ref name="Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 123"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; There were probably scribal schools where members of the aristocracy were taught to write.&lt;ref&gt;Drew 1999, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; Scribal activity is identifiable in the archaeological record; Jasaw Chan Kʼawiil I, king of Tikal, was interred with his paint pot. Some junior members of the Copán royal dynasty have also been found buried with their writing implements. A palace at Copán has been identified as that of a noble lineage of scribes; it is decorated with sculpture that includes figures holding ink pots.&lt;ref&gt;Drew 1999, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not much is known about Maya scribes, some did sign their work, both on ceramics and on stone sculpture. Usually, only a single scribe signed a ceramic vessel, but multiple sculptors are known to have recorded their names on stone sculpture; eight sculptors signed one stela at Piedras Negras. However, most works remained unsigned by their artists.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

In common with the other Mesoamerican civilizations, the Maya used a base 20 (vigesimal) system.&lt;ref name="Foster 2002, p. 249"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; The bar-and-dot counting system that is the base of Maya numerals was in use in Mesoamerica by 1000 BC;&lt;ref&gt;Blume 2011, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; the Maya adopted it by the Late Preclassic, and added the symbol for zero.&lt;ref&gt;Blume 2011, p. 53. Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been the earliest known occurrence of the idea of an explicit zero worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 101. Justeson 2010, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; although it may have been predated by the [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian system]].&lt;ref&gt;Justeson 2010, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest explicit use of zero occurred on monuments dated to 357 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Justeson 2010, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; In its earliest uses, the zero served as a [[Positional notation|place holder]], indicating an absence of a particular calendrical count. This later developed into a numeral that was used to perform calculation,&lt;ref&gt;Justeson 2010, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and was used in hieroglyphic texts for more than a thousand years, until the writing system was extinguished by the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Justeson 2010, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic number system consists of a dot to represent one, and a bar to represent five.&lt;ref name="Foster02p248"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; By the Postclassic period a shell symbol represented zero; during the Classic period other glyphs were used.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 248. Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maya numerals from 0 to 19 used repetitions of these symbols.&lt;ref name="Foster02p248"/&gt; The value of a numeral was determined by its position; as a numeral shifted upwards, its basic value multiplied by twenty. In this way, the lowest symbol would represent units, the next symbol up would represent multiples of twenty, and the symbol above that would represent multiples of 400, and so on. For example, the number 884 would be written with four dots on the lowest level, four dots on the next level up, and two dots on the next level after that, to give 4×1 + 4×20 + 2×400 = 884. Using this system, the Maya were able to record huge numbers.&lt;ref name="Foster 2002, p. 249"/&gt; Simple addition could be performed by summing the dots and bars in two columns to give the result in a third column.&lt;ref name="Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 101"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calendar==
{{Main|Maya calendar | Mesoamerican Long Count calendar}}
The Maya calendrical system, in common with other Mesoamerican calendars, had its origins in the Preclassic period. However, it was the Maya that developed the calendar to its maximum sophistication, recording lunar and solar cycles, eclipses and movements of planets with great accuracy. In some cases, the Maya calculations were more accurate than equivalent calculations in the [[Old World]]; for example, the Maya solar year was calculated to greater accuracy than the [[Julian calendar|Julian year]]. The Maya calendar was intrinsically tied to Maya ritual, and it was central to Maya religious practices.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; The calendar combined a non-repeating [[Maya Long Count Calendar|Long Count]] with three interlocking cycles, each measuring a progressively larger period. These were the 260-day ''tzolkʼin'',&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; the 365-day ''[[haabʼ]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 52-year [[Calendar Round]], resulting from the combination of the ''tzolkʼin'' with the ''haab'''.&lt;ref name="Foster 2002, p. 253"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also additional calendric cycles, such as an 819-day cycle associated with the four quadrants of Maya cosmology, governed by four different aspects of the god Kʼawiil.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p104"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic unit in the Maya calendar was one day, or ''[[kʼin]]'', and 20 ''kʼin'' grouped to form a ''[[winal]]''. The next unit, instead of being multiplied by 20, as called for by the vigesimal system, was multiplied by 18 in order to provide a rough approximation of the solar year (hence producing 360 days). This 360-day year was called a ''[[Tun (Maya calendar)|tun]]''. Each succeeding level of multiplication followed the vigesimal system.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p102"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 260-day ''tzolkʼin'' provided the basic cycle of Maya ceremony, and the foundations of Maya prophecy. No astronomical basis for this count has been proved, and it may be that the 260-day count is based on the [[pregnancy|human gestation period]]. This is reinforced by the use of the ''tzolkʼin'' to record dates of birth, and provide corresponding prophecy. The 260-day cycle repeated a series of 20-day-names, with a number from 1 to 13 prefixed to indicated where in the cycle a particular day occurred.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p104"/&gt;

The 365-day ''haab'' was produced by a cycle of eighteen named 20-day ''winal''s, completed by the addition of a 5-day period called the ''wayeb''.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p107"/&gt; The ''wayeb'' was considered to be a dangerous time, when the barriers between the mortal and supernatural realms were broken, allowing malignant deities to cross over and interfere in human concerns.&lt;ref name="Foster 2002, p. 253"/&gt; In a similar way to the ''tzʼolkin'', the named ''winal'' would be prefixed by a number (from 0 to 19), in the case of the shorter ''wayeb'' period, the prefix numbers ran 0 to 4. Since each day in the ''tzʼolkin'' had a name and number (e.g. 8 Ajaw), this would interlock with the ''haab'', producing an additional number and name, to give any day a more complete designation, for example 8 Ajaw 13 Keh. Such a day name could only recur once every 52 years, and this period is referred to by [[Mayanist]]s as the Calendar Round. In most Mesoamerican cultures, the Calendar Round was the largest unit for measuring time.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p107"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with any non-repeating calendar, the Maya measured time from a fixed start point. The Maya set the beginning of their calendar as the end of a previous cycle of ''bakʼtun''s, equivalent to a day in 3114 BC. This was believed by the Maya to be the day of the creation of the world in its current form. The Maya used the Long Count Calendar to fix any given day of the Calendar Round within their current great ''Piktun'' cycle consisting of either 20 ''bakʼtun''s. There was some variation in the calendar, specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the ''piktun'' cycle that ended in 3114 BC had only 13 ''bakʼtun''s, but others used a cycle of 13 + 20 ''bakʼtun'' in the current ''piktun''.&lt;ref&gt;Carter 2014 "A single passage on a Late Classic hieroglyphic panel at Palenque makes two further points clear; first, that the count of bakʼtuns will accumulate to 19, as before the present era, before the number in the piktuns place will change; and second, that that number will change to 1, not to 14, just as the bakʼtuns did in 2720 BC. In other words, all piktuns except the present one contained 20 bakʼtuns, but the current one contains 33; all previous kalabtuns, the next place up, contained 20 piktuns, but the current kalabtun contains 33 of those. Presumably the same pattern obtains for the rest of the higher places. This staggered resetting of the higher-order cycles, so jarringly unexpected from a contemporary, Western perspective, suggests an attitude towards time more numerological than mathematical. 13 and 20, after all, are the key numbers of the tzolkʼin, so it is fitting that they should be incorporated into the Long Count at enormous temporal scales."&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there may have been some regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed.&lt;ref&gt;Van Stone 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A full long count date consisted of an introductory glyph followed by five glyphs counting off the number of ''bakʼtun''s, ''katʼun''s, ''tun''s, ''winal''s, and ''kʼin''s since the start of the current creation. This would be followed by the ''tzʼolkin'' portion of the Calendar Round date, and after a number of intervening glyphs, the Long Count date would end with the ''Haab'' portion of the Calendar Round date.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p110"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correlation of the Long Count calendar===
{{main|Mesoamerican Long Count calendar#Correlations between Western calendars and the Long Count}}
Although the [[Maya calendar#Calendar Round|Calendar Round]] is still in use today,&lt;ref&gt;Tedlock 1992, p. 1. Miles 1952, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; the Maya started using an abbreviated [[Maya calendar#Short Count|Short Count]] during the Late Classic period. The Short Count is a count of 13 kʼatuns. The Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel Ralph L. Roys, Washington D.C.; Carnegie Institution 1933, pp. 79, 83&lt;/ref&gt; contains the only colonial reference to classic long-count dates. The most generally accepted correlation is the Goodman-Martínez-Thompson, or GMT, correlation. This equates the Long Count date 11.16.0.0.0 13 Ajaw 8 Xul with the [[Proleptic Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] date of 12 November 1539.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p114"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Epigraphers [[Simon Martin (Mayanist)|Simon Martin]] and [[Nikolai Grube]] argue for a two-day shift from the standard GMT correlation.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spinden Correlation would shift the Long Count dates back by 260 years; it also accords with the documentary evidence, and is better suited to the archaeology of the Yucatán Peninsula, but presents problems with the rest of the Maya region.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p114"/&gt; The George Vaillant Correlation would shift all Maya dates 260 years later, and would greatly shorten the Postclassic period.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p114"/&gt; [[Radiocarbon dating]] of dated wooden lintels at Tikal supports the GMT correlation.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p114"/&gt;

==Astronomy==
{{main|Maya astronomy}}
{{See also|Archaeoastronomy}}
{{Quote|The famous astrologer [[John Dee]] used an Aztec obsidian mirror to see into the future. We may look down our noses at his ideas, but one may be sure that in outlook he was far closer to a Maya priest astronomer than is an astronomer of our century.|[[J. Eric S. Thompson]]|Maya Astronomy: ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'', 1974&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1974, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Madrid Codex astronomer.png|thumb|Representation of an [[Maya astronomy|astronomer]] from the ''[[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid Codex]]''&lt;ref&gt;Milbrath 1999, pp. 252–53.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Maya made meticulous observations of celestial bodies, patiently recording astronomical data on the movements of the sun, moon, Venus, and the stars. This information was used for [[divination]], so Maya astronomy was essentially for [[astrology|astrological]] purposes. Maya astronomy did not serve to study the universe for scientific reasons, nor was it used to measure the seasons in order to calculate crop planting. It was rather used by the priesthood to comprehend past cycles of time, and project them into the future to produce prophecy. The priesthood refined observations and recorded eclipses of the sun and moon, and movements of Venus and the stars; these were measured against dated events in the past, on the assumption that similar events would occur in the future when the same astronomical conditions prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrations in the codices show that priests made astronomical observations using the naked eye, assisted by crossed sticks as a sighting device.&lt;ref name="Foster02p261"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of the few remaining Postclassic codices has revealed that, at the time of European contact, the Maya had recorded eclipse tables, calendars, and astronomical knowledge that was more accurate at that time than comparable knowledge in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maya measured the 584-day Venus cycle with an error of just two hours. Five cycles of Venus equated to eight 365-day ''haab'' calendrical cycles, and this period was recorded in the codices. The Maya also followed the movements of [[Jupiter]], [[Mars]] and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. When Venus rose as the Morning Star, this was associated with the rebirth of the [[Maya Hero Twins]].&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; For the Maya, the [[heliacal rising]] of Venus was associated with destruction and upheaval.&lt;ref name="Foster02p261"/&gt; Venus was closely associated with warfare, and the hieroglyph meaning "war" incorporated the glyph-element symbolizing the planet.&lt;ref name="Foster02p262"&gt;Foster 2002, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Sight-lines through the windows of the Caracol building at Chichen Itza align with the northernmost and southernmost extremes of Venus' path.&lt;ref name="Foster02p261"/&gt; Maya rulers launched military campaigns to coincide with the [[heliacal rising|heliacal]] or cosmical rising of Venus, and would also sacrifice important captives to coincide with such conjunctions.&lt;ref name="Foster02p262"/&gt;

Solar and lunar eclipses were considered to be especially dangerous events that could bring catastrophe upon the world. In the ''Dresden Codex'', a solar eclipse is represented by a serpent devouring the ''kʼin'' ("day") hieroglyph. Eclipses were interpreted as the sun or moon being bitten, and lunar tables were recorded in order that the Maya might be able to predict them, and perform the appropriate ceremonies to ward off disaster.&lt;ref name="Foster02p262"/&gt;

==Religion and mythology==
{{Main|Maya religion|Maya mythology}}
In common with the rest of Mesoamerica, the Maya believed in a supernatural realm inhabited by an array of powerful deities who needed to be placated with ceremonial offerings and ritual practices.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p91"/&gt; At the core of Maya religious practice was the worship of deceased ancestors, who would intercede for their living descendants in dealings with the supernatural realm.&lt;ref name="Demarest04p176"&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest intermediaries between humans and the supernatural were [[shamanism|shamans]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p93"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Maya ritual included the use of [[hallucinogens]] for ''[[Maya priesthood#Offices|chilan]]'', oracular priests. Visions for the ''chilan'' were likely facilitated by consumption of [[Nymphaea|water lilies]], which are hallucinogenic in high doses.&lt;ref&gt;Emboden 1979, pp. 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Maya civilization developed, the ruling elite codified the Maya world view into [[Imperial cult|religious cults]] that justified their right to rule.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p91"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Late Preclassic,&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 721.&lt;/ref&gt; this process culminated in the institution of the divine king, the ''kʼuhul ajaw,'' endowed with ultimate political and religious power.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p93"/&gt;

The Maya viewed the cosmos as highly structured. There were thirteen levels in the heavens and nine in the underworld, with the mortal world in between. Each level had four cardinal directions associated with a different colour; north was white, east was red, south was yellow, and west was black. Major deities had aspects associated with these directions and colours.&lt;ref name="Demarest04p179"/&gt;

Maya households interred their dead underneath the floors, with offerings appropriate to the social status of the family. There the dead could act as protective ancestors. Maya lineages were patrilineal, so the worship of a prominent male ancestor would be emphasised, often with a household shrine. As Maya society developed, and the elite became more powerful, Maya royalty developed their household shrines into the great pyramids that held the tombs of their ancestors.&lt;ref name="Demarest04p176"/&gt;

Belief in supernatural forces pervaded Maya life and influenced every aspect of it, from the simplest day-to-day activities such as food preparation, to trade, politics, and elite activities. Maya deities governed all aspects of the world, both visible and invisible.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p92"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maya priesthood was a closed group, drawing its members from the established elite; by the Early Classic they were recording increasingly complex ritual information in their hieroglyphic books, including astronomical observations, calendrical cycles, history and mythology. The priests performed public ceremonies that incorporated feasting, bloodletting, incense burning, [[Maya music|music]], ritual dance, and, on certain occasions, human sacrifice. During the Classic period, the Maya ruler was the high priest, and the direct conduit between mortals and the gods. It is highly likely that, among commoners, shamanism continued in parallel to state religion. By the Postclassic, religious emphasis had changed; there was an increase in worship of the images of deities, and more frequent recourse to human sacrifice.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p722"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 722.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists painstakingly reconstruct these ritual practices and beliefs using several techniques. One important, though incomplete, resource is physical evidence, such as dedicatory caches and other ritual deposits, shrines, and burials with their associated [[Maya death rituals|funerary offerings]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Maya art, architecture, and writing are another resource, and these can be combined with [[ethnography|ethnographic]] sources, including records of Maya religious practices made by the Spanish during the conquest.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p92" /&gt;

Blood was viewed as a potent source of nourishment for the Maya deities, and the [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrifice]] of a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p751"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 751.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important rituals such as the dedication of major building projects or the enthronement of a new ruler required a human offering. The sacrifice of an enemy king was the most prized, and such a sacrifice involved decapitation of the captive ruler in a ritual reenactment of the decapitation of the Maya maize god by the death gods.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p751"/&gt; In AD 738, the vassal king Kʼakʼ Tiliw Chan Yopaat of Quiriguá captured his overlord, Uaxaclajuun Ubʼaah Kʼawiil of Copán and a few days later ritually decapitated him.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Sacrifice by decapitation is depicted in Classic period Maya art, and sometimes took place after the victim was tortured, being variously beaten, scalped, burnt or disembowelled.&lt;ref name="MillerTaube93p96"&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Another myth associated with decapitation was that of the Hero Twins recounted in the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'': playing a ballgame against the gods of the underworld, the heroes achieved victory, but one of each pair of twins was decapitated by their opponents.&lt;ref name="Gillespie91p322-323"&gt;Gillespie 1991, pp. 322–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p751" /&gt;

During the Postclassic period, the most common form of human sacrifice was heart extraction, influenced by the rites of the Aztecs in the Valley of Mexico;&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p751"/&gt; this usually took place in the courtyard of a temple, or upon the summit of the pyramid.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p752"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 752.&lt;/ref&gt; In one ritual, the corpse would be skinned by assistant priests, except for the hands and feet, and the officiating priest would then dress himself in the skin of the sacrificial victim and perform a ritual dance symbolizing the rebirth of life.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p752"/&gt; Archaeological investigations indicate that heart sacrifice was practised as early as the Classic period.&lt;ref name="TieslerCucina06p493"&gt;Tiesler and Cucina 2006, p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maya world was populated by a great variety of deities, supernatural entities and sacred forces. The Maya had such a broad interpretation of the sacred that identifying distinct deities with specific functions is inaccurate.&lt;ref name="Demarest04p177"&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; The Maya interpretation of deities was closely tied to the calendar, astronomy, and their cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, pp. 177, 179.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of a deity, its characteristics, and its associations varied according to the movement of celestial bodies. The priestly interpretation of astronomical records and books was therefore crucial, since the priest would understand which deity required ritual propitiation, when the correct ceremonies should be performed, and what would be an appropriate offering. Each deity had four manifestations, associated with the cardinal directions, each identified with a different colour. They also had a dual day-night/life-death aspect.&lt;ref name="Demarest04p179"&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Itzamna]] was the creator god, but he also embodied the cosmos, and was simultaneously a [[solar deity|sun god]];&lt;ref name="Demarest04p179"/&gt; Kʼinich Ahau, the day sun, was one of his aspects. Maya kings frequently identified themselves with Kʼinich Ahau. Itzamna also had a night sun aspect, the [[Maya jaguar gods|Night Jaguar]], representing the sun in its journey through the underworld.&lt;ref name="Demarest04p181"&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The four [[Pawatun]]s supported the corners of the mortal realm; in the heavens, the [[Bacab]]s performed the same function. As well as their four main aspects, the Bakabs had dozens of other aspects that are not well understood.&lt;ref name="Demarest04p182"&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The four Chaacs were [[Weather god|storm gods]], controlling thunder, lightning, and the rains.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, pp. 182–83.&lt;/ref&gt; The nine lords of the night each governed one of the underworld realms.&lt;ref name="Demarest04p182"/&gt; Other important deities included the [[Maya moon goddess|moon goddess]], the maize god, and the Hero Twins.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, pp. 181–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Popol Vuh]]'' was written in the Latin script in early colonial times, and was probably transcribed from a hieroglyphic book by an unknown Kʼicheʼ Maya nobleman.&lt;ref name="MillerTaube93p134"&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most outstanding works of indigenous literature in the Americas.&lt;ref name="Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 123"/&gt; The ''Popul Vuh'' recounts the [[Mesoamerican creation myths|mythical creation]] of the world, the legend of the Hero Twins, and the history of the Postclassic Kʼicheʼ kingdom.&lt;ref name="MillerTaube93p134"/&gt; Deities recorded in the ''Popul Vuh'' include [[Hun Hunahpu]], the Kʼicheʼ maize god,&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 729.&lt;/ref&gt; and a triad of deities led by the Kʼicheʼ patron [[Tohil]], and also including the moon goddess [[Awilix]], and the mountain god [[Jacawitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2007, pp. 61n65, 228n646. Miller and Taube 1993, p. 170. Carmack 2001, pp. 275, 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

In common with other Mesoamerican cultures, the Maya worshipped [[Feathered Serpent|feathered serpent deities]]. Such worship was rare during the Classic period,&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; but by the Postclassic the feathered serpent had spread to both the Yucatán Peninsula and the Guatemalan Highlands. In Yucatán, the feathered serpent deity was [[Kukulkan]],&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; among the Kʼicheʼ it was [[Qʼuqʼumatz]].&lt;ref&gt;Christenson 2007, pp. 52–53n20.&lt;/ref&gt; Kukulkan had his origins in the Classic period [[Maya War Serpent|War Serpent]], ''Waxaklahun Ubah Kan'', and has also been identified as the Postclassic version of the [[Vision Serpent]] of Classic Maya art.&lt;ref&gt;Freidel, Schele and Parker 1993, pp. 289, 325, 441n26.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the cult of Kukulkan had its origins in these earlier Maya traditions, the worship of Kukulkan was heavily influenced by the [[Quetzalcoatl]] cult of central Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 582–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Qʼuqʼumatz had a composite origin, combining the attributes of Mexican Quetzalcoatl with aspects of the Classic period Itzamna.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 2008, pp. 60, 121, 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agriculture==
{{Main|Maya cuisine}}
{{See also|Agriculture in Mesoamerica}}
[[File:Día Internacional de los Pueblos Indígenas (7852553230).jpg|thumb|right|[[Maize]] was a [[staple food|staple]] of the [[Maya cuisine|Maya diet]].]]
The ancient Maya had diverse and sophisticated methods of food production. It was believed that [[shifting cultivation]] (swidden) agriculture provided most of their food,&lt;ref&gt;Fisher 2014, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is now thought that permanent [[raised field]]s, [[terrace (agriculture)|terracing]], intensive gardening, forest gardens, and managed fallows were also crucial to supporting the large populations of the Classic period in some areas.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 81–82. Demarest 2004, pp. 130–38. Ross 2011, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, evidence of these different agricultural systems persist today: raised fields connected by canals can be seen on aerial photographs.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Brown and Culbert 1981, p. 1460.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary rainforest species composition has significantly higher abundance of species of economic value to ancient Maya in areas that were densely populated in pre-Columbian times,&lt;ref&gt;Ross 2011, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; and pollen records in lake sediments suggest that maize, [[manioc]], [[sunflower seed]]s, cotton, and other crops have been cultivated in association with deforestation in Mesoamerica since at least 2500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Colunga-García Marín and Zizumbo-Villarreal 2004, pp. S102–S103&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic staples of the Maya diet were maize, beans, and squashes. These were supplemented with a wide variety of other plants either cultivated in gardens or gathered in the forest. At [[Joya de Cerén]], a volcanic eruption preserved a record of foodstuffs stored in Maya homes, among them were chilies and [[tomato]]es. Cotton seeds were in the process of being ground, perhaps to produce cooking oil. In addition to basic foodstuffs, the Maya also cultivated prestige crops such as cotton, cacao and vanilla. Cacao was especially prized by the elite, who consumed [[History of chocolate|chocolate beverages]].&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton was spun, dyed, and woven into valuable textiles in order to be traded.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, pp. 310–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maya had few domestic animals; [[Dogs in Mesoamerica|dogs]] were domesticated by 3000 BC, and the [[Muscovy duck]] by the Late Postclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, pp. 311–312.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ocellated turkey]]s were unsuitable for domestication, but were rounded up in the wild and penned for fattening. All of these were used as food animals; dogs were additionally used for hunting. It is possible that deer were also penned and fattened.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2002, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maya sites==
{{See also|List of Maya sites}}
There are hundreds of Maya sites spread across five countries: Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;
The six sites with particularly outstanding architecture or sculpture are Chichen Itza, Palenque, Uxmal, and Yaxchilan in Mexico, Tikal in Guatemala and Copán in Honduras. Other important, but difficult to reach, sites include Calakmul and El Mirador. The principal sites in the Puuc region, after Uxmal, are [[Kabah (Maya site)|Kabah]], [[Labna]], and Sayil. In the east of the Yucatán Peninsula are Coba and the small site of Tulum.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; The Río Bec sites of the base of the peninsula include [[Becan]], Chicanná, [[Kohunlich]], and Xpuhil. The most noteworthy sites in Chiapas, other than Palenque and Yaxchilan, are Bonampak and Toniná. In the Guatemalan Highlands are Iximche, Kaminaljuyu, [[Mixco Viejo]], and Qʼumarkaj (also known as Utatlán).&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; In the northern Petén lowlands of Guatemala there are many sites, though apart from Tikal access is generally difficult. Some of the Petén sites are Dos Pilas, Seibal, and Uaxactún.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, pp. 245–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Important sites in Belize include Altun Ha, Caracol, and [[Xunantunich]].&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum collections==
{{main|Ancient Maya art#Museum collections}}
[[File:Nationalmuseum für Archäologie und Ethnologie, Guatemala-20.jpg|thumb|right|The Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología, in [[Guatemala City]]]]
There are a great many museums across the world with Maya artefacts in their collections. The Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies lists over 250 museums in its Maya Museum database,&lt;ref&gt;Ros.&lt;/ref&gt; and the European Association of Mayanists lists just under 50 museums in Europe alone.&lt;ref&gt;WAYEB.&lt;/ref&gt;
