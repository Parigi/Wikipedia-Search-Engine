'''West Hollywood''', commonly referred to as '''WeHo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|iː|h|oʊ}}), is a city in [[Los Angeles County, California]], United States. Incorporated in 1984, it is home to the [[Sunset Strip]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]], its population was 34,399.&lt;ref name=quick/&gt; It is considered one of the most prominent [[gay villages]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2014/mar/06/local/la-me-weho-gay-identity-20140307 |title=West Hollywood's increasing diversity inspires mixed emotions |first=Hailey |last=Branson-Potts |date=March 6, 2014 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2011}}

Most historical writings about West Hollywood begin in the late-18th century with European colonization when the Portuguese explorer [[João Rodrigues Cabrilho]] arrived offshore and claimed the already inhabited region for Spain. Around 5,000 of the indigenous inhabitants from the [[Tongva people|Tongva]] [[Indian tribe]] canoed out to greet Juan Cabrillo. The Tongva tribe was a nation of hunter-gatherers known for their reverence of dance and courage. By 1771, these native people had been severely ravaged by the diseases brought in by the Europeans from across wide oceans. The Spanish mission system changed the tribal name to "Gabrielinos", in reference to the [[Mission San Gabriel Arcángel|Mission de San Gabriel]]. Early in 1770 [[Gaspar de Portola]]'s Mexican [[expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] stopped just south of the Santa Monica Mountains near what would become West Hollywood to draw [[pitch (resin)|pitch]] (''brea'' in Spanish) from [[tar pit]]s to waterproof their belongings and to say Mass.{{Sfn|Gierach|11-12}} The Gabrielinos are believed to have burned the pitch for fuel.{{Sfn|Torrence|12}}

By 1780, what became the "[[Sunset Strip]]" was the major connecting road for El [[Pueblo de Los Angeles]], and all ranches westward to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. This land passed through the hands of various owners during the next one hundred years, and it was called names such as "La Brea" and "Plummer" that are listed in historical records.{{Sfn|Gierach|11-12}}&lt;ref name=plummer&gt;{{cite book|last=Plummer|first=E.R.|title=Señor Plummer|year=1942|publisher=Plummer Committee|location=Los Angeles|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of this area was part of the [[Rancho La Brea]], and eventually it came to be owned by the [[Henry Hancock]] family.{{Sfn|Torrence|12}}

During the final decade years of the nineteenth century, the first large land development in what would later become West Hollywood—the town of "Sherman"—was established by [[Moses Sherman]] and his partners of the [[Los Angeles Pacific Railroad]], an [[interurban]] [[railroad]] line which later became part of the [[Pacific Electric Railway]] system. Sherman became the location of the railroad's main shops, [[railroad yard]]s, and "car barns". Many working-class employees of the railroad settled in this town.{{Sfn|Gierach|63}} It was during this time that the city began to earn its reputation as a loosely regulated, liquor-friendly (during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]) place for eccentric people wary of government interference. Despite several annexation attempts, the town elected not to become part of the [[Los Angeles|City of Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name="kcet.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=Masters|first=Nathan|date=1 December 2011|url=http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/history/la-as-subject/west-hollywood-at-27-how-the-town-of-sherman-became-weho.html|title=West Hollywood at 27: How the Town of Sherman Became WeHo|website=[[KCET]]|accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a controversial decision, in 1925 Sherman adopted "West Hollywood", "...a moniker pioneered earlier in the decade by the West Hollywood Realty Board" as its informal name, though it remained under the governance of [[Los Angeles County]].&lt;ref name="kcet.org"/&gt;

For many years, the area that is now the city of West Hollywood was an unincorporated area in the midst of Los Angeles. Because gambling was illegal in the city of Los Angeles, but still legal in Los Angeles County, the 1920s saw the proliferation of many [[casino]]s, night clubs, etc., along [[Sunset Boulevard]] (which starts near downtown Los Angeles and runs westward). These businesses were immune from the sometimes heavy-handed law-enforcement of the [[L.A. Police Department]].

Some people connected with movie-making were attracted to this less-restricted area of the County, and a number of [[architecture|architecturally]] distinctive apartment buildings and hotels were built. Many interior designers, decorators and "to the trade" furnishing showrooms located in West Hollywood date back to the middle of the century.

Eventually, the area and its extravagant nightclubs fell out of favor. However, the Sunset Strip and its restaurants, saloons, and nightclubs continued to be an attraction for out-of-town tourists. During the late 1960s, the Sunset Strip was transformed again during the [[hippie]] movement which brought a thriving music publishing industry coupled with the "hippie" culture. Some young people from all over the country flocked to West Hollywood.

The most recent migration to West Hollywood came about after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when thousands of Russian Jews immigrated to the city. A majority of the 5,000 to 6,000 Russian Jews settled in two major immigration waves, 1978–79 and 1988–92.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tugend |first=Tom |title=Russians &amp; Gays &amp; Lesbians, Oh My... |work=The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles |date=March 24, 2000 |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/old_stories/article/russians_amp_gays_amp_lesbians_oh_my_20000324/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than New York, West Hollywood's Russian-speaking community is the most concentrated single Russian-speaking region in United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Russian Speaking Community |work=City of West Hollywood |url=http://www.weho.org/index.aspx?page=866 |accessdate=March 8, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829194751/http://www.weho.org/index.aspx?page=866 |archivedate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, residents in West Hollywood organized to maintain rent control. When Los Angeles County began planning to discontinue rent controls, West Hollywood was a densely populated area of renters, many of whom would not be able to afford to keep up with the generally rapid raises in rent in the Los Angeles area. A tight coalition of seniors, [[Jew]]s, gays and renters were greatly assisted by the Coalition for Economic Survival (CES)&lt;ref&gt;[[Coalition for Economic Survival]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Circular reference|date=September 2015}}and they swiftly voted to incorporate as the "City of West Hollywood".  West Hollywood then immediately adopted one of the strongest rent control laws in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;The vacancy-control part of this ordinance has since been rendered null by an act of the state legislature in the early 1990s called Costa-Hawkins that effectively ended "strong" rent control measures in California.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of West Hollywood gave the keys to the city to [[Stormy Daniels]] on "Stormy Daniels Day", May 23, 2018.&lt;ref name="bbcnewsstormeydanielsgivenkey"&gt;{{cite news|title=Stormy Daniels given key to the city of West Hollywood|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44234250|accessdate=May 24, 2018|work=BBC News|date=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==

===Local===
The city government is headed by a five-member city council, including a mayor and a mayor pro tem who serve one-year terms. The positions of mayor and mayor pro tem are largely-ceremonial positions which rotate between the council members, and both positions are largely not re-elected in concurrent terms, although council members serve multiple non-concurrent terms in both offices.

West Hollywood was the first city in the country to have a city council with a majority of gay members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gaytoday.badpuppy.com/garchive/people/032000pe.htm |title=The Folks Who Rule in Wilton Manors |first=Jesse |last=Monteagudo |work=Gay Today |date= |accessdate=May 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jonathan |last=Van Dyke |title=WeHo Remains a Coalition, 30 years After Cityhood |work=Park LaBrea News Beverly Press |url=http://beverlypress.com/2014/11/weho-remains-a-coalition-30-years-after-cityhood/ |date=November 27, 2014 |accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current Mayor is John Duran.  Council member [[John Heilman]] is the city's  longest-serving council member (having served almost continuously since 1984).

On February 19, 2001, West Hollywood became the second city in the United States (after [[Boulder, Colorado]]) to change the term pet "owner" to pet "guardian" in their municipal codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nabrlaw.org/portals/10/PDF%20Files/LSOFNHA2002.pdf |title=NABR Animal Law Section – Ownership v.

With West Hollywood being one of the most prominent gay-friendly cities in the United States, [[Proposition 8]] had a higher rate of rejection than it did in any other city in Los Angeles county: 86% of the city voted against the amendment, which restricted marriage to heterosexual couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gay marriage ban: How cities in Los Angeles County voted |url=http://projects.latimes.com/elections/la-county-prop-8-results-by-city/ |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
[[Traffic congestion]], [[public transport]] and parking are critical issues in the city due to its location between access to areas such as [[Greater Hollywood, Los Angeles|Greater Hollywood]] and the [[San Fernando Valley]] to the east and the area of the Los Angeles West Side, with the [[Hollywood Hills]] creating a natural impediment to the north. [[Santa Monica Boulevard]] and [[Sunset Boulevard]] are critical east-west arteries in the metropolitan area, and [[Laurel Canyon Boulevard]] is a popular shortcut through the hills. Nearly 600 employees and 260 buses in the District 7 [[fleet of the LACMTA]] are based in a large facility on prime real estate near [[San Vicente Boulevard]] and [[Santa Monica Boulevard]]. The [[Crenshaw/LAX Line]] extension to the [[Hollywood/Highland station]] is likely to pass through, or along, the edge of West Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hymon |first1=Steve |title=Feasibility study looks at possible routes for Crenshaw North Extension |url=https://thesource.metro.net/2018/07/22/feasibility-study-looks-at-possible-routes-for-crenshaw-north-extension/ |website=The Source |publisher=Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority |access-date=11 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social services===
West Hollywood, with a gay male population of about 39%,&lt;ref name=Dem/&gt; has been disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic which has ravaged its gay male population since the early 1980s. The city funds or subsidizes an array of services for those living with [[HIV]] or [[AIDS]]. The [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation]] parks a Mobile HIV/STD testing van outside of the city's busiest nightclubs on Friday and Saturday nights, and again on Sunday afternoons.  This outreach attempts to intervene with those young people most at-risk for HIV infection. [[Project Angel Food]] receives city funding to deliver hundreds of fresh lunches and dinners daily which are prepared under the supervision of a registered dietitian who tailors the meals to meet individual client's nutritional needs. [[AIDS Project Los Angeles]] (APLA) is a national leader for AIDS policy and advocacy issues and provides assistance to clients navigating the maze of available public benefits.  APLA also provides free dental, psychotherapy and pharmaceutical services. Aid for AIDS provides direct financial support by assisting clients with rent, utility and pharmacy expenses.  The city also subsidizes agencies that help clients train for a return to the workforce. The city permits all residents living with HIV/AIDS to have up to two pets in his or her home regardless of a landlord's specifications in the property's lease.

West Hollywood subsidizes programs for its growing population of children through a partnership with the [[USDA]] and local schools.  "Healthy Start West Hollywood" is a program of the city's Social Services division that introduces pre-Kindergarten through High School age kids to the benefits of good nutrition through such activities as collective vegetable gardens and yoga.

The special needs of senior citizens are addressed through a variety of programs.  West Hollywood either funds or subsidizes agencies that offer adult day care, a roommate matching service, and nutritious meals.  The West Hollywood Senior Center provides recreational programs, excursions, and socializing as well as counseling and case management.

West Hollywood also seeks to address the health needs of residents who do not have adequate insurance by subsidizing the LA Free Clinic and The [[Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center]].  Residents can access free medical, dental, legal and mental health services between these two sites.

The West Hollywood's Public Safety Division publishes guides on sexual assault prevention, nightclub safety, and how to access rape services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weho.org/index.aspx?page=339 |title=Public Safety Education Campaign |work=City of West Hollywood |access-date=March 4, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119050653/http://www.weho.org/index.aspx?page=339 |archivedate=January 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable people==
The issue of [[Paparazzi]] chasing celebrities is raised regularly and the city participates in meetings with other nearby municipalities such as [[Beverly Hills]] and Los Angeles to discuss the problem and possible actions to better control the activity. The epicenter of the [[Thirty Mile Zone]] lies just blocks to the south of the city, and is the basis for the name of [[TMZ on TV]], a paparazzi footage-based program.

==Controversies==

===Discrimination issues===
Sometime in the 1940s, a sign appeared over the bar at [[Barney's Beanery]] that said "FAGOTS {{sic}} – STAY OUT." The message so offended locals that ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine did an article on opposition to the sign in 1964, which included a photograph of the owner steadfastly holding on to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmu.edu/safezone/wm_library/Timeline%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |title=LGBT Timeline (from the 60's to the 90's) from James Sears' LGBT Timeline |work=[[James Madison University]] |access-date=September 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owner died in 1968, and efforts continued to have the sign removed. The [[Gay Liberation Front]] organized a [[Zap (action)|zap]] of the restaurant on February 7, 1970, to push for its removal. The sign disappeared that day.&lt;ref&gt;Teal, pp. 255–57&lt;/ref&gt; The sign was put up and taken down several times over the next 14 years, but the practice ended in December 1984, days after the city voted itself into existence. The then-mayor, [[Valerie Terrigno]], the entire city council and gay-rights activists marched into Barney's and relieved the wall of the offending sign.&lt;ref&gt;Kenney, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; It was held by [[Morris Kight]] for many years and now rests in the [[ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}
