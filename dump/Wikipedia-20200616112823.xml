'''Sir Jonathan Paul''' "'''Jony'''" '''Ive''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KBE|HonFREng|RDI|sep=,|size=small}} (born 27 February 1967) is a British [[industrial design|industrial]], [[product design|product]] and [[Architectural designer|architectural]] designer and former [[Chief Design Officer]] (CDO) of [[Apple Inc.]], now the serving [[Chancellor#Educational_usage|Chancellor]] of the [[Royal College of Art]] in London. He joined Apple in September 1992, where he remained until his departure in November 2019. Following several years of designing Apple products, he was promoted to Senior Vice President of Industrial Design in the late 1990s after the return of co-founder [[Steve Jobs]] to the company, and CDO in 2015. Working closely with Jobs during their tenure together at Apple, Ive played a vital role in the designs of the [[iMac]], [[Power Mac G4 Cube]], [[iPod]], [[iPhone]], [[iPad]], [[MacBook]], and parts of the user interface of Apple's mobile [[operating system]] [[iOS]], among other products. He also helped design Apple's major architectural projects, such as [[Apple Park]] and [[Apple Stores]].&lt;!-- The lack of citations is purposeful.

Born in [[London]], England, Ive lived there until his family moved to [[Stafford]] when he was 12. He studied design at [[Northumbria University]],{{Efn|When Ive attended the university in the late-1980s, it was called "Newcastle Polytechnic"}} and was later hired by the London-based start-up design firm Tangerine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tangerine.net/jony-ive-apple-designer-started-career-tangerine-set-studio/|title=Jony Ive, Apple designer who started career at tangerine, sets up studio|date=2019-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720171112/https://tangerine.net/jony-ive-apple-designer-started-career-tangerine-set-studio/|access-date=2019-07-20|archive-date=20 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began working at Apple in the early 1990s, designing the decade's [[PowerBook]]s and [[Macintosh|Macs]], finally taking up US citizenship in 2012 to become a dual British-American national. He was invited to join the Royal College of Art in May 2017 as its head-of-college, serving a fixed five-year term until May 2022.

Ive has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Jony Ive|a number of accolades and honours]] for his designs and patents. In the United Kingdom, he has been appointed a [[Royal Designers for Industry|Royal Designer for Industry]] (RDI), an [[Royal Academy of Engineering|Honorary Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering]] (HonFREng), and a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE). In 2018, he was awarded the Professor Hawking Fellowship. In a 2004 [[BBC]] poll of cultural writers, Ive was ranked the most influential person in [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]]. His designs have been described as integral to the successes of Apple, which has gone on to become the world's largest information technology company by revenue and the largest company in the world by market capitalization.

On 27 June 2019, in an exclusive interview with the ''[[Financial Times]]'', Ive announced he would leave Apple after 27 years to start his own design firm, ''LoveFrom,'' together with industrial designer [[Marc Newson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48795057.stm|title=iPhone designer Ive to leave Apple|date=27 June 2019|accessdate=27 June 2019|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/947e557a-98a8-11e9-8cfb-30c211dcd229|title=Jony Ive, iPhone designer, announces Apple departure {{!}} Financial Times|date=2019-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720172338/https://www.ft.com/content/947e557a-98a8-11e9-8cfb-30c211dcd229|access-date=2019-07-20|archive-date=20 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/jony-ive-is-departing-apple-but-he-started-leaving-years-ago-11561943376|title=Jony Ive Is Leaving Apple, but His Departure Started Long Ago|first=Tripp|last=Mickle|website=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/story/jony-ive-leaves-apple/|title=Jony Ive Is Leaving Apple|journal=Wired|via=www.wired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761736/jony-ive-apple-leave-iphone-chief-design-officer-lovefrom-company-quit|title=Jony Ive leaving Apple after nearly 30 years to start new design firm|first=Chris|last=Welch|date=27 June 2019|website=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Jonathan Paul Ive was born on 27 February 1967 in [[Chingford]], London, England.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/apple-design-genius-jonathan-ive|title=A Rare Look at Design Genius Jony Ive: The Man Behind the Apple Watch|last=Sullivan|first=Robert|date=1 October 2014|work=Vogue|access-date=1 November 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/9283486/Jonathan-Ive-interview-Apples-design-genius-is-British-to-the-core.html|title=Jonathan Ive interview: Apple's design genius is British to the core|last=Richmond|first=Shane|date=23 May 2012|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=1 November 2018|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Michael Ive, was a [[silversmith]] who lectured at [[Middlesex Polytechnic]], and his grandfather was an engineer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Raised just outside of London, Ive attended the [[Chingford Foundation School]] and [[Walton High School (Stafford)|Walton High School]] in [[Stafford]] where he studied sculpture and chemistry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While attending secondary school, Ive was diagnosed with dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/the-fabulous-life-of-sir-jony-ive-2014-7|title=The life and rise of Jony Ive, the legendary Apple designer who's now leaving to strike out on his own|last=Aydin|first=Paige Leskin, Rebecca|website=Business Insider|access-date=2019-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to a March 2014 interview with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', "It was his teenage love of cars that made Ive decide to become a designer. When he left school, he checked out a few car-design courses in London, including one at the Royal College. He swiftly changed his mind. 'The classes were full of students making vroom! vroom! noises as they drew,' he recalls, still horrified. So he headed to Newcastle Polytechnic to study industrial design. His work there — notably a telephone and a hearing aid — was so good it was exhibited at the Design Museum in London."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/jonathan-ive-apple-interview/|title=Apple Designer Jonathan Ive Talks About Steve Jobs and New Products|date=2019-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720173949/https://time.com/jonathan-ive-apple-interview/|access-date=2019-07-20|archive-date=20 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ive attended [[Newcastle Polytechnic]] (later renamed [[Northumbria University|University of Northumbria at Newcastle]]) during the late-1980s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While at Newcastle, some of his more notable designs—including a [[hearing aid]] design—were exhibited at the [[Design Museum]] in London.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ive graduated with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|first class]] [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in industrial design in 1989.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Ive's designs at polytechnic garnered Ive the RSA Student Design Award, which afforded him a small [[stipend]] and a travel expense account to use on a trip to the United States.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=640f7JNTX0kC&amp;pg=PA343&amp;lpg=PA343&amp;dq=jony+ive+shaved+head#v=onepage|title=The Apple Revolution: Steve Jobs, the Counterculture and How the Crazy Ones Took over the World|last=Dormehl|first=Luke|date=8 August 2012|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781448131365|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ive traveled to [[Palo Alto, California]], where he met with various design experts including [[Robert Brunner]]—a designer who ran a small consultancy firm that would later join [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computers]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After returning to England six weeks later, Ive [[Internship|interned]] at product design agency Roberts Weaver Group (his college sponsor) where he impressed executives with a pronounced attention to detail and work ethic.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Career==

=== Tangerine ===
After a year with Roberts Weaver, Ive joined the industrials group at a London startup design agency called Tangerine, located in [[Hoxton Square]] where he designed a diverse array of products, such as microwave ovens, toilets, drills and toothbrushes.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/jonathan-ive-apple-interview/|title=Jonathan Ive Designs Tomorrow|author=John Arlidge|date=17 March 2014|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=Time Inc|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his frustration with the position reached a turning point after he designed a toilet, bidet, and sink for client [[Ideal Standard]], and the company's boss rejected Ive's work, stating that the products were too costly and looked too modern.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seth"&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Things You Didn't Know About mApple Design Chief Jony Ive|url=http://mashable.com/2013/11/06/jony-ive-biography/|work=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=7 November 2013|author=Seth Fiegerman|date=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ive was unhappy working for clients whom he disliked and who had different ideas.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; From 1990 to 1992, [[Robert Brunner]], as he was ascending the corporate ladder, unsuccessfully attempted to recruit Ive to Apple.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; During this time, Apple became a client of Tangerine, with Ive spearheading the firm's initial [[PowerBook]] designs.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

=== Apple ===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

He was formally recruited to Apple as a full-time employee in September 1992.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ive was initially apprehensive about leaving Tangerine for Apple as he thought the move from Britain to California would take a toll on his family.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; His first major assignment in Apple's industrial design group regarded the second generation of the [[Newton (platform)|Newton]] and the [[MessagePad]] 110.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; Initial design failures and lack of commercial success during the early 1990s, prompted Ive to nearly quit on multiple occasions.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; [[Steve Jobs]], who had been ousted by other Apple executives in 1985, was staging a return to the company and recruited Ive to join him in taking the firm in a different direction.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; [[Jon Rubinstein]], Ive's boss at the time, managed to retain Ive as an employee by explaining that Apple was "going to make history" following the revival of the company in 1996.&lt;ref name="Seth" /&gt; 

[[File:IMac Bondi Blue.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Original 1998 [[iMac G3]]]]
He became the senior vice president of industrial design in 1997 after the return of Jobs, and subsequently headed the industrial design team responsible for most of the company's significant hardware products.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ive's first design assignment in this capacity was the [[iMac]], introduced in 1998 (he is credited with designing its translucent plastic case). The iMac helped pave the way for many other designs such as the [[iPod]] and eventually the [[iPhone]] and the [[iPad]].&lt;ref name="fastcompany"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Ohannessian|first=Kevin|title=100 Most Creative People in Business: No. 1 – Jonathan Ive|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/100/2009/jonathan-ive|magazine=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|accessdate=2 January 2012|date=18 May 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227064856/http://www.fastcompany.com/100/2009/jonathan-ive|archivedate=27 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ive explained the close rapport that existed in his working relationship with Jobs in 2014: "When we were looking at objects, what our eyes physically saw and what we came to perceive were exactly the same. And we would ask the same questions, have the same curiosity about things."&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

Ive was given his own design office at Apple during the early 2000s in which he oversees the work of his appointed design team, and he is the only Apple designer with a private office. Only his core team—which consists of around 15 people from the UK, the US, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand (who have worked together for around two decades)—and top Apple executives are allowed into the office, as it contains all of the concepts, including prototypes, that the design team is working on.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; Ive also refuses to allow his children or family members to enter the office.&lt;ref name="Seth" /&gt; During the early 2010s, Jobs declared that Ive "has more operational power than anyone else at Apple except me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/8985289/Apple-designer-becomes-Sir-Jonathan-Ive-in-New-Year-Honours.html|title=Apple designer becomes Sir Jonathan Ive in New Year Honours|last=Richmond|first=Shane|date=31 December 2011|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=15 June 2012|location=London|quote=According to Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs, the company's late chief executive gave Ive a unique position within the company. Jobs told Isaacson: "He's not just a designer. That's why he works directly for me. He has more operational power than anyone else at Apple except me. There's no one who can tell him what to do, or to butt out. That's the way I set it up."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offices of Jobs and Ive in [[Apple Campus|Apple's Cupertino headquarters]] were linked through a hidden, built-in corridor with single-access doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/17/apples-jony-ive-digested-23-things-weve-learned|title=Apple's Jony Ive digested: 23 things we've learned|last=Gibbs|first=Samuel|date=17 March 2015|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 it was reported that Ive was paid $30&amp;nbsp;million in [[Salary|base salary]] with a $25&amp;nbsp;million [[Option (finance)|stock bonus]] in total compensation for the year.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/01/07/apple-jony-ive-compensation/|title=How Much Does Apple Pay Jony Ive?|last=Phillip|first=Elmer-Dewitt|date=6 January 2017|work=Fortune|access-date=1 November 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His compensation ceased to be publicly disclosed by the firm thereafter, rendering him the only Apple executive to be afforded such as provision.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A year later it was estimated that his [[net worth]] was [[Pound sign|£]]80&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Influences ==
The work and principles of [[Dieter Rams]], the chief designer at [[Braun (company)|Braun]] from 1961 until 1995, influenced Ive's work. In [[Gary Hustwit]]'s documentary film ''[[Objectified]]'' (2009), Rams says that Apple is one of only a handful of companies existing today that design products according to [[Dieter Rams#"Good design" principles|his ten principles of good design]].&lt;ref name="braun_desevo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.braun.com/global/world-of-braun/braun-design/design-evolution.html|title=Design evolution|year=2009|publisher=Braun GmbH|accessdate=24 May 2011|quote=Designer: Dieter Rams and Dietrich Lubs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/343641/1960s-braun-products-hold-the-secrets-to-apples-future|title=The Future of Apple Is in 1960s Braun: 1960s ''Braun Products Hold the Secrets to Apple's Future''|date=14 January 2008|publisher=gizmodo.com (Gawker Media)|accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also said to have been influenced by the [[Bauhaus]] tradition (known for its credos [[form follows function]] and [[less is more (architecture)|less is more]]), which emerged in Germany during the 1920s and became a staple design approach adopted by the [[Ulm School of Design]] during the 1950s. The Bauhaus / Ulm design style was also adopted during the 1980s by luxury automotive brand [[Audi]], which also influenced Jonathan Ive's designs (particularly his work with Apple), and has garnered comparisons in [[Stencil|color stencil]], structure, and [[Lighting designer|lighting design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2013/11/30/jony-ives-no-longer-so-secret-design-weapon/#da920fd3f62c|title=Jony Ive's No Longer So Secret Design Weapon|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/343641/1960s-braun-products-hold-the-secrets-to-apples-future|title=Braun Products Hold The Secrets To Apple's Future|work=Gizmodo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
While he was attending secondary school at [[Walton High School (Stafford)|Walton High School]] in [[Stafford]] he met his future wife, British writer and historian Heather Pegg Ive in 1987.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He and Pegg have two sons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His family resides in the [[Pacific Heights, San Francisco|Pacific Heights]] neighbourhood of San Francisco, California.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their home retailed for [[United States dollar|US$]]17.0&amp;nbsp;million in 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ive commutes an hour and a half from San Francisco to [[Apple Park|Apple's headquarters]] in [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]] every day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to the ''[[Sunday Times Rich List]]'' in 2019, Ive is worth £192 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sunday-times-rich-list-2019-profiles-602-650-sting-rod-stewart-7v729g2dj|title=Rich List 2019: profiles 602-650, featuring Sting and Sir Rod Stewart|last=Times|first=The Sunday|date=2019-05-12|access-date=2019-11-20|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known to live a reserved, private home life, he shuns publicity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He explained in 2014 that if his work at Apple ever became substandard, he would "make things for [himself], for [his] friends at home instead".&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;
