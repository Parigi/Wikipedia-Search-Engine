Many countries and territories have installed significant [[solar power]] capacity into their electrical grids to supplement or provide an alternative to [[conventional energy]] sources. 
Solar power plants use one of two technologies:
* [[Photovoltaic]] (PV) [[Photovoltaic systems|systems]] use [[solar panel]]s, either on [[Rooftop photovoltaic power station|rooftops]] or in ground-mounted [[solar farm]]s, converting sunlight directly into electric power.
* [[Concentrated solar power]] (CSP, also known as "concentrated solar thermal") plants use [[solar thermal energy]] to make steam, that is thereafter converted into electricity by a turbine.

Worldwide [[growth of photovoltaics]] is extremely dynamic and varies strongly by country. 
As of 2020, there are at least 37 countries around the world with a cumulative PV capacity of more than one gigawatt.
By the end of 2016, cumulative photovoltaic capacity increased by more than 75 [[gigawatt]] (GW) and reached at least 303&amp;nbsp;GW, sufficient to supply approximately 1.8 percent of the world's total [[electricity consumption]]. 
The top installers of 2016 were [[#China|China]], the [[#United States|United States]], and [[#India|India]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/iea-global-installed-pv-capacity-leaps-to-303-gw IEA: Global Installed PV Capacity Leaps to 303 Gigawatts], greentechmedia, Eric Wesoff, April 27, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 
The available solar PV capacity in Honduras is now sufficient to supply 12.5% of the nation's electrical power while [[#Italy|Italy]], Germany and [[#Greece|Greece]] can produce between 7% and 8% of their respective domestic electricity consumption.&lt;ref name="IEA-PVPS-2016"&gt;[http://www.iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/statistics/IEA-PVPS_-_A_Snapshot_of_Global_PV_-_1992-2016__1_.pdf 2016 Snapshot of Global Photovoltaic Markets], International Energy Agency, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=epia-2015&gt;{{cite web |title = Global Market Outlook for Solar Power 2015-2019 |url = http://www.solarpowereurope.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/Publications/Global_Market_Outlook_2015_-2019_lr_v23.pdf |website = www.solarpowereurope.org |publisher = Solar Power Europe (SPE), formerly known as EPIA – European Photovoltaic Industry Association |accessdate = 9 June 2015 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6ZA1o2aLo?url=http://www.solarpowereurope.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/Publications/Global_Market_Outlook_2015_-2019_lr_v23.pdf |archivedate = 9 June 2015 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iea-pvps-snapshot-1992-2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/technical/PVPS_report_-_A_Snapshot_of_Global_PV_-_1992-2014.pdf|title=Snapshot of Global PV 1992-2014|date=30 March 2015|website=iea-pvps.org|publisher=International Energy Agency — Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XPpb1fai?url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/index.php?id=92&amp;eID=dam_frontend_push&amp;docID=2430|archivedate=30 March 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an almost two decade long hiatus, [[Concentrated solar power#Deployment around the world|deployment of CSP]] resumed in 2007. 
However, the design for several new projects is being changed to cheaper photovoltaics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cleantechnica.com/2014/02/27/csp-fallen-wayside-may-come-back-big-2020/ |title=CSP Has Fallen By The Wayside – But May Come Back Big By 2020 |website=[[CleanTechnica]] |date=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Most [[List of solar thermal power stations|operational CSP stations]] are located in [[#Spain|Spain]] and the United States, while [[List of photovoltaic power stations|large solar farms]] using photovoltaics are being constructed in an expanding list of geographic regions.
As of January 2017, the largest solar power plants in the world are the 850&amp;nbsp;MW [[Longyangxia Dam Solar Park]] in China for PV and the 377&amp;nbsp;MW [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]] in the United States for CSP.

== Africa ==
{{Main|Solar power in Africa}}

Many African countries receive on average a very high number of days per year of bright sunlight, especially the dry areas, which include the deserts (such as the [[Sahara]]) and the steppes (such as the [[Sahel]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://userwww.sfsu.edu/~ciotola/solar/asn_94nuclear.html Solar Power in Africa], National Solar Power Research Institute, Yansane A. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This gives solar power the potential to bring energy to virtually any location in Africa without the need for expensive large scale grid level infrastructural developments.
The distribution of solar resources across Africa is fairly uniform, with more than 85% of the continent's landscape receiving at least 2,000 kWh/(m² year). A study indicates that a solar generating facility covering just 0.3% of the area comprising North Africa could supply all of the energy required by the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trecers.net/downloads/med-csp_en.pdf Report on Solar Power Potential] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927023047/http://www.trecers.net/downloads/med-csp_en.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}, German Aerospace Center&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Algeria ===
{{main|Solar power in Algeria}}
Algeria has the highest technical and economical potential for solar power exploitation in the MENA region, with about 170 TWh per year. First industrial scale solar thermal power project has been initiated by inauguration of Hassi R'Mel power station in 2011. This new hybrid power plant combines a 25-megawatt (MW) concentrating solar power array in conjunction with a 130 MW combined cycle gas turbine plant.
In addition, Algeria has launched in 2011 a national program to develop renewable energy based on photovoltaics (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP) and wind power, and to promote energy efficiency. The program consists of installing up to 12 GW of power generating capacity from renewable sources to meet the domestic electricity demand by 2030.

=== Morocco ===
{{main|Solar power in Morocco}}
Solar power in Morocco is enabled by the country having one of the highest rates of solar [[insolation]] among other countries— about 3,000 hours per year of sunshine but up to 3,600 hours in the desert. [[Morocco]] has launched one of the world's largest solar energy projects costing an estimated $9&amp;nbsp;billion. The aim of the project is to create 2,000 megawatts of solar generation capacity by the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-16983-afdb-helps-fund-144bn-moroccan-solar-project/ AfDB helps fund $1.44bn Moroccan solar project]&lt;/ref&gt; Five solar power stations are to be constructed, including both [[photovoltaic]] and [[concentrated solar power]] technology. The Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy (MASEN), a public-private venture, has been established to lead the project. The first plant will be commissioned in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecogeek.org/component/content/article/3770 Morocco Building 500 MW Solar Power Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924062425/http://ecogeek.org/component/content/article/3770 |date=2014-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the entire project in 2020. Once completed, the solar project will provide 38% of Morocco's annual electricity generation.

=== South Africa ===
{{main|Solar power in South Africa}}

South Africa had 1329 MW of PV installations and 100 MW of concentrating solar thermal at the end of 2016. It is expected to reach an installed capacity 8,400 MW by 2030, along with 8,400 MW of [[wind power]].&lt;ref name=reve&gt;[http://www.evwind.es/noticias.php?id_not=17693 Solar energy in South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; The country's insolation greatly exceeds the average values in Europe, Russia, and most of North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.solarstreetscapes.com/gallery79052.cfm?startrow=9 |title=Insolation maps, retrieved April 14, 2012 |access-date=August 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140603131338/http://www.solarstreetscapes.com/gallery79052.cfm?startrow=9 |archive-date=June 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
{{main|Solar power in China}}
[[File:China Photovoltaics Installed Capacity 2016.png|thumb|China's installed solar PV]]
China is leading the world in solar PV generation, with the total installed capacity exceeding 100 GW. China is the world's largest market for both [[photovoltaics]] and [[solar thermal energy]]. and in the last few years, more than half of the total PV additions came from the country. Solar power in the People's Republic of China is one of the biggest industries and the subsidies by the government have helped in bringing down the cost of solar power, not only in China, but the whole world. Three of the top four [[List of photovoltaic power stations|largest photovoltaic power stations]] in operation are located in China, including the world's largest Tengger Desert Solar Park. China also leads the world in [[solar water heating]] with 290 [[GWth]] in operation at the end of 2014, accounting for about 70% of the total world capacity. China's goal is to reach 1,300 GW of Solar Capacity by 2050.

Solar power features prominently in Modi government's US$2.5 billion SAUBHAGYA scheme launched in July 2015 to electrify every Indian household by 2019 — a huge task considering around 300 million people were without electricity. The use of local mini-grids run on solar power is “a big part of the push, with 60 percent of new connections expected to be to renewable power", according to a report by the International Energy Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-solarpower-women/solar-power-push-lights-up-options-for-indias-rural-women-idUSKBN1FW0LI|title=Solar power push lights up options for India's rural women|date=2018-02-12|work=Reuters|accessdate=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government provides subsidy of up to 90% of the upfront capital cost to install solar-powered water pumping systems for irrigation and drinking water.&lt;sup&gt;[32]&lt;/sup&gt; As of 30 November 2017, more than 142,000 solar pumps have been installed to irrigate the agricultural fields.&lt;sup&gt;[33]&lt;/sup&gt; This scheme weans farmers away from diesel-powered pumps and generates extra income for them by allowing to sell surplus power to the grid. It is one of the innovative ways that the government is empowering the rural population with the help of solar energy by addressing specific issues such as water availability. The solar panels are being built over the irrigation canals to preserve water from evaporation in drought-prone sunny areas. The world's first canal-top solar project was set up on Narmada in Gujarat in 2012. For the last mile connectivity in remote and inaccessible areas, the government provides solar power packs of 200 to 300 watt-peak (Wp), along with battery bank, that includes five LED lights, one DC fan and one DC power plug.&lt;sup&gt;[34]&lt;/sup&gt; Other schemes includes Solar Street Light Scheme, providing solar direct current lighting systems, solar lanterns, solar cookers, etc.

In January 2016, the Prime Minister of India, [[Narendra Modi]], and the former President of France, [[François Hollande]], laid the foundation stone for the headquarters of the [[Sunshine countries|International Solar Alliance]] (ISA) in Gwalpahari, India, an alliance of 121 countries, announced at the Paris COP21 climate summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/pm-narendra-modi-and-french-president-francois-hollande-to-launch-game-changing-solar-alliance/articleshow/49975568.cms|title=PM Narendra Modi and French President Francois Hollande to launch game changing solar alliance|last=Goswami|first=Urmi|date=2015-11-30|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/world/international-solar-alliance-sign-of-indias-leadership-on-global-stage-say-experts-2528060.html|title=International Solar Alliance sign of India's leadership on global stage, say experts - Firstpost|website=firstpost.com|access-date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Solar Alliance|ISA]] focuses on promoting and developing solar energy and reducing production and development costs through wider deployment of solar technologies in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.alternet.org/environment/india-unveils-global-solar-alliance-120-countries-paris-climate-summit|title=India Unveils Global Solar Alliance of 120 Countries at Paris Climate Summit|last=Neslen|first=Arthur|date=2015-12-04|newspaper=AlterNet|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/world/paris-climate-meet-indialed-global-solar-alliance-to-counter-developed-nations/article7916353.ece|title=Paris climate meet: India-led global solar alliance to counter developed nations|work=@businessline|access-date=2018-02-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 30, 2016, the alliance entered into a partnership with the [[World Bank]] for accelerating mobilization of finance for solar energy — an estimated US$1000 billion in investments that will be needed by 2030, to meet [[International Solar Alliance|ISA]]'s goals for the massive deployment of affordable solar energy worldwide.

At the World Future Energy Summit (WFES) held in Abu Dhabi in January 2018, the government of India announced the setting up of a $350 million solar development fund to enable financing of solar projects.

Germany is among the top 4 ranking countries in terms of installed photovoltaic solar capacity and number one regarding per capita installation of PV. The overall capacity has reached 42.98 [[gigawatts]] (GW) by the end of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy-charts.de/power_inst.htm|title=Installed power in Germany {{!}} Energy Charts|website=energy-charts.de|language=en|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/DE/Sachgebiete/ElektrizitaetundGas/Unternehmen_Institutionen/ErneuerbareEnergien/Photovoltaik/DatenMeldgn_EEG-VergSaetze/DatenMeldgn_EEG-VergSaetze_node.html Bundesnetzagentur – Photovoltaikanlagen: Datenmeldungen sowie EEG-Vergütungssätze] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; Photovoltaics contribute almost 6% to the national electricity demands. Germany has seen an outstanding period of photovoltaic installations from 2010 until 2012. During this boom, about 22 GW, or a third of the worldwide PV installations of that period was deployed in Germany alone. However, the boom period ended in 2012, and Germany's national PV market has since declined significantly, due to the amendments in the [[German Renewable Energy Act]] (EEG) that reduced [[feed-in tariff]]s and set constraints on utility-scaled installations, limiting their size to no more than 10 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changes for solar in Germany|url=http://www.renewablesinternational.net/changes-for-solar-in-germany/150/452/77990/|publisher=renewablesinternational.net|accessdate=12 May 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PWAqoX0R?url=http://www.renewablesinternational.net/changes-for-solar-in-germany/150/452/77990/|archivedate=12 May 2014|date=3 April 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current version of the [[German Renewable Energy Act|EEG]] only guarantees financial assistance as long as the overall PV capacity has not yet reached 52 GW. It also foresees to regulate annual PV growth within a range of 2.5 GW to 3.5 GW by adjusting the guaranteed fees accordingly. The legislative reforms stipulates a 40 to 45 percent share from renewable energy sources by 2025 and a 55 to 60 percent share by 2035.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmwi.de/DE/Themen/Energie/Erneuerbare-Energien/eeg-reform.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Solar power in Spain}}

[[Spain]] was an early adopter in the development of solar energy, since it is one of the countries of Europe with more hours of sunshine. The Spanish government committed to achieving a target of 12&amp;nbsp;percent of primary energy from renewable energy by 2010 with an installed solar generating capacity of 3000&amp;nbsp;[[megawatts]] (MW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.enn.com/energy/article/38265 |title= Spain expects 3,000 MW in solar plants by 2010 |date= September 25, 2008 |website= |publisher= Environmental News Network |accessdate= 2011-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain is the top tenth in the installed PV solar capacity and used to export 80&amp;nbsp;percent of solar power output to [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="sunny"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jun2006/2006-06-30-02.asp | title= Sunny Spain to Host Europe's First Large Solar Thermal Plant |date= June 30, 2006 |publisher= Environment News Service | accessdate= 2011-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Total solar power in [[Spain]] reached nearly 7&amp;nbsp;GW by the end of 2016 including both installed PV and CSP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ree.es/es/estadisticas-del-sistema-electrico-espanol/series-estadisticas/series-estadisticas-nacionales|title=Red Eléctrica de España {{!}} Series estadísticas nacionales|website=ree.es|language=es|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 8 TWh of electricity was generated from photovoltaics, and 5 TWh from CSP plants in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ree.es/en/statistical-data-of-spanish-electrical-system/statistical-series/national-statistical-series|title=National statistical series {{!}} Red Eléctrica de España|website=ree.es|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solar PV accounted for nearly 3% of total electricity generation in 2016 along with an additional of 1.9% from solar thermal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/index.php?id=6|title=iea-pvps.org - Annual Reports|website=iea-pvps.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through a ministerial ruling in March 2004, the Spanish government removed economic barriers to the connection of renewable energy technologies to the electricity grid. The Royal Decree 436/2004 equalized conditions for large-scale [[solar thermal]] and [[photovoltaic]] plants and guaranteed [[Feed-in Tariff|feed-in tariffs]], which led to a boost in solar power adoption in Spain.&lt;ref name="spain"&gt;[http://spider.iea.org/impagr/cip/pdf/issue36solarp.pdf Spain pioneers grid-connected solar-tower thermal power] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927184114/http://spider.iea.org/impagr/cip/pdf/issue36solarp.pdf |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the [[2008–2009 Spanish financial crisis|2008 financial crisis]], the Spanish government drastically cut its subsidies for solar power and capped future increases in capacity at 500&amp;nbsp;MW per year leading to a stagnation in the new installations.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125193815050081615 | title= Spain's Solar-Power Collapse Dims Subsidy Model | first= Angel | last= Gonzalez |author2=Keith Johnson | date= September 8, 2009 | work= [[The Wall Street Journal]] | accessdate= 2011-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada has many regions that are sparsely populated and difficult to access, but also does not have optimal access to sunlight given the high latitudes of much of the country. Photovoltaic cells are increasingly used as standalone units, mostly as off-grid distributed electricity generation to power remote homes, telecommunications equipment, oil and pipeline monitoring stations and navigational devices.

{{update-section|date=April 2015}}
Mexico was the greatest solar energy producer in Latin America until passed by Chile. It is planning a [[solar trough]] based plant with 30&amp;nbsp;MW which will use a [[combined cycle]] gas turbine about 400&amp;nbsp;MW to provide electricity to the city of Agua Prieta, Sonora. To date, the World Bank has given US$50&amp;nbsp;million to finance this project.&lt;ref&gt;

Solar power in the United States includes utility-scale [[solar power plants]] as well as local [[distributed generation]], mostly from rooftop [[photovoltaics]]. Installations have been growing rapidly in recent years as costs have declined with the U.S. hitting 76 [[Gigawatt|GW]] of installed solar PV capacity at the end of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-us-residential-solar-market-got-its-mojo-back-in-2019|title= The US Built 13.3GW of Solar Last Year as the Residential Market Regained Its Stride
|publisher= Greentech Media|date= March 17, 2020 |accessdate= April 28, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The United States is in the top 4 ranking for countries with the most solar PV installed. The American [[Solar Energy Industries Association]] projects that total solar PV capacity will reach over 100 GW by 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news	|url= http://www.seia.org/news/us-solar-market-set-grow-119-2016-installations-reach-16-gw|title= Solar Market Set to Grow 119% in 2016, Installations to Reach 16 GW|publisher= Solar Energy Industries Association|date= March 9, 2016 |accessdate= March 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrical generation has been rising in tandem with capacity as U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] data show that utility-scale solar power generated 1.8% of total U.S. electricity in 2019, up from &lt;0.1% in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news	|url= https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3|title= What is U.S. electricity generation by energy source?|publisher= U.S. Energy Information Administration|date= February 27, 2020 |accessdate= April 28, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_1_1_a Table 1.1.A.

Net Generation by Energy Source: Total (All Sectors), 2005-December 2015], accessed 11. Mar 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; 
This figure is even higher in certain states, already reaching over 10% of generation in five states (California, Hawaii, Nevada, Massachusetts, and Vermont).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.seia.org/states-map|title= Solar State By State (Q4 2019 data)|publisher= Solar Energy Industries Association|date= March 2020 |accessdate= April 28, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States conducted much early research in photovoltaics and concentrated solar power and is among the top countries in the world in deploying the technology, [[List of photovoltaic power stations#World's largest photovoltaic power stations|being home to 4 of the 10 largest utility-scale photovoltaic power stations in the world]] as of 2017. The energy resource continues to be encouraged through official policy with 29 states having set mandatory [[Renewable portfolio standard|renewable energy targets]] as of October 2015, solar power being specifically included in 20 of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://ncsolarcen-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Renewable-Portfolio-Standards.pdf |title = Renewable Portfolio Standard Policies - October 2015 |publisher = Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency |date = October 2015 |accessdate = March 11, 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160312073518/http://ncsolarcen-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Renewable-Portfolio-Standards.pdf |archive-date = 2016-03-12 |url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://ncsolarcen-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RPS-carveout-map2.pdf |title = Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) with Solar or Distributed Generation Provisions - August 2015 |publisher = Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency |date = August 2015 |accessdate = March 11, 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150919071704/http://ncsolarcen-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RPS-carveout-map2.pdf |archive-date = 2015-09-19 |url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Aside from utility projects, roughly 784,000 homes and businesses in the nation have installed solar systems through the second quarter of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-industry-data|title= Solar Industry Data|publisher= Solar Energy Industries Association|date= September 2015 |accessdate= March 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oceania==
A number of Pacific island states have committed to high percentages of renewable energy use, both to serve as an example to other countries and to cut the high costs of imported fuels. A number of solar installations have been financed and assisted by Japan, New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates. Solar farms have gone online in [[Renewable energy in Tuvalu|Tuvalu]], [[Fiji]] and [[Kiribati]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/business/energy/masdar-and-new-zealand-to-develop-solar-plant-in-solomon-islands Masdar and New Zealand to develop solar plant in Solomon Islands], ''The National'' (Abu Dhabi), October 23, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; UAE-Pacific Partnership Fund solar projects completed by [[Masdar]] in 2016 included: 1MW in the [[Solomon Islands]], 500&amp;nbsp;kW in [[Nauru]], 600&amp;nbsp;kW in the [[Marshall Islands]], 600&amp;nbsp;kW in [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]] and a 450&amp;nbsp;kW solar-diesel hybrid plant in [[Palau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/business/energy/masdar-completes-five-solar-and-wind-projects-in-the-pacific Masdar completes five solar and wind projects in the Pacific], ''The National'', Abu Dhabi Media, LeAnne Graves, May 17, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wam.ae/en/news/emirates/1395295579132.html UAE-Pacific Partnership Fund accomplishes 11 clean energy projects delivered by Masdar] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517105738/http://www.wam.ae/en/news/emirates/1395295579132.html |date=2016-05-17 }}, Emirates News Agency, 17 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; American Samoa has 2 MW of solar installed at Pago Pago Airport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/279857/american-samoa-embracing-more-solar-power American Samoa embracing more solar power], Radio New Zealand, 28 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{main|Solar power in Australia}}
[[File:Broken Hill solar plant aerial.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Broken Hill Solar Plant]], New South Wales]]
Australia had over 13,904 megawatts (MW) of installed photovoltaic (PV) solar power by September 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pv-map.apvi.org.au/analyses|title=Australian PV market since April 2001|work=apvi.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest solar power station in [[Australia]] is the 220 MW [[Bungala Solar Power Project|Bungala]] solar plant. Other significant solar arrays include the 168 Daydream Solar Farm, 150 MW Coleambally Solar Farm, 124 MW [[Sun Metals Solar Farm]] and the 110 MW [[Darling Downs Solar Farm]].

A 9 MW&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; (megawatts, electrical) solar thermal `coal saver' system was constructed at Liddell power station. The system used `compact linear Fresnel reflector' technology developed in Australia. It provided solar-powered steam to the 600&amp;nbsp;MW black coal power station's boiler [[feedwater heater]]. By 2016, it was "effectively" closed and an effort to build a similar 40 MW solar boost at Kogan Creek coal power station was stopped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reneweconomy.com.au/2016/cs-energy-pulls-plug-on-worlds-largest-solar-booster-project-16737 CS Energy pulls plug on world's largest "solar booster" project], Renew Economy, Giles Parkinson, 21 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
{{main|Solar power in New Zealand}}

Solar power in New Zealand currently only generates 0.1 percent of New Zealand's electricity since more emphasis has been placed on hydroelectric, geothermal, and wind power in New Zealand's push for renewable energy. Solar power systems were installed in 42 schools in New Zealand in the Schoolgen program, a program developed by [[Genesis Energy Limited|Genesis Energy]] to educate students in solar power. Each participating school has a 2&amp;nbsp;kW solar panel. Between February 2007 and 29 December 29, 2012, 395.714 MWh were produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoolgen.co.nz/ Schoolgen]&lt;/ref&gt;
