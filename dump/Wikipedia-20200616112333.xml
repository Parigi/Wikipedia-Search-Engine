{{Chromosome}}
In [[biology]], a '''gene''' is a sequence of [[nucleotides]] in [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] that [[genetic code|encodes]] the [[Translation (biology)|synthesis]] of a [[gene product]], either RNA or [[protein]].

During [[gene expression]], the DNA is first [[Transcription (biology)|copied into RNA]]. The RNA can be [[Non-coding RNA|directly functional]] or be the intermediate [[Protein biosynthesis|template]] for a [[protein]] that performs a function. The transmission of genes to an organism's [[offspring]] is the basis of the inheritance of [[phenotypic trait]]. These genes make up different DNA sequences called [[genotype]]s. Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be. Most biological traits are under the influence of [[polygene]]s (many different genes) as well as [[gene–environment interaction]]s. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as [[eye color]] or the number of limbs, and some are not, such as [[blood type]], risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] processes that constitute [[life]].

Genes can acquire [[mutation]]s in their sequence, leading to different variants, known as [[allele]]s, in the [[population]]. These alleles encode slightly different versions of a protein, which cause different [[phenotypical]] traits. Usage of the term "having a gene" (e.g., "good genes," "hair colour gene") typically refers to containing a different allele of the same, shared gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Elston RC, Satagopan JM, Sun S | title = Statistical Human Genetics | chapter = Genetic terminology | series = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 850 | pages = 1–9 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22307690 | pmc = 4450815 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-61779-555-8_1 | isbn = 978-1-61779-554-1 | publisher = Humana Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Genes [[evolution|evolve]] due to [[natural selection]] / [[survival of the fittest]] and genetic drift of the alleles.

The concept of gene continues to be refined as new phenomena are discovered.&lt;ref name=Gericke/&gt; For example, [[Regulatory sequence|regulatory regions]] of a gene can be far removed from its [[coding region]]s, and coding regions can be split into several [[exon]]s. Some [[RNA virus|viruses]] store their [[genome]] in [[RNA]] instead of DNA and some gene products are functional [[non-coding RNA]]s. Therefore, a broad, modern working definition of a gene is any discrete [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] of heritable, genomic sequence which affect an organism's traits by being [[Gene expression|expressed]] as a functional product or by [[regulation of gene expression]].&lt;ref name="Pearson_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pearson H | title = Genetics: what is a gene? | journal = Nature | volume = 441 | issue = 7092 | pages = 398–401 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16724031 | doi = 10.1038/441398a | bibcode = 2006Natur.441..398P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rethink"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pennisi E | title = Genomics.

The term ''gene'' was introduced by Danish [[botanist]], plant physiologist and [[geneticist]] [[Wilhelm Johannsen]] in 1909.&lt;ref name=Johannsen&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Johannsen W | date = 1905 | title = Arvelighedslærens elementer | trans-title = The Elements of Heredity | language = Danish | location = Copenhagen }} Rewritten, enlarged and translated into German as {{cite book | vauthors = Johannsen W  | title = Elemente der exakten Erblichkeitslehre | location = Jena | publisher = Gustav Fischer | date = &lt;!--1905--&gt;1909 | url = http://caliban.mpiz-koeln.mpg.de/~stueber/johannsen/elemente/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is inspired by the [[ancient Greek]]: γόνος, ''gonos'', that means offspring and procreation.

{{main|History of genetics}}

=== Discovery of discrete inherited units ===

The existence of discrete inheritable units  was first suggested by [[Gregor Mendel]] (1822–1884).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Noble D | title = Genes and causation | journal = Philosophical Transactions. Series A, Mathematical, Physical, and Engineering Sciences | volume = 366 | issue = 1878 | pages = 3001–15 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18559318 | doi = 10.1098/rsta.2008.0086 |doi-access = free | bibcode = 2008RSPTA.366.3001N }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1857 to 1864, in [[Brno]], [[Austrian Empire]] (today's Czech Republic), he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible [[pea plant]]s, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;combinations where n is the number of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term ''gene'', he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured [[Wilhelm Johannsen]]'s distinction between [[genotype]] (the genetic material of an organism) and [[phenotype]] (the observable traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate [[independent assortment]], the distinction between [[dominant gene|dominant]] and [[recessive]] traits, the distinction between a [[heterozygote]] and [[homozygote]], and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.

Prior to Mendel's work, the dominant theory of heredity was one of [[blending inheritance]], which suggested that each parent contributed fluids to the fertilisation process and that the traits of the parents blended and mixed to produce the offspring. [[Charles Darwin]] developed a theory of inheritance he termed [[pangenesis]], from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] pan ("all, whole") and genesis ("birth") / genos ("origin").&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|genesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Magner |first = Lois N. | name-list-format = vanc |title = A History of the Life Sciences |edition = Third |publisher = [[Marcel Dekker]], [[CRC Press]] |year = 2002 |isbn = 978-0-203-91100-6 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin used the term ''[[gemmule (pangenesis)|gemmule]]'' to describe hypothetical particles that would mix during reproduction.

Mendel's work went largely unnoticed after its first publication in 1866, but was rediscovered in the late 19th century by [[Hugo de Vries]], [[Carl Correns]], and [[Erich von Tschermak]], who (claimed to have) reached similar conclusions in their own research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Henig |first=Robin Marantz | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Monk in the Garden: The Lost and Found Genius of Gregor Mendel, the Father of Genetics |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=2000 |isbn=978-0395-97765-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/monkingardenlost00heni/page/n14 1]–9 |url=https://archive.org/details/monkingardenlost00heni |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, in 1889, Hugo de Vries published his book ''Intracellular Pangenesis'',&lt;ref name = "de_Vries_1889"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = de Vries H | author-link1 = Hugo de Vries | title = Intracellulare Pangenese | trans-title = Intracellular Pangenesis | language = German | publisher =  Verlag von Gustav Fischer | location = Jena | date = 1889 | translator-last1= Gager |translator-first1= C.

De Vries called these units "pangenes" (''Pangens'' in German), after Darwin's 1868 pangenesis theory.

Sixteen years later, in 1905, Wilhelm Johannsen introduced the term 'gene'&lt;ref name="Johannsen"/&gt; and [[William Bateson]] that of '[[genetics]]'&lt;ref name="Gerstein"/&gt; while [[Eduard Strasburger]], amongst others, still used the term 'pangene' for the fundamental physical and functional unit of heredity.&lt;ref name = "de_Vries_1889"/&gt;{{rp|Translator's preface, viii}}

=== Discovery of DNA ===

Advances in understanding genes and inheritance continued throughout the 20th century. [[Deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) was shown to be the molecular repository of genetic information by experiments in the 1940s to 1950s.&lt;ref name=Avery_et_al&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Avery OT, Macleod CM, McCarty M | title = Studies on the Chemical Nature of the Substance Inducing Transformation of Pneumococcal Types : Induction of Transformation by a Desoxyribonucleic Acid Fraction Isolated From Pneumococcus Type III | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–58 | date = February 1944 | pmid = 19871359 | pmc = 2135445 | doi = 10.1084/jem.79.2.137 }} Reprint: {{cite journal | vauthors = Avery OT, MacLeod CM, McCarty M | title = Studies on the chemical nature of the substance inducing transformation of pneumococcal types.

Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] to publish a model of the double-stranded DNA molecule whose paired [[nucleotide base]]s indicated a compelling hypothesis for the mechanism of genetic replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Eighth Day of Creation: Makers of the Revolution in Biology |last=Judson |first=Horace | name-list-format = vanc |authorlink=Horace Freeland Judson |year=1979 |publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press |isbn=978-0-87969-477-7 |pages=51–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=watsoncrick_1953a&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Watson JD, Crick FH | title = Molecular structure of nucleic acids; a structure for deoxyribose nucleic acid | journal = Nature | volume = 171 | issue = 4356 | pages = 737–8 | date = April 1953 | pmid = 13054692 | doi = 10.1038/171737a0 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf | bibcode = 1953Natur.171..737W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s the prevailing view was that the genes in a chromosome acted like discrete entities, indivisible by recombination and arranged like beads on a string. The experiments of [[Seymour Benzer|Benzer]] using [[mutant]]s defective in the [[T4 rII system|rII region of bacteriophage T4]] (1955–1959) showed that individual genes have a simple linear structure and are likely to be equivalent to a linear section of DNA.&lt;ref name="pmid16589677"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benzer S | title = Fine Structure of a Genetic Region in Bacteriophage | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 41 | issue = 6 | pages = 344–54 | date = June 1955 | pmid = 16589677 | pmc = 528093 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.41.6.344 | bibcode = 1955PNAS...41..344B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16590553"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benzer S | title = On the Topology of the Genetic Fine Structure | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 45 | issue = 11 | pages = 1607–20 | date = November 1959 | pmid = 16590553 | pmc = 222769 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.45.11.1607 | bibcode = 1959PNAS...45.1607B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectively, this body of research established the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], which states that [[protein]]s are translated from [[RNA]], which is transcribed from [[DNA]]. This dogma has since been shown to have exceptions, such as [[reverse transcription]] in [[retrovirus]]es. The modern study of [[genetics]] at the level of DNA is known as [[molecular genetics]].

In 1972, [[Walter Fiers]] and his team were the first to determine the sequence of a gene: that of [[Bacteriophage MS2]] coat protein.&lt;ref name=Min_1972&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Min Jou W, Haegeman G, Ysebaert M, Fiers W | title = Nucleotide sequence of the gene coding for the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein | journal = Nature | volume = 237 | issue = 5350 | pages = 82–8 | date = May 1972 | pmid = 4555447 | doi = 10.1038/237082a0 | bibcode = 1972Natur.237...82J }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent development of [[Sanger sequencing|chain-termination]] [[DNA sequencing]] in 1977 by [[Frederick Sanger]] improved the efficiency of sequencing and turned it into a routine laboratory tool.&lt;ref name=sanger_et_al&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanger F, Nicklen S, Coulson AR | title = DNA sequencing with chain-terminating inhibitors | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 74 | issue = 12 | pages = 5463–7 | date = December 1977 | pmid = 271968 | pmc = 431765 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.74.12.5463 | bibcode = 1977PNAS...74.5463S }}&lt;/ref&gt; An automated version of the Sanger method was used in early phases of the [[Human Genome Project]].&lt;ref name=scitable_adams&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Jill U.|title=DNA Sequencing Technologies|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/dna-sequencing-technologies-690|journal=Nature Education Knowledge|date=2008|volume=1|issue=1|page=193|series=SciTable|publisher=Nature Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern synthesis and its successors===
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}

The theories developed in the early 20th century to integrate [[Mendelian genetics]] with [[Darwinian evolution]] are called the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], a term introduced by [[Julian Huxley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huxley |first1=Julian | name-list-format = vanc |title=Evolution: the Modern Synthesis |date=1942 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0262513661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary biologists have subsequently modified this concept, such as [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]]' [[gene-centered view of evolution|gene-centric view of evolution]]. He proposed an evolutionary concept of the gene as a [[unit of selection|unit]] of [[natural selection]] with the definition: "that which segregates and recombines with appreciable frequency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=George C. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Adaptation and Natural Selection a Critique of Some Current Evolutionary Thought |date=2001 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=9781400820108 |edition=Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}} In this view, the molecular gene ''transcribes'' as a unit, and the evolutionary gene ''inherits'' as a unit. Related ideas emphasizing the centrality of genes in evolution were popularized by [[Richard Dawkins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dawkins |first1=Richard | name-list-format = vanc |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The selfish gene |date=1977 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London |isbn=978-0-19-857519-1 |edition=Repr.

The [[deoxyribose|sugar]]-[[phosphate]] backbone chains run in opposite directions with the [[nucleobase|bases]] pointing inwards, [[base-pair]]ing [[adenine|A]] to [[thymine|T]] and [[cytosine|C]] to [[guanine|G]] with [[hydrogen bond]]s.

=== DNA ===
The vast majority of organisms encode their genes in long strands of [[DNA]] (deoxyribonucleic acid). DNA consists of a [[polymer|chain]] made from four types of [[nucleotide]] subunits, each composed of: a five-carbon sugar ([[deoxyribose|2-deoxyribose]]), a [[phosphate]] group, and one of the four [[nucleobase|bases]] [[adenine]], [[cytosine]], [[guanine]], and [[thymine]].&lt;ref name="MBOC"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Bruce | last1 = Alberts | first2 = Alexander | last2 = Johnson | first3 = Julian | last3 = Lewis | first4 = Martin | last4 = Raff | first5 = Keith | last5 = Roberts | first6 = Peter | last6 = Walter | name-list-format = vanc | author1-link = Bruce Alberts | author3-link = Julian Lewis (biologist) | author4-link = Martin Raff | author6-link = Peter Walter | title = Molecular Biology of the Cell | edition = Fourth | publisher = Garland Science | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-8153-3218-3 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21054/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2.1}}

Two chains of DNA twist around each other to form a DNA [[double helix]] with the phosphate-sugar backbone spiralling around the outside, and the bases pointing inwards with adenine [[base pairing]] to thymine and guanine to cytosine. The specificity of base pairing occurs because adenine and thymine align to form two [[hydrogen bond]]s, whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands in a double helix must, therefore, be [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]], with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand, and so on.&lt;ref name=MBOC/&gt;{{rp|4.1}}

Due to the chemical composition of the [[pentose]] residues of the bases, DNA strands have directionality. One end of a DNA polymer contains an exposed [[hydroxyl]] group on the [[deoxyribose]]; this is known as the [[3'&amp;nbsp;end]] of the molecule. The other end contains an exposed [[phosphate]] group; this is the [[5'&amp;nbsp;end]]. The two strands of a double-helix run in opposite directions. Nucleic acid synthesis, including [[DNA replication]] and [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] occurs in the 5'→3'&amp;nbsp;direction, because new nucleotides are added via a [[dehydration reaction]] that uses the exposed 3'&amp;nbsp;hydroxyl as a [[nucleophile]].&lt;ref name = "Stryer_2002"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Stryer L, Berg JM, Tymoczko JL | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H. Freeman | location = San Francisco | year = 2002 | edition = 5th | isbn = 978-0-7167-4955-4 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21154/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27.2}}

The [[gene expression|expression]] of genes encoded in DNA begins by [[transcription (genetics)|transcribing]] the gene into [[RNA]], a second type of nucleic acid that is very similar to DNA, but whose monomers contain the sugar [[ribose]] rather than [[deoxyribose]]. RNA also contains the base [[uracil]] in place of [[thymine]]. RNA molecules are less stable than DNA and are typically single-stranded. Genes that encode proteins are composed of a series of three-[[nucleotide]] sequences called [[codon]]s, which serve as the "words" in the genetic "language". The [[genetic code]] specifies the correspondence during [[translation (genetics)|protein translation]] between codons and [[amino acid]]s. The genetic code is nearly the same for all known organisms.&lt;ref name=MBOC/&gt;{{rp|4.1}}

=== Chromosomes ===

The total complement of genes in an organism or cell is known as its [[genome]], which may be stored on one or more [[chromosome]]s. A chromosome consists of a single, very long DNA helix on which thousands of genes are encoded.&lt;ref name=MBOC/&gt;{{rp|4.2}} The region of the chromosome at which a particular gene is located is called its [[locus (genetics)|locus]]. Each locus contains one [[allele]] of a gene; however, members of a population may have different alleles at the locus, each with a slightly different gene sequence.

The majority of [[eukaryotic]] genes are stored on a set of large, linear chromosomes. The chromosomes are packed within the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] in complex with storage proteins called [[histone]]s to form a unit called a [[nucleosome]]. DNA packaged and condensed in this way is called [[chromatin]].&lt;ref name=MBOC/&gt;{{rp|4.2}} The manner in which DNA is stored on the histones, as well as chemical modifications of the histone itself, regulate whether a particular region of DNA is accessible for [[gene expression]]. In addition to genes, eukaryotic chromosomes contain sequences involved in ensuring that the DNA is copied without degradation of end regions and sorted into daughter cells during cell division: [[replication origin]]s, [[telomere]]s and the [[centromere]].&lt;ref name=MBOC/&gt;{{rp|4.2}} Replication origins are the sequence regions where [[DNA replication]] is initiated to make two copies of the chromosome. Telomeres are long stretches of repetitive sequence that cap the ends of the linear chromosomes and prevent degradation of coding and regulatory regions during [[DNA replication]]. The length of the telomeres decreases each time the genome is replicated and has been implicated in the [[aging]] process.&lt;ref name="Braig"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Braig M, Schmitt CA | title = Oncogene-induced senescence: putting the brakes on tumor development | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 66 | issue = 6 | pages = 2881–4 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16540631 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-4006 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The centromere is required for binding [[spindle fibre]]s to separate sister chromatids into daughter cells during [[cell division]].&lt;ref name=MBOC/&gt;{{rp|18.2}}

[[Prokaryote]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]) typically store their genomes on a single large, [[DNA supercoil|circular chromosome]]. Similarly, some eukaryotic [[organelles]] contain a remnant circular chromosome with a small number of genes.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|14.4}} Prokaryotes sometimes supplement their chromosome with additional small circles of DNA called [[plasmid]]s, which usually encode only a few genes and are transferable between individuals.

&lt;!-- this would be a good place for a table of % 'junk' or similar --&gt;

Whereas the chromosomes of prokaryotes are relatively gene-dense, those of eukaryotes often contain regions of DNA that serve no obvious function.

The [[gene structure|structure of a gene]] consists of many elements of which the actual [[coding region|protein coding sequence]] is often only a small part. These include DNA regions that are not transcribed as well as untranslated regions of the RNA.

Flanking the open reading frame, genes contain a [[regulatory sequence]] that is required for their expression. First, genes require a [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] sequence. The promoter is recognized and bound by [[transcription factors]] that recruit and help [[RNA polymerase]] bind to the region to initiate transcription.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|7.1}} The recognition typically occurs as a [[consensus sequence]] like the [[TATA box]].  A gene can have more than one promoter, resulting in messenger RNAs ([[mRNA]]) that differ in how far they extend in the 5'&amp;nbsp;end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mortazavi A, Williams BA, McCue K, Schaeffer L, Wold B | title = Mapping and quantifying mammalian transcriptomes by RNA-Seq | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 5 | issue = 7 | pages = 621–8 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18516045 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.1226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Highly transcribed genes have "strong" promoter sequences that form strong associations with transcription factors, thereby initiating transcription at a high rate. Others genes have "weak" promoters that form weak associations with transcription factors and initiate transcription less frequently.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|7.2}} [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic]] [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] regions are much more complex and difficult to identify than [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] promoters.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|7.3}}

Additionally, genes can have regulatory regions many kilobases upstream or downstream of the open reading frame that alter expression. These act by [[DNA binding site|binding]] to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site.&lt;ref name="5questions"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pennacchio LA, Bickmore W, Dean A, Nobrega MA, Bejerano G | title = Enhancers: five essential questions | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 288–95 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23503198 | pmc = 4445073 | doi = 10.1038/nrg3458 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]] increase transcription by binding an [[Activator (genetics)|activator]] protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely [[Silencer (DNA)|silencers]] bind [[repressor]] proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maston GA, Evans SK, Green MR | title = Transcriptional regulatory elements in the human genome | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 7 | pages = 29–59 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16719718 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.7.080505.115623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequences at the ends of the introns dictate the [[splice site]]s to generate the final [[mature mRNA]] which encodes the protein or RNA product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bicknell AA, Cenik C, Chua HN, Roth FP, Moore MJ | title = Introns in UTRs: why we should stop ignoring them | journal = BioEssays | volume = 34 | issue = 12 | pages = 1025–34 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23108796 | doi = 10.1002/bies.201200073 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early work in molecular genetics suggested the concept that [[one gene-one enzyme hypothesis|one gene makes one protein]].

== Gene expression ==
{{main|Gene expression}}

In all organisms, two steps are required to read the information encoded in a gene's DNA and produce the protein it specifies. First, the gene's DNA is ''[[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]]'' to messenger RNA ([[mRNA]]).&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|6.1}} Second, that mRNA is ''[[translation (genetics)|translated]]'' to protein.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|6.2}} RNA-coding genes must still go through the first step, but are not translated into protein.&lt;ref name="Edd01" /&gt; The process of producing a biologically functional molecule of either RNA or protein is called [[gene expression]], and the resulting molecule is called a [[gene product]].

=== Genetic code ===
[[File:RNA-codons-aminoacids.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Schematic of a single-stranded RNA molecule illustrating a series of three-base [[codon]]s. Each three-[[nucleotide]] codon corresponds to an [[amino acid]] when translated to protein|alt=An RNA molecule consisting of nucleotides. Groups of three nucleotides are indicated as codons, with each corresponding to a specific amino acid.]]

The nucleotide sequence of a gene's DNA specifies the amino acid sequence of a protein through the [[genetic code]]. Sets of three nucleotides, known as [[codon]]s, each correspond to a specific amino acid.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{Rp|6}} The principle that three sequential bases of DNA code for each amino acid was demonstrated in 1961 using frameshift mutations in the rIIB gene of bacteriophage T4&lt;ref name="pmid13882203"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crick FH, Barnett L, Brenner S, Watts-Tobin RJ | title = General nature of the genetic code for proteins | journal = Nature | volume = 192 | issue = 4809 | pages = 1227–32 | date = December 1961 | pmid = 13882203 | doi = 10.1038/1921227a0 | bibcode = 1961Natur.192.1227C }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Crick, Brenner et al. experiment]]).

Additionally, a "[[start codon]]", and three "[[stop codon]]s" indicate the beginning and end of the [[Coding region|protein coding region]]. There are 64&amp;nbsp;possible codons (four possible nucleotides at each of three positions, hence 4&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;possible codons) and only 20&amp;nbsp;standard amino acids; hence the code is redundant and multiple codons can specify the same amino acid. The correspondence between codons and amino acids is nearly universal among all known living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crick FH | title = The genetic code | journal = Scientific American | volume = 207 | issue = 4 | pages = 66–74 | date = October 1962 | pmid = 13882204 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican1062-66 | url = http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/access/SCBBFY.ocr | publisher = WH Freeman and Company | bibcode = 1962SciAm.207d..66C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transcription ===
[[transcription (genetics)|Transcription]] produces a single-stranded [[RNA]] molecule known as [[messenger RNA]], whose nucleotide sequence is complementary to the DNA from which it was transcribed.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|6.1}} The mRNA acts as an intermediate between the DNA gene and its final protein product. The gene's DNA is used as a template to generate a [[Base pair|complementary]] mRNA. The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA [[coding strand]] because it is synthesised as the complement of the [[template strand]]. Transcription is performed by an [[enzyme]] called an [[RNA polymerase]], which reads the template strand in the [[3' end|3']] to [[5' end|5']]&amp;nbsp;direction and synthesizes the RNA from [[5' end|5']] to [[3' end|3']]. To initiate transcription, the polymerase first recognizes and binds a [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] region of the gene. Thus, a major mechanism of [[gene regulation]] is the blocking or sequestering the promoter region, either by tight binding by [[repressor]] molecules that physically block the polymerase, or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

In [[prokaryote]]s, transcription occurs in the [[cytoplasm]]; for very long transcripts, translation may begin at the 5'&amp;nbsp;end of the RNA while the 3'&amp;nbsp;end is still being transcribed. In [[eukaryote]]s, transcription occurs in the nucleus, where the cell's DNA is stored. The RNA molecule produced by the polymerase is known as the [[primary transcript]] and undergoes [[post-transcriptional modification]]s before being exported to the cytoplasm for translation. One of the modifications performed is the [[splicing (genetics)|splicing]] of [[intron]]s which are sequences in the transcribed region that do not encode protein. [[Alternative splicing]] mechanisms can result in mature transcripts from the same gene having different sequences and thus coding for different proteins. This is a major form of regulation in eukaryotic cells and also occurs in some prokaryotes.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|7.5}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Woodson SA | title = Ironing out the kinks: splicing and translation in bacteria | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 12 | issue = 9 | pages = 1243–7 | date = May 1998 | pmid = 9573040 | doi = 10.1101/gad.12.9.1243 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation===

RNA-coding genes are transcribed to a functional [[non-coding RNA]]. ({{PDB|3BSE|1OBB|3TRA}})|alt=A protein-coding gene in DNA being transcribed and translated to a functional protein or a non-protein-coding gene being transcribed to a functional RNA]] [[Translation (genetics)|Translation]] is the process by which a [[Mature messenger RNA|mature mRNA]] molecule is used as a template for synthesizing a new [[protein]].&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|6.2}} Translation is carried out by [[ribosome]]s, large complexes of RNA and protein responsible for carrying out the chemical reactions to add new [[amino acid]]s to a growing [[polypeptide chain]] by the formation of [[peptide bond]]s. The genetic code is read three nucleotides at a time, in units called [[codon]]s, via interactions with specialized RNA molecules called [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA). Each tRNA has three unpaired bases known as the [[anticodon]] that are complementary to the codon it reads on the mRNA. The tRNA is also [[covalent]]ly attached to the [[amino acid]] specified by the complementary codon. When the tRNA binds to its complementary codon in an mRNA strand, the ribosome attaches its amino acid cargo to the new polypeptide chain, which is synthesized from [[N-terminus|amino terminus]] to [[C-terminus|carboxyl terminus]]. During and after synthesis, most new proteins must [[protein folding|fold]] to their active [[tertiary structure|three-dimensional structure]] before they can carry out their cellular functions.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

===Regulation===
[[Regulation of gene expression|Genes are regulated]] so that they are [[gene expression|expressed]] only when the product is needed, since expression draws on limited resources.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|7}} A cell regulates its gene expression depending on its [[Environment (biophysical)|external environment]] (e.g. [[nutrient|available nutrients]], [[Heat shock protein|temperature]] and other [[Cellular stress response|stresses]]), its internal environment (e.g. [[cell division cycle]], [[metabolism]], [[infection|infection status]]), and its [[Cellular differentiation|specific role]] if in a [[multicellular]] organism. Gene expression can be regulated at any step: from [[Transcriptional regulation|transcriptional initiation]], to [[RNA processing]], to [[post-translational modification]] of the protein. The regulation of [[lactose]] metabolism genes in ''[[E. coli]]'' ([[lac operon|''lac'' operon]]) was the first such mechanism to be described in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jacob F, Monod J | title = Genetic regulatory mechanisms in the synthesis of proteins | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 318–56 | date = June 1961 | pmid = 13718526 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-2836(61)80072-7 | authorlink = François Jacob | authorlink2 = Jacques Monod }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RNA genes ===
A typical protein-coding gene is first copied into [[RNA]] as an intermediate in the manufacture of the final protein product.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|6.1}} In other cases, the RNA molecules are the actual functional products, as in the synthesis of [[ribosomal RNA]] and [[transfer RNA]]. Some RNAs known as [[ribozyme]]s are capable of [[enzyme|enzymatic function]], and [[microRNA]] has a regulatory role. The [[DNA]] sequences from which such RNAs are transcribed are known as [[non-coding RNA|non-coding RNA genes]].&lt;ref name="Edd01"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eddy SR | title = Non-coding RNA genes and the modern RNA world | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 919–29 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11733745 | doi = 10.1038/35103511 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inheritance==

Each parent has one blue allele and one white allele. Each of their 4 children inherit one allele from each parent such that one child ends up with two blue alleles, one child has two white alleles and two children have one of each allele. Only the child with both blue alleles shows the trait because the trait is recessive.]]{{main|Mendelian inheritance|Heredity}}Organisms inherit their genes from their parents. [[Asexual reproduction|Asexual]] organisms simply inherit a complete copy of their parent's genome. [[Sexual reproduction|Sexual]] organisms have two copies of each chromosome because they inherit one complete set from each parent.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|1}}

=== Mendelian inheritance ===
According to [[Mendelian inheritance]], variations in an organism's [[phenotype]] (observable physical and behavioral characteristics) are due in part to variations in its [[genotype]] (particular set of genes). Each gene specifies a particular trait with different sequence of a gene ([[alleles]]) giving rise to different phenotypes. Most eukaryotic organisms (such as the pea plants Mendel worked on) have two alleles for each trait, one inherited from each parent.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|20}}

Alleles at a locus may be [[dominant gene|dominant]] or [[recessive gene|recessive]]; dominant alleles give rise to their corresponding phenotypes when paired with any other allele for the same trait, whereas recessive alleles give rise to their corresponding phenotype only when paired with another copy of the same allele. If you know the genotypes of the organisms, you can determine which alleles are dominant and which are recessive. For example, if the allele specifying tall stems in pea plants is dominant over the allele specifying short stems, then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from the other parent will also have tall stems. Mendel's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently in the production of [[gamete]]s, or [[germ cell]]s, ensuring variation in the next generation. Although Mendelian inheritance remains a good model for many traits determined by single genes (including a number of well-known [[Genetic disorder#Single-gene disorder|genetic disorders]]) it does not include the physical processes of DNA replication and cell division.&lt;ref name=scitable_miko&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miko | first1 = Ilona | title = Gregor Mendel and the Principles of Inheritance | url = http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/gregor-mendel-and-the-principles-of-inheritance-593 | journal = Nature Education Knowledge | date = 2008 | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | page = 134 | series = SciTable | publisher = Nature Publishing Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scitable_chial&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chial | first1 = Heidi | title = Mendelian Genetics: Patterns of Inheritance and Single-Gene Disorders | url = http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/mendelian-genetics-patterns-of-inheritance-and-single-966 | journal = Nature Education Knowledge | date = 2008 | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | page = 63 | series = SciTable | publisher = Nature Publishing Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DNA replication and cell division ===
The growth, development, and reproduction of organisms relies on [[cell division]]; the process by which a single [[cell (biology)|cell]] divides into two usually identical [[daughter cell]]s. This requires first making a duplicate copy of every gene in the [[genome]] in a process called [[DNA replication]].&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|5.2}} The copies are made by specialized [[enzyme]]s known as [[DNA polymerase]]s, which "read" one strand of the double-helical DNA, known as the template strand, and synthesize a new complementary strand. Because the DNA double helix is held together by [[base pair]]ing, the sequence of one strand completely specifies the sequence of its complement; hence only one strand needs to be read by the enzyme to produce a faithful copy. The process of DNA replication is [[semiconservative replication|semiconservative]]; that is, the copy of the genome inherited by each daughter cell contains one original and one newly synthesized strand of DNA.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|5.2}}

The rate of DNA replication in living cells was first measured as the rate of phage T4 DNA elongation in phage-infected ''E. coli'' and found to be impressively rapid.&lt;ref name="pmid789903"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCarthy D, Minner C, Bernstein H, Bernstein C | title = DNA elongation rates and growing point distributions of wild-type phage T4 and a DNA-delay amber mutant | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 106 | issue = 4 | pages = 963–81 | date = October 1976 | pmid = 789903 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(76)90346-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of exponential DNA increase at 37&amp;nbsp;°C, the rate of elongation was 749 nucleotides per second.

After DNA replication is complete, the cell must physically separate the two copies of the genome and divide into two distinct membrane-bound cells.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|18.2}} In [[prokaryote]]s&amp;nbsp;([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]) this usually occurs via a relatively simple process called [[binary fission]], in which each circular genome attaches to the [[cell membrane]] and is separated into the daughter cells as the membrane [[invagination|invaginates]] to split the [[cytoplasm]] into two membrane-bound portions. Binary fission is extremely fast compared to the rates of cell division in [[eukaryote]]s. Eukaryotic cell division is a more complex process known as the [[cell cycle]]; DNA replication occurs during a phase of this cycle known as [[S phase]], whereas the process of segregating [[chromosome]]s and splitting the [[cytoplasm]] occurs during [[M phase]].&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|18.1}}

===Molecular inheritance===
The duplication and transmission of genetic material from one generation of cells to the next is the basis for molecular inheritance, and the link between the classical and molecular pictures of genes. Organisms inherit the characteristics of their parents because the cells of the offspring contain copies of the genes in their parents' cells. In [[asexual reproduction|asexually reproducing]] organisms, the offspring will be a genetic copy or [[Clone (genetics)|clone]] of the parent organism. In [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] organisms, a specialized form of cell division called [[meiosis]] produces cells called [[gamete]]s or [[germ cell]]s that are [[haploid]], or contain only one copy of each gene.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|20.2}} The gametes produced by females are called [[egg (biology)|eggs]] or ova, and those produced by males are called [[sperm]]. Two gametes fuse to form a [[diploid]] [[fertilized egg]], a single cell that has two sets of genes, with one copy of each gene from the mother and one from the father.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|20}}

During the process of meiotic cell division, an event called [[genetic recombination]] or ''crossing-over'' can sometimes occur, in which a length of DNA on one [[chromatid]] is swapped with a length of DNA on the corresponding homologous non-sister chromatid. This can result in reassortment of otherwise linked alleles.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|5.5}} The Mendelian principle of independent assortment asserts that each of a parent's two genes for each trait will sort independently into gametes; which allele an organism inherits for one trait is unrelated to which allele it inherits for another trait. This is in fact only true for genes that do not reside on the same chromosome, or are located very far from one another on the same chromosome. The closer two genes lie on the same chromosome, the more closely they will be associated in gametes and the more often they will appear together (known as [[genetic linkage]]).&lt;ref name="scitable_lobo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lobo|first1=Ingrid|last2=Shaw|first2=Kelly | name-list-format = vanc |date=2008|title=Discovery and Types of Genetic Linkage|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/discovery-and-types-of-genetic-linkage-500|journal=Nature Education Knowledge|series=SciTable|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|volume=1|issue=1|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genes that are very close are essentially never separated because it is extremely unlikely that a crossover point will occur between them.&lt;ref name="scitable_lobo" /&gt;

===Mutation===
DNA replication is for the most part extremely accurate, however errors ([[mutations]]) do occur.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|7.6}} The error rate in [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] can be as low as 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; per [[nucleotide]] per replication,&lt;ref name="Nachman"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nachman MW, Crowell SL | title = Estimate of the mutation rate per nucleotide in humans | journal = Genetics | volume = 156 | issue = 1 | pages = 297–304 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 10978293 | pmc = 1461236 | url = http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/156/1/297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Science2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roach JC, Glusman G, Smit AF, Huff CD, Hubley R, Shannon PT, Rowen L, Pant KP, Goodman N, Bamshad M, Shendure J, Drmanac R, Jorde LB, Hood L, Galas DJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Analysis of genetic inheritance in a family quartet by whole-genome sequencing | journal = Science | volume = 328 | issue = 5978 | pages = 636–9 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20220176 | pmc = 3037280 | doi = 10.1126/science.1186802 | bibcode = 2010Sci...328..636R }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas for some RNA viruses it can be as high as 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Genetics2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drake JW, Charlesworth B, Charlesworth D, Crow JF | title = Rates of spontaneous mutation | journal = Genetics | volume = 148 | issue = 4 | pages = 1667–86 | date = April 1998 | pmid = 9560386 | pmc = 1460098 | url = http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/148/4/1667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that each generation, each human genome accumulates 1–2 new mutations.&lt;ref name="Genetics2"/&gt; Small mutations can be caused by [[DNA replication]] and the aftermath of [[DNA repair|DNA damage]] and include [[point mutation]]s in which a single base is altered and [[frameshift mutation]]s in which a single base is inserted or deleted. Either of these mutations can change the gene by [[Missense mutation|missense]] (change a [[codon]] to encode a different amino acid) or [[nonsense mutation|nonsense]] (a premature [[stop codon]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What kinds of gene mutations are possible?|url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/possiblemutations|website=Genetics Home Reference|publisher=United States National Library of Medicine|access-date=19 May 2015|date=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger mutations can be caused by errors in recombination to cause [[chromosomal abnormality|chromosomal abnormalities]] including the [[gene duplication|duplication]], deletion, rearrangement or inversion of large sections of a chromosome. Additionally, DNA repair mechanisms can introduce mutational errors when repairing physical damage to the molecule. The repair, even with mutation, is more important to survival than restoring an exact copy, for example when repairing [[double-strand breaks]].&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|5.4}}

When multiple different [[allele]]s for a gene are present in a species's population it is called [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]]. Most different alleles are functionally equivalent, however some alleles can give rise to different [[phenotypic trait]]s. A gene's most common allele is called the [[wild type]], and rare alleles are called [[mutant]]s. The [[genetic variation]] in relative frequencies of different alleles in a population is due to both [[natural selection]] and [[genetic drift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andrews|first1=Christine A.|title=Natural Selection, Genetic Drift, and Gene Flow Do Not Act in Isolation in Natural Populations|journal=Nature Education Knowledge|date=2010|volume=3|issue=10|page=5|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/natural-selection-genetic-drift-and-gene-flow-15186648|series=SciTable|publisher=Nature Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wild-type allele is not necessarily the [[ancestor]] of less common alleles, nor is it necessarily [[fitness (biology)|fitter]].

Most mutations within genes are [[neutral mutation|neutral]], having no effect on the organism's phenotype ([[silent mutation]]s). Some mutations do not change the amino acid sequence because multiple codons encode the same amino acid ([[synonymous mutations]]). Other mutations can be neutral if they lead to amino acid sequence changes, but the protein still functions similarly with the new amino acid (e.g. [[conservative mutation]]s). Many mutations, however, are [[deleterious mutation|deleterious]] or even [[Lethal allele|lethal]], and are removed from populations by natural selection. Genetic disorders are the result of deleterious mutations and can be due to spontaneous mutation in the affected individual, or can be inherited. Finally, a small fraction of mutations are [[Beneficial mutation|beneficial]], improving the organism's [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] and are extremely important for evolution, since their [[directional selection]] leads to adaptive [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|7.6}}

===Sequence homology===
[[File:Histone Alignment.png|thumb|right|upright=1.8|A sequence alignment, produced by [[ClustalO]], of mammalian [[histone]] proteins]]
Genes with a [[most recent common ancestor]], and thus a shared evolutionary ancestry, are known as [[Sequence homology|homologs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patterson C | title = Homology in classical and molecular biology | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 603–25 | date = November 1988 | pmid = 3065587 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040523 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; These genes appear either from gene duplication within an organism's genome, where they are known as paralogous genes, or are the result of divergence of the genes after a [[speciation]] event, where they are known as orthologous genes,&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|7.6}} and often perform the same or similar functions in related organisms. It is often assumed that the functions of orthologous genes are more similar than those of paralogous genes, although the difference is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Studer RA, Robinson-Rechavi M | title = How confident can we be that orthologs are similar, but paralogs differ? | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 210–6 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19368988 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2009.03.004 | url = https://serval.unil.ch/notice/serval:BIB_39F8106EE698 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Altenhoff AM, Studer RA, Robinson-Rechavi M, Dessimoz C | title = Resolving the ortholog conjecture: orthologs tend to be weakly, but significantly, more similar in function than paralogs | journal = PLOS Computational Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = e1002514 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22615551 | pmc = 3355068 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002514 | bibcode = 2012PLSCB...8E2514A }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between genes can be measured by comparing the [[sequence alignment]] of their DNA.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|7.6}} The degree of sequence similarity between homologous genes is called [[conserved sequence]]. Most changes to a gene's sequence do not affect its function and so genes accumulate mutations over time by [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution|neutral molecular evolution]]. Additionally, any selection on a gene will cause its sequence to diverge at a different rate. Genes under [[stabilizing selection]] are [[Biological constraints|constrained]] and so change more slowly whereas genes under [[directional selection]] change sequence more rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nosil P, Funk DJ, Ortiz-Barrientos D | title = Divergent selection and heterogeneous genomic divergence | journal = Molecular Ecology | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 375–402 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19143936 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03946.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence differences between genes can be used for [[phylogenetic]] analyses to study how those genes have evolved and how the organisms they come from are related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Emery|first1=Laura|title=Introduction to Phylogenetics|date=5 December 2014|url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/course/introduction-phylogenetics|publisher=EMBL-EBI|access-date=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scitable_mitchell&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = Matthew W. | last2 = Gonder | first2 = Mary Katherine | name-list-format = vanc | title = Primate Speciation: A Case Study of African Apes | url = http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/primate-speciation-a-case-study-of-african-96682434 | journal = Nature Education Knowledge | date = 2013 | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | page = 1 | series = SciTable | publisher = Nature Publishing Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins of new genes===
[[File:Evolution fate duplicate genes - vector.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Evolutionary fate of duplicate genes.]]
The most common source of new genes in eukaryotic lineages is [[gene duplication]], which creates [[copy number variation]] of an existing gene in the genome.&lt;ref name="guerzoni"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guerzoni D, McLysaght A | title = De novo origins of human genes | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = e1002381 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22102832 | pmc = 3213182 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002381 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reams AB, Roth JR | title = Mechanisms of gene duplication and amplification | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = a016592 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25646380 | pmc = 4315931 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a016592 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting genes (paralogs) may then diverge in sequence and in function. Sets of genes formed in this way compose a [[gene family]]. Gene duplications and losses within a family are common and represent a major source of evolutionary [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Demuth JP, De Bie T, Stajich JE, Cristianini N, Hahn MW | title = The evolution of mammalian gene families | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = e85 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17183716 | pmc = 1762380 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000085 | bibcode = 2006PLoSO...1...85D }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, gene duplication may result in a nonfunctional copy of a gene, or a functional copy may be subject to mutations that result in loss of function; such nonfunctional genes are called [[pseudogene]]s.&lt;ref name="MBOC" /&gt;{{rp|7.6}}

===Genetic and genomic nomenclature===
[[Gene nomenclature]] has been established by the [[HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee]] (HGNC), a committee of the [[Human Genome Organisation]], for each known human gene in the form of an approved gene name and [[symbol]] (short-form [[abbreviation]]), which can be accessed through a database maintained by HGNC. Symbols are chosen to be unique, and each gene has only one symbol (although approved symbols sometimes change). Symbols are preferably kept consistent with other members of a [[gene family]] and with homologs in other species, particularly the [[mouse]] due to its role as a common [[model organism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the HGNC|url=https://www.genenames.org/about/overview|website=HGNC Database of Human Gene Names|publisher=HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee|access-date=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
