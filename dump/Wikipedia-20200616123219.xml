'''''Jobs''''' is a 2013 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[drama film|drama]] film based on the life of [[Steve Jobs]], from 1974 while a student at [[Reed College]] to the introduction of the [[iPod]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/show_story.php?id=30653/|title=Palo Alto Online Film Review: Jobs|author=Peter Canavese |publisher=Palo Alto Online|date=August 16, 2013|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is directed by [[Joshua Michael Stern]], written by Matt Whiteley, and produced by Stern and Mark Hulme. Steve Jobs is portrayed by [[Ashton Kutcher]], with [[Josh Gad]] as [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]'s co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]]. ''Jobs'' was chosen to close the [[2013 Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="sundance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sundance.org/festival/release/2013-sundance-film-festival-announces-films-in-premieres-and-documentary-pr/ |title=2013 Sundance Film Festival Announces Films in Premieres and Documentary Premieres |work=Sundance.org |publisher=Sundance Institute |date=December 3, 2012 |accessdate=December 27, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222004405/http://www.sundance.org/festival/release/2013-sundance-film-festival-announces-films-in-premieres-and-documentary-pr/ |archivedate=December 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibbs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/28/sundance-festival-jobs-first-look-review |title=Sundance film festival 2013: Jobs – first look review |date=January 28, 2013 |last=Gibbs |first=Ed |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The film opens in 2001 with a middle-aged [[Steve Jobs]] ([[Ashton Kutcher]]) introducing the [[iPod]] at an Apple Town Hall meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://everystevejobsvideo.com/original-ipod-introduction-apple-special-event-2001/|title=Original iPod introduction – Apple Special Event (2001)|website=EverySteveJobsVideo|access-date=October 9, 2017|quote=October 2001 (Location: Apple Town Hall). Steve was 46 years old.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009092720/https://everystevejobsvideo.com/original-ipod-introduction-apple-special-event-2001/|archive-date=October 9, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story flashes back to [[Reed College]] in 1974. The high tuition forces Jobs to drop out, but Dean Jack Dudman ([[James Woods]]) allows him to sit in on classes. Jobs is particularly interested in a calligraphy course. Jobs meets up with his friend [[Daniel Kottke]] ([[Lukas Haas]]), who is excited to see Jobs with a copy of [[Be Here Now (book)|''Be Here Now'']]'' ''by [[Ram Dass|Baba Ram Dass]]. Influenced by this book and his experiences with [[History of lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], Jobs and Kottke spend time in [[Hippie trail|India]].

Two years later, Jobs is back in [[Los Altos, California]], living with his adoptive parents Paul ([[John Getz]]) and Clara ([[Lesley Ann Warren]]). While working for [[Atari]], Jobs develops a partnership with his friend [[Steve Wozniak]] ([[Josh Gad]]) after seeing that Wozniak has built a personal computer (the [[Apple I]]). They name their new company [[Apple Computer]], though there is another company called [[Apple Records]] that is owned by [[The Beatles]] (Wozniak teases Jobs that this symbolizes his preference for [[Bob Dylan]]). Wozniak demonstrates the Apple I at the [[Homebrew Computer Club]]. Jobs is later approached by [[Paul Terrell]] ([[Brad William Henke]]) who shows interest in the Apple I. Jobs persuades his father Paul to let them set up their new company in the family garage (which is a carpentry/tool center). Jobs also recruits Kottke , [[Bill Fernandez]] , ([[Victor Rasuk]]) and [[Chris Espinosa]] (Eddie Hassell) to the Apple team.&lt;ref name=slashdot/&gt;

Terrell's disappointment in the Apple I, inspires Jobs to restart with a second model. He hires [[Rod Holt]] ([[Ron Eldard]]) to re-conceptualize the power supply for what will be called the [[Apple II]]. [[Mike Markkula]] ([[Dermot Mulroney]]), a venture capitalist, notices Jobs and Wozniak's work, and also joins Apple. The Apple II is released at the 1977 [[West Coast Computer Faire]] where it is a remarkable success.

Apple's success eventually causes Jobs to distance himself from his friends. Upon learning his high-school girlfriend [[Chrisann Brennan]] ([[Ahna O'Reilly]]) is pregnant, Jobs ends their relationship. Brennan gives birth to [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs|Lisa Brennan]] whom Jobs denies is his child. [[John Sculley]] ([[Matthew Modine]]) is recruited as CEO of the company. As Jobs' behavior grows more erratic (for example firing an employee for not appreciating his investment in using fonts), Jobs is moved from [[Apple Lisa|The Lisa]] to the [[Macintosh#History|Macintosh Group]] where he works with Bill Atkinson, [[Burrell Smith]] (Lenny Jacobson), Chris Espinosa, and [[Andy Hertzfeld]] ([[Elden Henson]]). He also forces out [[Jef Raskin]], the original Macintosh group team 1 leader. Though the Macintosh is introduced with great fanfare in 1984, Scully forces Jobs out of the company in 1985.

The film jumps to 1996. Jobs is married to [[Laurene Powell Jobs]] ([[Abby Brammell]]) and he has accepted Lisa (Annika Bertea) as his daughter (she now lives with them). He has a son, Reed (Paul Baretto) and is also running [[NeXT]]. When Apple buys NeXT, then-CEO [[Gil Amelio]] asks Jobs to return to Apple as a consultant. Jobs is soon named the new CEO, and ultimately fires Amelio and also his ex-friend Markkula (who refused to support him when he was forced out of Apple 11 years prior). Jobs becomes interested in the work of [[Jony Ive]] (Giles Matthey) and strives to reinvent Apple. The film ends with Jobs recording the [[Think Different#Text|dialogue for the ''Think Different'']] commercial in 1997. Before the credits, there is a photo montage of the main characters paired with film clips of the actor playing the part, plus a dedication to Steve Jobs.

==Production==

===Development===
[[File:Jobsmovie Los Altos.JPG|thumb|Crew filming ''Jobs'' at Steve Jobs' childhood home in [[Los Altos, California]].]]
Screenwriter Matt Whiteley began work on the screenplay around the time Steve Jobs took medical leave from Apple to battle pancreatic cancer.&lt;ref name=mercurynews/&gt; Director Joshua Michael Stern stated in an interview that all material for the screenplay was collected via research and interviews:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mark Hulme, our producer, had an expert team of researchers to comb through all public records and interviews that had anything to do with Steve Jobs. Mark, the screenwriter and the research team, also took it upon themselves to interview quite a large pool of people who either worked at Apple or worked with Steve to make sure we portrayed as accurate a portrait and telling of the events possible within the constraints of the film's length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bohemianrhapsodyclub.weebly.com/uploads/7/0/0/4/7004357/jobs_production_notes.pdf|title=Q&amp;A with JOBS director, Joshua Michael Stern|date=|author=|publisher=MELBOURNE PUBLICITY|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Production began in June 2012 at Jobs' childhood home in [[Los Altos, California]], with the help of Jobs' stepmother, Marilyn Jobs (who still lives there).{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} It was also observed by his sister Patricia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2013/09/24/steve-jobs-sister-weighs-in-on-effort-to-preserve-apple-co-founders-childhood-home-in-los-altos/ |title=Steve Jobs' sister weighs in on effort to preserve Apple co-founder's childhood home in Los Altos |publisher=Contracostatimes.com |date=June 11, 2012 |accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the film was shot in the [[Los Angeles]] region.&lt;ref name=mercurynews&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/entertainment/ci_23832367/ashton-kutcher-steve-jobs-and-making-jobs |title=Ashton Kutcher, Steve Jobs and the making of 'Jobs' |newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]] |date=August 12, 2013 |first=Charlie |last=McCollum |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=locations&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2357129/locations?ref_=tt_ql_dt_6|title=Jobs (2013)|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Russell Carpenter]] was the cinematographer.&lt;ref name=mirror/&gt;

In August 2012, production moved to [[New Delhi]] and [[Vrindavan]] in order to provide the setting for Jobs' [[Hippie trail|1974 trek to India]]. Locations include "Delhi's [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]], the [[Hauz Khas Complex]], [[Tomb of Safdarjung|Safdarjung Tomb]] and [[Humayun's Tomb]]."&lt;ref name=locations/&gt;&lt;ref name="indiaproduction"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.indiawest.com/news/12857-steve-jobs-indian-journey-depicted-in-jobs-biopic.html |title=Steve Jobs' Indian Journey Depicted in 'Jobs' Biopic |newspaper=India-West |date=August 14, 2013 |first=Lisa |last=Tsering |accessdate=August 15, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818042119/http://www.indiawest.com/news/12857-steve-jobs-indian-journey-depicted-in-jobs-biopic.html |archivedate=August 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aseem Bajaj (''[[Bandit Queen]]'', ''[[Chameli (film)|Chameli]]'', and ''[[Khoya Khoya Chand]]'') served as cinematographer for scenes shot in India, though cinematographer Russell Carpenter went to India as well. Bajaj notes that they "shot guerrilla style in the crazy and mad by-lanes of [[Chandni Chowk]] in Old Delhi. We shot near the [[Red Fort]] and the famous Jama Masjid for two full days with multiple cameras spread across everywhere. Ashton stood frozen with the chaos staring right in his face which helped us capture what Steve Jobs must have felt on his visit to India."&lt;ref name=mirror&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/entertainment/bollywood/Shooting-a-frozen-Jobs/articleshow/21816630.cms |title=Shooting a 'frozen' Jobs |newspaper=[[Mumbai Mirror]] |date=August 14, 2013 |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/more/news/view/id/2036795 |title=Bollywood cinematographer shot Steve Jobs bio-pic |date=August 15, 2013 |author=Subhash K.

==Release==
The ''Business Insider'' described the film's opening as a [[box office flop]], earning $6.7 million in its first weekend and placing seventh overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ashton-kutchers-steve-jobs-movie-bombed-2013-8 |title=Ashton Kutcher's Steve Jobs Movie Bombed |publisher=Business Insider |date=August 19, 2013 |accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It had a worldwide gross of $35.9 million against its $12 million budget,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jobs.htm |title=Jobs |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the film a modest box office success.

==Reception==
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a 28% rating, based on 133 reviews, with a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 4.95/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "An ambitious but skin-deep portrait of an influential, complex figure, ''Jobs'' often has the feel of an over-sentimentalized made-for-TV biopic."&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jobs (2013)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jobs_2013/|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Review aggregator [[Metacritic]] gave the film a score of 44 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/jobs|title=Jobs Reviews|accessdate=June 26, 2013|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average rating of "B-".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemascore.com/|title=Home|website=Cinemascore|language=en-US|access-date=March 6, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[E! Online]]'' said, "Critics have taken the film to task for a reach that falls far short of its ambition, marred by its superficial and unsatisfying portrait of an icon who deserved better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Loinaz|first=Alexis L.|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/449465/jobs-reviews-are-in-ashton-kutcher-s-steve-jobs-homage-not-quite-the-apple-of-critics-eyes|title=''Jobs'' Reviews Are In: Ashton Kutcher's Steve Jobs Homage Not Quite the Apple of Critics' Eyes|date=August 16, 2013|work=[[E! Online]]|publisher=[[E!]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' reported that the consensus among critics was "mixed positives for Kutcher's performance" and a "thumbs down for Joshua Michael Stern's film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Elmer-DeWitt|first=Philip|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/08/16/apple-jobs-kutcher-reviews/|title=Ashton Kutcher's ''Jobs'': What the critics are saying|date=August 16, 2013|work=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert X. Cringely]], author of ''[[Accidental Empires]]'' and creator of the documentaries ''[[Triumph of the Nerds]]'' and ''[[Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview]]'', argues that "the film is beautifully shot and Kutcher's portrayal of Jobs, while not spot-on, is pretty darned good. He certainly has the look down and the walk. But Ashton Kutcher also produced this film and he's definitely a better actor than producer. There are a lot of historical inaccuracies that just don't have to be there. ... The great failing of this film is the same failing as with [[Steve Jobs (book)|Walter Isaacson's book]]: something happened during Steve's [[NeXT]] years (which occupy less than 60 seconds of this 122 minute film) that turned Jobs from a brat into a leader, but they don't bother to cover that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cringely.com/2013/08/19/ashton-kutchers-steve-jobs-somehow-misses-the-whole-point/|title=Ashton Kutcher's Steve Jobs somehow misses the whole point|date=August 19, 2013|website=cringely.com|last=Cringely|first=Robert X.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' states that "at its best, it's a good picture, and at its worst, it's almost good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Jobs-review-Kutcher-s-fine-but-film-s-timing-4735382.php|title=''Jobs'' review: Kutcher's fine, but film's timing is off|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|first=Mick|last=LaSalle|date=August 15, 2013|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' suggests that "Kutcher nails the genius and narcissism. It's a quietly dazzling performance" but also notes that "''Jobs'' is a one-man show that needed to go for broke and doesn't. My guess is that Jobs would give it a swat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/jobs-20130815|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|title=''Jobs''|first=Peter|last=Travers|date=August 15, 2013|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contributor for [[Roger Ebert|rogerebert.com]], Susan Wloszczyna, gave the movie 2/4 stars, saying that, "Rather than attempting a deeper plunge behind the whys and wherefores of the elite business-model gospel according to [[Apple Inc.]] guru Steve Jobs and – more importantly – what it says about our culture, the filmmakers follow the easy rise-fall-rise-again blueprint familiar to anyone who has seen an episode of VH1's ''Behind the Music''."&lt;ref name=RogerE&gt;{{cite web|last=Wloszczyna|first=Susan|title=Jobs|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/jobs-2013|publisher=RogerEbert.com|accessdate=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She further discusses how Kutcher's performance and the overall movie failed to portray Jobs in the iconic manner that current pop culture suggests even after Jobs' passing. In a movie review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', writer [[Manohla Dargis]] writes that ''Jobs'' was "inevitably unsatisfying"&lt;ref name="New York Times Movie Review"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|title=Portrait of the Artist Behind Apple Ashton Kutcher in a Biopic About Steve Jobs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/movies/ashton-kutcher-in-a-biopic-about-steve-jobs.html|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a result of a poor performance of the filmmakers rather than the actors themselves.

==Historical accuracy==
In a January 2013 interview with ''[[The Verge]]'', [[Steve Wozniak]] notes that he was approached by the crew of ''Jobs'' and given an early script to read. He read it as far as he "could stomach it and felt it was crap. [[Steve Jobs (film)|The Sony people]] got in contact with me too and in the end I went with them. You can't do both [films] and be paid."&lt;ref name=vergejan/&gt; At around the same time, he responded to the first promotional clip for the film on ''[[Gizmodo]]'' by stating that the "personalities are very wrong, although mine is closer ... our relationship was so different than what was portrayed."&lt;ref name="vergejan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Ross|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/26/3919472/steve-wozniak-turned-down-offer-to-work-on-jobs-after-reading-early-script/in/2794100|title=Steve Wozniak turned down offer to work on ''Jobs'' after reading early script: 'I felt it was crap'|work=[[The Verge]]|date=January 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, before the wide release of the film, Kutcher responded to these critiques in a few interviews. In an interview with the [[Associated Press]], Kutcher stated: {{cquote|Steve Wozniak is being paid by another company to support their Steve Jobs film. It's personal for him, but it's also business. We have to keep that in mind. He was also extremely unavailable to us when producing this film.

I can't take that creative leadership from someone else. And I was turned off by the ''Jobs'' script. But I still hoped for a great movie." He also believed several individuals portrayed in the film were inaccurately and/or unfairly portrayed including himself and Steve Jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wozniak|first=Steve|url=https://gizmodo.com/jobs-reviewed-by-steve-wozniak-1153771108|title=''Jobs'', Reviewed by Steve Wozniak|publisher=[[Gizmodo]]|date=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wozniak reiterated these points in an interview with [[Bloomberg Television]] adding that he is "really easy to get a hold of, [Kutcher] could have called me and consulted over the phone any time."&lt;ref name=vergaug17/&gt; ''The Verge'' noted that "Wozniak was in fact invited to consult on the film, but declined after reading the script, saying he and his wife were 'abhorred' by it. Wozniak was a consultant on [[Aaron Sorkin]]'s [[Steve Jobs (film)|2015 ''Steve Jobs'' film]]. When asked why he did not at least correct the inaccuracies he saw, Wozniak said, 'I have a very busy life, and it came at a very busy time in my life.'"&lt;ref name="vergaug17"&gt;{{cite news|last=Toor|first=Amar|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/17/4630596/steve-wozniak-on-steve-jobs-movie-ashton-kutcher|title=Steve Wozniak says 'there were a lot of things wrong' with ''Jobs'' movie|work=[[The Verge]]|date=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Slashdot]]'', [[Daniel Kottke]] states that he consulted on early versions of the screenplay and notes that "Ashton's very good. I have no complaints with him at all, no complaints with his portrayal of Jobs. The complaint that people would rightly have about the film is that it portrays Woz as not having the same vision as Steve Jobs, which is really unfair." He also said that the early versions of the screenplay "were painful. Really painful. I forwarded the first draft to [[Mike Markkula]] because they wanted his feedback, and Mike took such a bad reaction to it, he wouldn't have anything more to do with the project. By the time it got to the fourth draft, it was okay. It wasn't making me cringe."&lt;ref name=slashdot/&gt; Kottke also outlines various areas that were both accurate and inaccurate in the film. [[Bill Fernandez]] was part of the same interview but states that he didn't see the film because "the whole thing is a work of fiction, and I don't want to be upset by all the things that the screenwriter has invented and don't represent the truth." Kottke responded that he didn't think of the film as fiction because "I was involved early on in the film, and they really, sincerely tried to make it as accurate as they could."&lt;ref name="slashdot"&gt;{{cite news|last=Assar|first=Vijith|url=http://insights.dice.com/2013/08/16/early-apple-employees-talk-memories-of-steve-jobs-new-movie-2/|title='Early Apple Employees Talk Memories of Steve Jobs, New Movie| work=[[Slashdot]]|date=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same interview, Fernandez and Kottke commented on the characterization of [[Rod Holt]] (portrayed by actor [[Ron Eldard]]). Kottke disputed the characterization, noting that: "What completely cracked us all up is the scene where Rod arrives for the first time. Rod comes up wearing leathers, riding up on a motorcycle with long hair ... he's like this motorcycle dude. It just cracked us all up."&lt;ref name=slashdot/&gt; Fernandez, who had not seen the film at the time of the interview, was also surprised by this portrayal. Holt, however, (according to Kottke), "thought it was hilarious."&lt;ref name=slashdot/&gt; As for why he may have been characterized this way, Kottke states that, "Rod was really into dirt bikes. And I never saw him riding one, but he talked about it all the time. So the author just had him riding up on a motorcycle. I liked that guy. I met him on the set. I had no idea who he was when I met him because he doesn't look at all like Rod, he has long straight hair and he's wearing leathers."&lt;ref name=slashdot/&gt; Fernandez, who was equally amused by this vision of Holt responded by asking, "Who could this possibly be in the Apple universe? ... It seems to me that there's a lot of [[fan fiction]] about Apple Computer and about Steve Jobs, and I think that this is the biggest, flashiest piece of fan fiction that there's been to date.
&lt;ref name=slashdot/&gt;

[[Chris Espinosa]] stated on Twitter, "FYI My position at Apple precludes my commenting on the #JobsMovie with the press or public. But I can say that I enjoyed watching the film."&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/cdespinosa/status/368618820409126914 Chris Espinosa@Twitter]. August 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The TV show ''[[John Wants Answers]]'' took Wozniak, Kottke, and [[Andy Hertzfeld]] through the film scene by scene and discussed how the events actually occurred.&lt;ref name="johnwants"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vink|first=John|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gICwMQQ48Dk|title=The Cast of ''Jobs''|work=[[John Wants Answers]]|publisher=KMVT 15|date=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
