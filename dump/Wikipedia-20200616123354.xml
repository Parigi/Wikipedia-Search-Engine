==Early life and education==
Cook was born in [[Mobile, Alabama]], United States.&lt;ref name="AL.com-Robertsdale"&gt;Michael Finch II: [http://blog.al.com/live/2014/02/tim_cook_--_apple_ceo_and_robe.html ''Tim Cook – Apple CEO and Robertsdale's favorite son – still finds time to return to his Baldwin County roots.''] AL.com, February 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/the-rise-of-apple-ceo-tim-cook-2016-1 |title=The rise of Apple CEO Tim Cook, the leader of the first $1 trillion company in the US |last=Weinberger |first=Matt |website=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was baptized in a [[Baptist]] church&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/pro-discrimination-religious-freedom-laws-are-dangerous-to-america/2015/03/29/bdb4ce9e-d66d-11e4-ba28-f2a685dc7f89_story.html |title=Tim Cook: Pro-discrimination 'religious freedom' laws are dangerous |last=Cook |first=Tim |date=March 29, 2016 |access-date=November 27, 2016 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in nearby [[Robertsdale, Alabama|Robertsdale]]. His father, Donald, was a [[shipyard]] worker, and his mother, Geraldine, worked at a pharmacy.&lt;ref name="AL.com-Robertsdale" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2014/02/tim_cook_--_apple_ceo_and_robe.html |title=Tim Cook – Apple CEO and Robertsdale's favorite son – still finds time to return to his Baldwin County roots |website=AL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook graduated from [[Robertsdale High School]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Why Tim Cook’s old high school is no longer giving students Apple MacBooks|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/03/08/why-tim-cooks-old-high-school-is-no-longer-giving-students-apple-macbooks/|last=Frankel|first=Todd|date=March 8, 2016|website=The Washington Post|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=May 7, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.S.) in [[industrial engineering]] from [[Auburn University]] in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2011/08/portrait-of-new-apple-ceo-tim-cook-as-a-young-auburn-student/#.VEGJW-fOSDo Portrait of New Apple CEO Tim Cook as a Young Auburn Student]: The War Eagle Reader&lt;/ref&gt; and his [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) from [[Duke University]]'s [[Fuqua School of Business]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="dukenews"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2009/01/15/fuqua-grad-takes-reins-apple |title=Fuqua grad takes reins at Apple |last=Love |first=Julia |date=January 14, 2009 |work=[[The Chronicle (Duke University)]] |access-date=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Pre-Apple era===
After graduating from Auburn University, Cook spent 12 years in [[IBM]]'s personal computer business, ultimately serving as the director of North American fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tim Cook {{!}} American business executive|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tim-Cook|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time that Cook also earned his MBA from [[Duke University]], becoming a Fuqua Scholar in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Apple CEO to deliver 2018 Duke commencement address|url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article195793864.html|last=|first=|date=January 20, 2018|website=The News and Observer|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=May 7, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he served as the [[chief operating officer|Chief Operating Officer]] of the computer reseller division of Intelligent Electronics. In 1997, he became the Vice President for Corporate Materials at [[Compaq]] for six months, but left the position after being hired by Steve Jobs.&lt;ref name="CNN Money"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2011/08/24/technology/cook_apple.fortune/index3.htm?iid=EL |title=The genius of Steve |date=August 24, 2011 |work=CNN |access-date=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apple era===
====Early career====
In 1998, [[Steve Jobs]] asked Cook to join Apple. In a [[commencement speech]] at [[Auburn University]], Cook said he decided to join Apple after meeting Jobs for the first time:

{{quote|Any purely rational consideration of cost and benefits lined up in Compaq's favor, and the people who knew me best advised me to stay at Compaq... On that day in early 1998, I listened to my intuition, not the left side of my brain or for that matter even the people who knew me best... no more than five minutes into my initial interview with Steve, I wanted to throw caution and logic to the wind and join Apple. My intuition already knew that joining Apple was a once in a lifetime opportunity to work for the creative genius and to be on the executive team that could resurrect a great American company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1776338/tim-cook-apple-ceo-auburn-university-commencement-speech-2010 |title=Commencement Address at Auburn University, 20110 |last=Cook |first=Tim |publisher=Fast Co Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

His first position was [[vice president|Senior Vice President]] for worldwide operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Apple CEO Tim Cook had an impact on the company before he was even hired|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-influenced-apple-and-steve-jobs-before-he-was-even-hired-2019-4|last=Eadicicco|first=Lisa|website=Business Insider|access-date=2020-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook closed factories and warehouses, and replaced them with contract manufacturers; this resulted in a reduction of the company's inventory from months to days. Predicting its importance, his group had invested in long-term deals such as advance investment in [[flash memory]] since 2005. This guaranteed a stable supply of what became the [[iPod Nano]], then [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} Competitors at [[Hewlett-Packard]] described their canceled [[HP TouchPad]] tablet computer and later said that it was made from "cast-off, reject iPad parts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Pre to postmortem: the inside story of the death of Palm and webOS|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/5/3062611/palm-webos-hp-inside-story-pre-postmortem|last=Ziegler|first=Chris|website=The Verge|access-date=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook's actions were recognized for keeping costs under control and, combined with the rest of the company, generated huge profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lashinsky|first=Adam|date=November 10, 2008|title=The genius behind Steve|work=CNN|url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/11/09/technology/cook_apple.fortune/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tim Cook WWDC 2012.jpg|thumb|Cook giving the [[keynote]] at the [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|2012 World Wide Developers Conference]].]]
In January 2007, Cook was promoted to lead operations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/24/technology/24cook.html?pagewanted=all |title=The Understudy Takes the Stage at Apple |last=Helft |first=Miguel |date=January 23, 2011 |work=The New York Times |access-date=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as chief executive in 2009, while Jobs was away on a leave of absence for health related issues. In January 2011, Apple's board of directors approved a third medical leave of absence requested by Jobs. During that time, Cook was responsible for most of Apple's day-to-day operations, while Jobs made most major decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12205173 |title=Apple boss Steve Jobs takes 'medical leave' |date=January 17, 2011 |work=BBC News |access-date=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rob"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robinferracone/2011/09/13/an-outsiders-view-of-apples-succession-plan-3/ |title=An Outsider's View of Apple's Succession Plan |last=Robin Ferracone |date=September 13, 2011 |website=Forbes.com |publisher=Forbes LLC |access-date=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apple chief executive (2011–present)====
After Jobs resigned as CEO and became chairman of the board, Cook was named the new chief executive officer of Apple Inc. on August 24, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/24/us-apple-idUSTRE77N82K20110824 |title=Steve Jobs resigns from Apple, Cook becomes CEO |date=August 24, 2011 |access-date=August 24, 2011 |agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116096027141893457 |title=Apple's no. 2 has low profile, high impact |last=Wingfield |first=Nick |date=October 16, 2006 |work=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=October 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six weeks later, on October 5, 2011, Jobs died due to complications from [[pancreatic cancer]].&lt;ref name="gizmododaybeforehedied"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://gizmodo.com/5851475/steve-jobs-worked-the-day-before-he-died |title=Steve Jobs Worked the Day Before He Died |last=Biddle, Sam |date=October 19, 2011 |website=Gizmodo |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68egBhxkQ?url=http://gizmodo.com/5851475/steve-jobs-worked-the-day-before-he-died |archive-date=June 24, 2012 |access-date=October 21, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Forbes'' contributor Robin Ferracone wrote in September 2011: "Jobs and Cook proceeded to forge a strong partnership, and rescued the company from its death spiral, which took it from $11 billion in revenue in 1995 down to less than $6 billion in 1998 ... Under their leadership, the company went from its nadir to a remarkable $100 billion today".&lt;ref name="Rob" /&gt;{{Better source|reason=Forbes contributors do not have editorial oversight.|date=January 2018}} In April 2012, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' included Cook on its annual "100 Most Influential People in the World" list.&lt;ref name="Time2012"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2111975_2111976_2112101,00.html |title=The 100 Most Influential People in the World |last=Gore |first=Al |authorlink=Al Gore |date=April 12, 2012 |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102101130/http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2111975_2111976_2112101,00.html |archive-date=January 2, 2019 |access-date=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 29, 2012, Cook made major changes to the company's executive team. [[Scott Forstall]] resigned as senior vice president of [[iOS]], and became an advisor to Cook until he eventually departed from the company in 2013. [[John Browett]], who was Senior VP of retail, was dismissed six months after he commenced at Apple, when he received 100,000 shares worth US$60 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cultofmac.com/163180/apple-welcomes-new-retail-vp-john-browett-with-60-million-in-stock/ |title=Apple Welcomes New Retail VP John Browett With $60 Million In Stock |last=Heath |first=Alex |date=April 25, 2012 |website=Cult Of Mac |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513141746/http://www.cultofmac.com/163180/apple-welcomes-new-retail-vp-john-browett-with-60-million-in-stock/ |archive-date=May 13, 2013 |access-date=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forstall's duties were divided among four other Apple executives: design SVP [[Sir Jonathan Ive]] assumed leadership of Apple's human interface team; [[Craig Federighi]] became the new head of iOS software engineering; services chief [[Eddy Cue]] became responsible for Maps and Siri; and [[Bob Mansfield]], previously SVP of hardware engineering, became the head of a new technology group.&lt;ref name="applepr"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/10/29Apple-Announces-Changes-to-Increase-Collaboration-Across-Hardware-Software-Services.html |title=Apple Announces Changes to Increase Collaboration Across Hardware, Software &amp; Services |date=October 29, 2012 |publisher=Apple Inc. |access-date=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook's executive changes occurred after the third quarter of the [[fiscal year]], when revenues and profits grew less than predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/30/apple-tim-cook-ruthless-streak |title=Apple's Tim Cook shows ruthless streak in firing maps and retail executives |last=Arthur |first=Charles |date=October 30, 2012 |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; One commentator said that Forstall was forced to step down, as Cook "decided to lance the boil as internal politics and dissent reached a key pitch". Since becoming CEO, Cook focused upon building a harmonious culture that meant "weeding out people with disagreeable personalities—people Jobs tolerated and even held close, like Forstall";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikamorphy/2012/10/30/this-is-tim-cooks-apple-a-company-where-mini-steve-gets-the-axe |title=This is Tim Cook's Apple: A Company Where 'Mini-Steve' Gets the Axe |last=Morphy |first=Erika |date=October 30, 2012 |work=Forbes |access-date=May 2, 2013}}{{Better source|reason=Forbes contributors do not have editorial oversight.|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; although, another journalist said that "Apple's ability to innovate came from tension and disagreement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ex-employee-why-firing-scott-forstall-was-a-mistake-2012-11 |title=Fired Apple Executive Scott Forstall 'Was The Best Approximation Of Steve Jobs That Apple Had Left' |last=Jay Yarow |date=November 12, 2012 |work=Business Insider |access-date=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 28, 2014, Cook made headlines when he challenged shareholders to "get out of the stock" if they didn't share the company's views on sustainability and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2014/03/01/apple-cook-shareholders-sustainability/ |title=Apple's Tim Cook picks a fight with climate change deniers |date=March 1, 2014 |work=CNN |access-date=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, Cook traveled to [[China]] to meet with government officials there after the closure of Apple's online iTunes Store and Apple Books store by the Chinese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/6/11606412/apple-china-books-movies-tim-cook-visit |title=Tim Cook reportedly traveling to China following closure of Apple's online stores |last=Vincent |first=James |date=May 6, 2016 |website=The Verge |access-date=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, some analysts compared Cook to former [[Microsoft]] CEO [[Steve Ballmer]], claiming that innovation had died down since he replaced Jobs, similar to when Ballmer became Microsoft CEO in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/10/25/why-tim-cook-is-steve-ballmer/ |title=Why Tim Cook is Steve Ballmer |date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cio.com/article/3170935/leadership-management/apple-is-tim-cook-turning-into-steve-ballmer.html |title=Apple: Is Tim Cook turning into Steve Ballmer? |last=Lynch |first=Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, Cook was a speaker at the [[World Internet Conference]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/4/16733202/china-apple-google-tim-cook-sundar-pichai-open-internet-surprise-guests |title=Apple's Tim Cook and Google's Sundar Pichai were surprise guests at China's internet conference |last=Liao |first=Shannon |date=2017-12-04 |website=The Verge |access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://qz.com/1145637/2017-world-internet-conference-tim-cook-and-sundar-pichais-surprise-remarks/ |title=Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai's surprise remarks at China's "open internet" conference |last=Horwitz |first=Josh |date=2017-12-04 |website=QZ |access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published at the [[University of Oxford]] characterized Cook's leadership style as paradigmatic of founder centrism: explained as a founder's mindset, an ethical disposition towards the shareholder collective, and an intense focus on exponential value creation.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/business-law-blog/blog/2017/06/eclipse-public-corporation-revisited-concentrated-equity-ownership |title=Eclipse of the Public Corporation Revisited: Concentrated Equity Ownership Theory |last=Rojas |first=Claudio |publisher=The University of Oxford |access-date=June 27, 2017}} ("Founder centrism, an inclusive concept within Concentrated Equity Ownership (CEO) theory, integrates the capacity of both founder and non-founder senior leadership to adopt an owner's mindset in traditionally structured corporations, such as Thomas J. Watson Sr. and Thomas Watson Jr. with IBM, Steve Jobs and Tim Cook with Apple, Jamie Dimon with JPMorgan Chase, Lloyd Blankfein with Goldman Sachs... and many others. In substance, all fall within the ambit of founder centrism".)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook was appointed chairman of the advisory board for [[Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management|Tsinghua University's economics school]] in October 2019. The length of his term will be 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-ceo-tim-cook-to-be-chinese-business-school-chairman-2019-10|title=Apple CEO Tim Cook took a chairman position at one of China's top business schools|last=Wood|first=Charlie|website=Business Insider|access-date=2019-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside [[Google]] vice-president [[Vint Cerf]] and [[AT&amp;T]] CEO [[Randall Stephenson]], Cook attended a summit held by [[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]], on August 8, 2013, in regard to government surveillance and the [[Internet]] in the wake of the [[Edward Snowden]] [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures|NSA incident]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/09/nsa-surveillance-apple-google-obama |title=Apple, Google and AT&amp;T meet Obama to discuss NSA surveillance concerns |last=Garside |first=Juliette |date=August 9, 2013 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/08/tim-cook-barack-obama-technology-95362.html |title=Apple's Tim Cook, tech executives meet with Barack Obama to talk surveillance |last=Romm |first=Tony |date=August 8, 2013 |website=[[Politico]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190203173224/https://www.politico.com/story/2013/08/tim-cook-barack-obama-technology-095362 |archive-date=February 3, 2019 |access-date=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2015 San Bernardino attack|December 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino]], California, in which 14 people were killed by [[Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] solicited Apple to assist in "unlock[ing]" an iPhone 5C used by Farook.&lt;ref name="NYT FBI"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/technology/apple-timothy-cook-fbi-san-bernardino.html |title=Apple Fights Order to Unlock San Bernardino Gunman's iPhone |last=Lichtblau |first=Eric |date=February 17, 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=February 21, 2016 |last2=Benner |first2=Katie |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 16, 2016, in response to a request by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], a federal magistrate judge ordered Apple to create a custom iOS [[firmware]] version that would allow investigators to circumvent the phone's security features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/02/judge-apple-must-help-fbi-unlock-san-bernardino-shooters-iphone/ |title=Judge: Apple must help FBI unlock San Bernardino shooter's iPhone |last=Farivar |first=Cyrus |date=February 16, 2016 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217094935/http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/02/judge-apple-must-help-fbi-unlock-san-bernardino-shooters-iphone/ |archive-date=February 17, 2016 |access-date=February 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook responded in an open letter, wherein he denounced the government's demands as constituting a "breach of privacy" with "chilling" consequences.&lt;ref name="NYT FBI" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/customer-letter/ |title=A Message to Our Customers |last=Cook |first=Tim |authorlink=Tim Cook |date=February 16, 2016 |publisher=Apple Inc. |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217084120/http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/ |archive-date=February 17, 2016 |access-date=February 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Cook said he donated to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] senators [[Chuck Schumer]] and [[Patrick Leahy]] for their stances on [[E-book|eBook]] pricing and surveillance reform, respectively.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the same election cycle he hosted a fundraiser for Senator [[Rob Portman]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/tim-cook-apple-paul-ryan-fundraiser-224554 |title=Apple's Cook to host Paul Ryan fundraiser amid Trump woes |last=Romm |first=Tony |date=June 20, 2016 |website=[[Politico]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621000037/https://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/tim-cook-apple-paul-ryan-fundraiser-224554 |archive-date=June 21, 2016 |access-date=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early March 2016, he said he donated to the election campaign of Democratic representative [[Zoe Lofgren]] of California. In early June, Cook hosted a private fundraiser along with Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives [[Paul Ryan]], described by ''[[Politico]]'' as "a joint fundraising committee aimed at helping to elect other House [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]], Cook raised funds for the [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]] of [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2016/08/24/apple-tim-cook-fundraiser-clinton/ |title=Apple CEO Tim Cook Is Hosting a Fundraiser for Hillary Clinton |last=Pressman |first=Aaron |date=Aug 24, 2016 |website=www.fortune.com |publisher=Fortune |access-date=September 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, Clinton's campaign [[Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection, 2016|considered Cook as a candidate for vice-president]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/wikileaks-email-shows-apple-ceo-tim-cook-on-vp-shortlist-2016-10 |title=Hillary Clinton's campaign considered Apple CEO Tim Cook for vice president |last=Leswing |first=Kif |date=October 18, 2016 |website=[[Business Insider]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025045429/https://www.businessinsider.com/wikileaks-email-shows-apple-ceo-tim-cook-on-vp-shortlist-2016-10 |archive-date=October 25, 2016 |access-date=September 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017 at [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'s Global Business Forum, Cook defended the [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals|DACA immigration program]]. He expressed his dissatisfaction with the direction of [[Donald Trump]]'s administration, stating: "This is unacceptable. This is not who we are as a country. I am personally shocked that there is even a discussion of this."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/20/apple-ceo-tim-cooks-views-on-immigration-and-daca.html |title=CEO Tim Cook says Apple is pushing extremely hard on DACA: 'I am personally shocked that there is even a discussion of this' |website=CNBC |access-date=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.recode.net/2017/9/20/16338626/tim-cook-bloomberg-forum-dreamers-immigration |title=Tim Cook says DACA is the 'biggest issue of our time' |website=Recode |access-date=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, at a privacy conference in Brussels, Cook expressed his opinions on the stockpiling of personal data by tech firms, suggesting that it amounted to surveillance and should make the public "very uncomfortable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-ceo-tim-cook-attacks-tech-firms-that-hoard-data-2018-10 |title=Tim Cook mounted his most stinging attack yet on companies like Facebook and Google that hoard 'industrial' quantities of data |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Cook is a [[physical fitness|fitness]] enthusiast and enjoys hiking, cycling, and going to the gym. He is known for being solitary, using an off-campus fitness center for privacy, and little is publicly shared about his personal life. He explained in October 2014 that he has sought to achieve a "basic level of privacy".&lt;ref name="cnnnov2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dig"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://mobilitydigest.com/tim-cook-coming-into-his-own/ |title=Tim Cook Coming Into His Own |last=Walter Smyth |date=March 2, 2014 |website=Mobility Digest |publisher=Mobility Digest |access-date=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cook was misdiagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]] in 1996, an incident he said made him "see the world in a different way". He has since taken part in charity fundraising, such as cycle races to raise money for the disease. He later told the [[Auburn University|Auburn]] alumni magazine that his symptoms came from "lugging a lot of incredibly heavy luggage around".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304610404579405420617578250 |title=The Job After Steve Jobs: Tim Cook and Apple |last=Kane |first=Yukari |website=Wall Street Journal |access-date=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Cook said that he offered a portion of his [[liver]] to Jobs since they share a rare blood type. Cook said that Jobs responded by yelling, "I'll never let you do that. I'll never do that."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/03/13/tim_cook_tried_to_foist_his_liver_on_steve_jobs/ I BEG YOU, mighty Jobs, TAKE MY LIVER, Cook told Apple's dying co-founder]. [[The Register]]. 13 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

While delivering the 2010 [[commencement speech]] at Auburn, Cook emphasized the importance of [[Intuition (philosophy)|intuition]] during significant decision-making processes, and explained that preparation and hard work are also necessary to execute on intuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEAXuHvzjao |title=Auburn University Spring 2010 Commencement Speaker Tim Cook |date=May 14, 2010 |publisher=Auburn University |access-date=August 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 30, 2014, Cook [[came out as gay]] in an editorial for [[Bloomberg Businessweek|''Bloomberg Business'']] saying "I'm proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me."&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/tosv2.html?vid=&amp;uuid=d67b6350-3b6f-11e9-ab0f-e53e20f14f07&amp;url=L25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAxNC0xMC0zMC90aW0tY29vay1zcGVha3MtdXA= |title=Bloomberg – Are you a robot? |website=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He consulted with [[Anderson Cooper]], who had publicly come out himself, on aspects of the statement, and cleared the timing to ensure it would not distract from business interests.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://peopleenespanol.com/chica/tim-cook-the-power-of-diversity/|title=Tim Cook: The Power of Diversity|last=Correa|first=Armando|date=October 24, 2019|website=[[People en Español]]|language=EN|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook had been open about his sexuality "for years" and, while many people at the company were aware of his sexual orientation, he sought to focus on Apple's products and customers rather than his personal life. He ended his [[op-ed]] writing "We pave the sunlit path toward justice together, brick by brick. This is my brick."&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com" /&gt; Cook became the first and only [[openly]] gay CEO on the [[Fortune 500]] list.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In September 2015, Cook clarified on ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]],'' "Where I valued my privacy significantly, I felt that I was valuing it too far above what I could do for other people, so I wanted to tell everyone my truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Apple CEO tells Colbert why he came out as gay |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAWUitFgOIM |language=en |access-date=2019-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2019, he talked about the decision and remarked on how it was thanks to [[LGBTQ]] people who had fought for [[LGBT rights in the United States|their rights]] before him that paved the way for his success; and that he needed to let younger generations know that—in a coding analogy—he saw being gay as a feature his life had to offer rather than any problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He hoped his openness could help [[Homelessness among LGBT youth in the United States|LGBTQ youth dealing with homelessness]], and [[Suicide among LGBT youth|suicide]] hope that their situation could get better.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
