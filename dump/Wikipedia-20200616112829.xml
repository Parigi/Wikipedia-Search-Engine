As of 2018, the service had an estimated 850 million users, up from 782 million users in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/11/apple-could-sell-icloud-for-the-enterprise-barclays-says.html|title=The case for Apple to sell a version of iCloud for work|last=Novet|first=Jordan|date=Feb 11, 2018|publisher=[[CNBC]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple Music passes 11M subscribers as iCloud hits 782M users|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/02/12/apple-music-passes-11m-subscribers-as-icloud-hits-782m-users|date=February 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'"They Might Be Giants" With A Spanish Accent', With Special Guests Eddy Cue And Craig Federighi, The talk show 146 (32:57) [https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2016/02/12/ep-146] 12 February 2016
&lt;/ref&gt;

iCloud enables users to store data such as documents, photos, and music on remote [[server (computing)|servers]] for download to [[iOS]], [[macOS]] or [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] devices, to share and send data to other users, and to manage their Apple devices if lost or stolen.

iCloud also provides the means to wirelessly back up iOS devices directly to iCloud, instead of being reliant on manual backups to a host Mac or Windows computer using [[iTunes]]. Service users are also able to share photos, music, and games instantly by linking accounts via [[AirDrop]] wireless.

iCloud replaced Apple's [[MobileMe]] service,&lt;ref name=fromto/&gt; acting as a data syncing center for email, contacts, calendars, bookmarks, notes, reminders (to-do lists), iWork documents, photos, and other data.

Apple has eleven company owned and operated [[data centers]] supporting iCloud services. The company has six data centers in the [[United States]], two in [[Denmark]], and three in [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://baxtel.com/data-centers/apple|title=Apple Data Center Locations|last=|first=|date=|website=Baxtel.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Apple's original iCloud data centers is located in [[Maiden, North Carolina|Maiden]], [[North Carolina]], US.&lt;ref name="reg DC 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/06/09/apple_maiden_data_center|title=Apple Maiden data center|website=[[The Register]]|date=June 9, 2011|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2011, iCloud is based on [[Amazon Web Services]] and [[Microsoft Azure]] (Apple iOS Security white paper published in 2014, Apple acknowledged that encrypted iOS files are stored in [[Amazon S3]] and [[Microsoft Azure]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://images.apple.com/iphone/business/docs/iOS_Security_Feb14.pdf|title=February 2014 iOS Security white paper (PDF)|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In 2016, Apple signed a deal with [[Google]] to use [[Google Cloud Platform]] for some iCloud services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/16/apple-icloud-google-cloud-platform/|title=Apple Inks Deal to Use Google Cloud Platform for Some iCloud Services|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crn.com/news/cloud/300080062/cloud-makes-for-strange-bedfellows-apple-signs-on-with-google-cuts-spending-with-aws.htm|title=Cloud Makes For Strange Bedfellows: Apple Signs On With Google, Cuts Spending With AWS|first=Kevin McLaughlin and Joseph|last=Tsidulko|date=16 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/google-nabs-apple-as-a-cloud-customer-2016-3|title=Google just scored a huge win against Amazon by landing Apple as a customer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] reported that [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] was working on project ''Pie'' which aims to improve the speed and experience of Apple's online services by being operated more directly by Apple.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-06/apple-is-said-to-plan-improved-cloud-services-by-unifying-teams|title=Apple Said to Plan Improved Cloud Services by Unifying Teams|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]]|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also it was reported that Apple was going to relocate all of its services employees to the [[Apple Campus]] (1 [[Infinite Loop (street)|Infinite Loop]], [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]], [[California]]),&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/apple-plans-unify-its-development-teams-under-one-roof-improve-its-cloud-services-2427712|title=Apple Sets Initiative To Improve Its Cloud Services|date=2016-10-06|newspaper=[[International Business Times]]|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; as many other employees would be moving to the [[Apple Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/apple-making-efforts-unify-cloud-183420446.html|title=Apple is making efforts to unify its cloud services into one location|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==System requirements==
iCloud account creation requires either an iOS device running [[iOS 5]] or later or a Mac running [[OS X Lion]] v10.7.5 or later,&lt;ref name="Apple sys req 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/icloud/features|title=iCloud – All your music on all your devices. (requirements: small print on page bottom)|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an [[internet access|internet connection]] and a compatible [[web browser]]. Also, certain features have their own minimum requirements of OS versions. For example, using iCloud Photo Sharing requires [[OS X Mavericks]] v10.9 or above on a Mac.&lt;ref name="Apple sys req windows 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4759|title=System requirements for iCloud|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=May 21, 2014|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devices running older versions of macOS (before Mavericks) or iOS (below 7) may be unable to sign into iCloud after the iCloud password has been changed: the only resolution for this issue is to upgrade the OS, which may be impossible on a device that does not meet the newer OS minimum requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT6424 |title=If you can't sign in to iCloud after you change your Apple ID password - Apple Support |publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=September 16, 2014|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Synchronizing with a PC requires [[Windows 7]] or later and using the iCloud Control Panel, and optionally [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]] 2007 or later or the built-in [[Windows 10]] [[Mail (Windows)|Mail]] and Calendar apps to sync Calendar, Contacts, and Reminders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/icloud-email-calendars-windows|title=How to Set Up iCloud Email and Calendars on Windows 10|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users must own an Apple device to set up iCloud for Windows.

Synchronization of bookmarks requires [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] 5.1.1 or later on macOS, and [[Internet Explorer 9]], [[Firefox]] 22 or [[Google Chrome]] 28 or later on Windows.&lt;ref name="Apple sys req windows 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1455|title=iCloud Control Panel for Windows|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=December 11, 2013|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MobileMe]] account users could move their accounts to an iCloud account, keeping the same account details.&lt;ref name="Apple sys req 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4895|title=Apple IDs and iCloud|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=October 12, 2011|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
iCloud was announced on June 6, 2011,&lt;ref name="icloud announcement"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/06/06Apple-Introduces-iCloud.html|title=Apple Introduces iCloud|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=|accessdate=January 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the 2011 [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC). Apple announced that [[MobileMe]] would be discontinued after June 30, 2012, with anyone who had an account before the unveiling of iCloud having their [[MobileMe]] service extended to that date, free of charge.&lt;ref name="MM transition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4597|title=Information about the MobileMe transition|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=|access-date=August 30, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902033228/http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4597|archive-date=September 2, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official website, www.icloud.com, went live in early August for Apple Developers. On October 12, 2011, iCloud became available to use via an iTunes update.&lt;ref name="itunes available"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/itunes/?cid=OAS-US-DOMAINS-itunes.com|title=iTunes – Everything you need to be entertained|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=|accessdate=October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; iCloud had 20&amp;nbsp;million users in less than a week after launch.&lt;ref name="20m users"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-20121323-17/big-mo-in-one-week-apple-icloud-hits-20m-users-25m-use-ios-5|title=Big mo: In one week, Apple iCloud hits 20M users; 25M use iOS 5|publisher=[[CNET]]|date=October 17, 2011|accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iCloud.com domain and registered trademark were bought from a Swedish company called Xcerion, who rebranded their service to [[CloudMe]].&lt;ref name="Xcerion sale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/apple/apple-may-have-snapped-up-icloud-com|title=Apple May Have Snapped Up iCloud.com|publisher=GigaOM|date=April 27, 2011|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="domain control"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-20068165-37.html|title=Apple gains control of iCloud domain|publisher=[[CNET]]|date=June 2, 2011|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="domain acquired"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9216301/Reports_Apple_acquires_icloud.com_domain|title=Reports: Apple acquires 'icloud.com' domain|work=[[ComputerWorld]]|date=April 29, 2011|accessdate=April 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple now controls major domains like iCloud.de, iCloud.fr and iCloud.es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://icloud.de/|title=iCloud – Apple (DE)|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A class action lawsuit by customers unhappy over the transition from [[MobileMe]] to iCloud was filed in early-May 2012.&lt;ref name="class action"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/12/05/18/class_action_suit_targets_apple_for_icloud_downtime.html|title=Class-action suit targets Apple for iCloud downtime|publisher=[[Apple community#AppleInsider|AppleInsider]]|first=Neil|last=Hughes|date=May 18, 2012|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2019, iCloud was introduced to Windows 10 via the [[Microsoft Store (digital)|Microsoft Store]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/06/11/apples-all-new-icloud-for-windows-app-now-available-in-the-microsoft-store/|title=Apple's all-new iCloud for Windows app, now available in the Microsoft Store|last=Sardo|first=Giorgio|date=2019-06-11|website=Windows Experience Blog|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=2019-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Announcement==
The first official mention of iCloud from Apple came on May 31, 2011, when a press release&lt;ref name="Apple PR 1"&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/05/31wwdc.html|title=Apple to Unveil Next Generation Software at Keynote Address on Monday, June 6|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=May 31, 2011|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced that it would demonstrate the service at the WWDC on June 6, 2011. A banner hung at the [[Moscone Center]] for WWDC revealed the iCloud logo five days before the official launch.&lt;ref name="IBTimes HK"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hken.ibtimes.com/articles/156604/20110602/wwdc-2011-mac-os-x-iso-5-icloud-coins-unveiled-photo-leaks.htm|title=WWDC 2011: OS X, iOS 5, iCloud coins unveiled (Photo Leaks)|publisher=International Business Times HK|first=Daniel|last=Lee|date=June 2, 2011|accessdate=June 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[WWDC 2011]] keynote speech, [[Steve Jobs]] (in one of his last public appearances) announced iCloud will replace [[MobileMe]] services and that the basic iCloud service will be free of charge.&lt;ref name="wwdc 2011 keynote"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/11piubpwiqubf06/event|title=WWDC 2011 Keynote Speech|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=June 6, 2011|accessdate=June 7, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608015224/http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/11piubpwiqubf06/event/|archive-date=June 8, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The cloud-based system allows users to store heterogenous music, photos, applications, documents, bookmarks, reminders, backups, notes, Apple Books, and contacts, and provides a platform for Apple's email servers and calendars. Third-party iOS and macOS app developers are able to implement iCloud functionality in their apps through the iCloud [[Application programming interface|API]].&lt;ref name="iCloud for devs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/icloud|title=iCloud for Developers|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backup and restore===
iCloud allows users to back up the settings and data on [[iDevices|iOS devices]] running iOS 5 or later.&lt;ref name="Backup and restore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4859|title=iCloud: Backup and Restore Overview|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=February 17, 2014|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data backed up includes photos and videos in the Camera Roll, device settings, app data, messages (iMessage, SMS, and MMS), ringtones, and Visual Voicemails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What does iCloud back up?|url=https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT207428|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backups occur daily when the device is locked and connected to Wi-Fi and a power source. In case of a malfunction of any Apple device, during the restoration process, iCloud offers to restore all data along with App data only if the device was synced to iCloud and backed up.

===Back to My Mac===
{{main|Back to My Mac}}
Back to My Mac, also previously part of [[MobileMe]], is now part of iCloud.&lt;ref name="b2mm"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/mobileme/transition.html|title=Transition from MobileMe to iCloud|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=October 12, 2011|accessdate=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As before, this service allows users to log in remotely to other computers that have Back to My Mac enabled and are configured with the same [[Apple ID]]. On August 9, 2018, Apple [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208922 updated a support document] to note that Back to My Mac would not be part of the upcoming [[macOS Mojave]] (10.14) release.

===Email===
An iCloud account can include an email account, much like [[MobileMe]], [[.Mac]], and iTools did previously. However, unlike [[MobileMe]] and its previous iterations, the email account is an optional part of an iCloud account, in that the user can choose to use a non-iCloud email address as their iCloud Apple ID. The email account can be accessed using any standard IMAP-compatible email client, as well as via web browser at iCloud.com. Additionally, on an iOS device, iCloud email is push-enabled.

Users who converted existing [[MobileMe]] accounts to iCloud accounts kept their existing "@me.com" email addresses; users whose accounts pre-dated [[MobileMe]] and had both me.com and mac.com email addresses kept both. As well as retaining their previous addresses, users also received the matching "@icloud.com" address. As there is only one mailbox per account, all messages sent to any of a user's iCloud email addresses end up in the same inbox.

===Find My Friends===
{{main|Find My Friends}}
[[Find My iPhone|Find]] My Friends was added to iCloud alongside the launch of iOS 5, allowing users to share their current location with their friends or family. iOS 6 added location-based alerts to notify the user when a device arrives at a certain location.&lt;ref name="iOS 6 New Features"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new|title=iOS 6 New Features|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=|accessdate=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On iOS 9 and 10, Find My Friends is built into iOS and cannot be removed. From iOS 11 onwards it is included, but can be deleted and then subsequently reinstalled from the iOS App Store.

In October 2015, Find My Friends was added to iCloud.com to view other "friends" locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Find My Friends pops up on iCloud.com|url = http://www.imore.com/find-my-friends-pops-icloudcom|publisher = [[Apple community#iMore|iMore]]|access-date = 2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Find My iPhone===
{{main|Find My iPhone}}
Find My iPhone, formerly part of [[MobileMe]], allows users to track the location of their iOS device or Mac. A user can see the device's approximate location on a map (along with a circle showing the radius depicting the [[margin of error]]), display a message and/or play a sound on the device (even if it is set to silent), change the password on the device, and remotely erase its contents.&lt;ref name="Apple FMI 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/icloud/features/find-my-iphone.html|title=Apple - iCloud - Find your missing Apple device.|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feature was first announced on June 10, 2009 and was included in iOS 3.0 software update as a feature for paying [[MobileMe]] users.&lt;ref name="MR FMI 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2009/06/08/iphone-os-3-0-launching-june-17th|title=iPhone OS 3.0 Launching June 17th - MMS, Tethering in Some Countries|publisher=[[MacRumors]]|first=Eric|last= Slivka|date=June 8, 2010|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Find My iPhone was made free of charge with the iOS 4.2.1 software update on November 22, 2010, but only for devices introduced in 2010.&lt;ref name=FMIP-now-free&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1155878/findmyiphone.html|title=Apple makes Find My iPhone free for some iOS 4.2 users|work=[[Macworld]]|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|first=Jason|last=Snell|date=Nov 22, 2010|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An iOS app was also released by Apple on June 18, 2010, which allows users to locate their device from other iOS devices running iOS 4 or later software.&lt;ref name=FMIP-release-date&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1152130/mobileme_updates.html|title=Apple updates MobileMe, releases Find My iPhone app|work=[[Macworld]]|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|first=David|last=Chartier|date=Jun 18, 2010|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In iOS 5, Find My iPhone was continued as a feature for iCloud. iOS 6 introduced Lost Mode, a new feature that allows the user to mark a device as "lost", making it easier to protect and find. The feature also allows someone that finds the user's lost iPhone to call the user directly without unlocking it. Similar [[Find My Phone|phone finder]] services under various names are available for other families of [[smartphone]]s.

Activation Lock was introduced in 2013 with iOS 7. It is integrated with iCloud and Find My iPhone feature. This new feature locks the activation of any iPhone, iPad, iPod touch or Apple watch which has been restored in either DFU or Recovery mode without first disabling the Find My iPhone feature. Once restore is completed, the device will ask for the Apple ID and password that has been previously associated with it, in order to proceed with activation, ultimately preventing any stolen device from being usable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201365|title=Find My iPhone Activation Lock|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201365|title=Find My iPhone Activation Lock|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of iOS 9, Find my iPhone is a built-in app, and thus cannot be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hughes|first1=Neil|title=Find My iPhone, Friends become built-in apps in Apple's first iOS 9 beta, cannot be uninstalled|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/06/10/find-my-iphone-friends-become-built-in-apps-in-apples-first-ios-9-beta-cannot-be-uninstalled|website=AppleInsider|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===iTunes Match===
{{other uses|ITunes (disambiguation)}}
[[ITunes|iTunes Match]] debuted on November 14, 2011. It was initially available to US users only.&lt;ref name="Apple IT Match 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/itunes/whats-new|title=What's new in iTunes.|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=November 14, 2011|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an annual fee, customers can scan and match tracks in their iTunes music library, including tracks copied from [[Compact disc|CDs]] or other sources, with tracks in the iTunes Store, so customers do not have to repurchase said tracks. Customers may download up to 100,000 tracks in 256&amp;nbsp;kbit/s [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-free [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] file format that match tracks in any supported audio file formats in customers' iTunes libraries, including [[Apple Lossless|ALAC]] and [[MP3]]. Customers also have the choice to keep their original copies stored on their computers or have them replaced by copies from the iTunes Store.&lt;ref name="MR IT Match 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2011/06/06/itunes-in-the-cloud-with-itunes-match-24-99year-matches-ripped-tunes-offers-them-in-the-cloud|title=iTunes Match: $24.99/Year, Matches Ripped Tunes, Offers Them In The Cloud|publisher=[[MacRumors]]|date=June 6, 2011|accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any music not available in the iTunes Store is uploaded for download onto customers' other supported devices and computers; doing this will not take storage from the customers' iCloud's storage allowance. Any such tracks stored in the higher quality [[data compression#Audio|lossless audio]] ALAC, or original uncompressed [[pulse-code modulation|PCM]] formats, [[WAV]] and [[Audio Interchange File Format|AIFF]], are [[transcoding|transcoded]] to 256&amp;nbsp;kbit/s DRM-free AAC format before uploading to the customers' iCloud storage account, leaving the original higher quality local files in their original format.&lt;ref name=ALAC-encoding&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4914|title=iTunes Store: How to subscribe to iTunes Match|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|quote=''Songs encoded in ALAC, WAV, or AIFF will be transcoded to a separate temporary AAC 256 kbps file locally, prior to uploading to iCloud. The original files will remain untouched.''|date=January 16, 2012|accessdate=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a user stops paying for the iTunes Match service, all copies of the DRM-free [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] iTunes Store versions of tracks that have already been downloaded onto any device can be kept,&lt;ref name="Apple IT Match 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/icloud/features|title=iCloud Features: iTunes in the Cloud.|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=November 14, 2011|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacWorld UK 20111116"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/163658/2011/11/itunes_match_what_you_need_to_know.html|title=iTunes Match: What you need to know|work=[[Macworld]]|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|first1=Serenity|last1=Caldwell|first2=Chris|last2=Breen|first3=Lex|last3=Friedman|date=November 16, 2011|accessdate=December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; whether on iOS devices or computers.&lt;ref name="Apple IT Match 2"/&gt;

From [[iOS 7]] and [[OS X Mavericks]], the [[iTunes Radio]] function will be available across devices, including integration with the Music app, both on portable iOS devices and [[Apple TV]] (2nd generation onwards), as well as inside the [[iTunes]] app on Macintosh and Windows computers. It will be included in an ad-free version for subscribers to the iTunes Match service and is currently{{when|date=August 2019}} available only in the [[United States|US]] and [[Australia]]&lt;ref name="iTunes Radio Apple"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-radio|title=Apple - iTunes Radio - Here where your music takes you.|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The streaming Genius shuffle is not available in current{{when|date=August 2019}} versions of [[iOS]] but is available in iTunes on the Mac.

On January 28, 2016, ad-free iTunes Radio was discontinued and is therefore no longer part of iTunes Match.

{{As of|2014|3|26|df=US}}, iTunes Match is available in 116 countries, while [[iTunes in the Cloud]] is available in 155 countries&lt;!-- NOTE: add iTunes Radio availability here when released later in 2014, with additional link(s) if needed. --&gt;.&lt;ref name="iTunes Match availability"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5085|title=iTunes in the Cloud and iTunes Match Availability.|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=August 14, 2013|accessdate=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===iWork for iCloud===
{{main|iWork}}
During the 2013 [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC) keynote speech, [[iWork]] for iCloud was announced for release at the same time as the next version of the app versions of iWork later in the year. The three apps for both iOS and macOS that form Apple's [[iWork]] suite ([[Pages (word processor)|Pages]], [[Numbers (spreadsheet)|Numbers]], and [[Keynote (presentation software)|Keynote]]), will be made available on a web interface (named as Pages for iCloud, Numbers for iCloud, and Keynote for iCloud respectively), and accessed via the iCloud website under each user's iCloud Apple ID login. They will also sync with the users iOS and macOS versions of the app, should they have them, again via their iCloud [[Apple ID]].

This allows the user to edit and create documents on the web, using one of the supported browsers; currently{{when|date=August 2019}} [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], [[Google Chrome|Chrome]], and [[Internet Explorer]]. It also means that [[Microsoft Windows]] users now have access to these native&amp;nbsp;–previously only Apple device– document editing tools, via the [[user interface|web interface]].

===Photo Stream===
Photo Stream is a service supplied with the basic iCloud service which allows users to store the most recent 1,000 photos on the iCloud servers up to 30 days free of charge. When a photo is taken on a device with Photo Stream enabled, it is automatically uploaded to the iCloud servers; from there, it is automatically pushed to the rest of the user's registered devices. Photos in Photo Stream will automatically be removed from other devices after the user reaches the 1,000-photo or 30-day limit. Users who utilize Photo Stream on their Mac or PC can choose to have all photos permanently saved on their computer&amp;nbsp;— their photos in Photo Stream will not be removed from the computer when they are dropped out of Photo Stream after the user reaches the 1,000-photo or 30-day limit. The service is also integrated with [[Apple TV]], allowing users to view their recent photos wirelessly on their [[High-definition television|HDTV]].&lt;ref name="IT PS 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.infotrends.com/?p=4366#more-4366|title=Apple's iCloud Connects People and their Photos|publisher=InfoTrends InfoBlog|date=June 8, 2011|accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===iCloud Photos===
iCloud Photos is a feature on [[IOS 8|iOS 8.1]] or later and [[OS X Yosemite]] (version 10.10) of later, plus web app access. The service stores all of the user's photos, maintaining their original resolution and metadata. Users can access their iCloud Photos on supported devices via the new Photos app when available or via the iCloud Photos web app at iCloud.com, which helps limit the amount of local storage each device needs to use in order to store photos (particularly those with smaller storage capacities) by storing lower-resolution versions on the device, with the user having the option to keep some/all stored locally at a higher resolution.

===Storage===
{{see also|Apple ID}}
Since introduction in 2011, each account has 5&amp;nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]] of free storage for owners of either an [[List of iOS devices|iOS device]] using [[IOS 5|iOS 5.x]] or later, or a [[Macintosh|Mac]] using [[Mac OS X Lion|OS X Lion 10.7]] or later. Users can purchase additional storage for a total of 50 GB, 200 [[Gigabyte|GB]] or 2 [[Terabyte|TB]]. The amount of storage is shared across all devices per iCloud [[Apple ID]].&lt;ref name="iCloud Storage Pricing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238|title=iCloud Storage Pricing|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=|accessdate=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several native features of iCloud use each user's iCloud storage allowance, specifically, Backup and restore, and email, Contacts, and Calendars. On Macs, users can also store most filetypes into iCloud folders of their choosing, rather than only storing them locally on the machine. While [[#Photo Stream|Photo Stream]] uses the iCloud servers, usage does not come out of the user's iCloud storage allowance. This is also true for [[#iTunes Match|iTunes Match]] music content, even for music that is not sold in the iTunes Store and which gets uploaded into iCloud storage, it does not count against the user's allowance. Other apps can optionally integrate app storage out of the user's iCloud storage allowance.

Not all of a user's content counts as part of their iCloud storage allowance. Apple is able to keep a permanent track of every purchase a user makes under their Apple ID account, and by associating each piece of content with the user, it means only one copy of every Store item is needed to be kept on Apple's servers. For items bought from the [[iTunes Store]] (music, music videos, movies, TV shows), [[Apple Books]] Store (books), or [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] (iOS apps), this uses a service Apple call [[iTunes in the Cloud]], allowing the user to automatically, or manually if preferred, re-download any of their previous purchases on to a Mac, PC, or iOS device.&lt;ref name="iTunes Match availability"/&gt; Downloaded (or streamed, provided the user is connected to the Internet) iTunes Store content can be used across all these devices, however, while Apple Books Store and App Store content can be downloaded to Macs and PCs for syncing to iOS devices, only [[iOS]] and Mac devices (and their respective apps) can be used to read the books.&lt;ref name="iBooks iOS and Mac"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/ibooks/|title=Apple - Buy and read books on your Mac or iOS device with iBooks.|accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, macOS apps purchased from the Mac App Store are also linked to the [[Apple ID]] they were purchased through, and are able to be downloaded to any Mac using the same Apple ID. Also, when a user registers any new device, all previously bought Store content can be downloaded from the Store servers, or non-Store content from the iCloud servers.&lt;ref name="Apple open iCloud"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/06/06/icloud|title=Apple opens iCloud to world+dog|website=[[The Register]]|first=Rik|last=Myslewski|date=June 6, 2011|accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audiobooks and their metadata fields from non-Apple purchased sources are not synced across devices (macOS or iOS) inside the Apple Books apps, and nor does the metadata from non-Apple purchased books (in Ebook or PDF format). There remains a syncing mismatch on some types of media, between Apple-purchased content and non-Apple purchased content that remains in effect for iCloud users.

===iCloud Drive===
iCloud Drive is iCloud's [[file hosting service]], that syncs files across devices running [[iOS 8]], [[OS X Yosemite]] (version 10.10), or [[Windows 7]] or later, plus online [[web application|web app]] access via iCloud.com. Users can store any kind of file (including photos, videos, documents, music, and other apps' data) in iCloud Drive and access it on any [[Macintosh|Mac]], [[iPad]], [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]], or [[Windows PC]], with any single file being a maximum of 50&amp;nbsp;GB in file size (earlier it was 15&amp;nbsp;GB). This allows users to start their work on one device and continue on another device.&lt;ref name="Apple iCD info 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/ios/ios8/icloud-drive|title=Apple - iOS 8 - iCloud Drive|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=June 2, 2014|accessdate=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By default, users still get 5&amp;nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]] of storage for free as previously, but the expandable storage plans available have increased in size (current tiers: 50&amp;nbsp;GB, 200&amp;nbsp;GB, and 2&amp;nbsp;TB), and altered to monthly subscription payment options from the yearly ones offered under the previous MobileMe service.

In [[iOS 11]], iCloud Drive has been integrated into the new [[Files (Apple)|Files]] app that gives users access to all their cloud and local on-device storage, which replaced the standalone iCloud Drive app.&lt;ref name="imore files app 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.imore.com/files-app|title=iOS 11's Files app FAQ: Everything you need to know!|work=iMore|access-date=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imore icloud files app 2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.imore.com/icloud-ios-11|title=iCloud in iOS 11 FAQ: Everything you need to know!|work=iMore|access-date=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Messages on iCloud===

Messages on iCloud is a feature on iOS 11.4 and macOS High Sierra 10.13.5 which keeps all of a user's iMessages and SMS texts stored in the cloud. Messages are synced across Macs, iPhones and iPads.

==Criticism==
iCloud has been criticized by third-party developers for [[software bug|bugs]] that make some features nearly unusable under earlier versions of iOS and macOS, specifically the use of [[Core Data]] in iCloud, for storing and syncing larger amounts of data between third party apps on users' devices.&lt;ref name="verge broken icloud"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/26/4148628/why-doesnt-icloud-just-work|title=Apple's broken promise: why doesn't iCloud 'just work'?|website=[[The Verge]]|first=Ellis|last=Hamburger|date=March 26, 2013|accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TNW broken icloud"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/apple/2013/03/27/which-icloud-actually-sucks|title=A tale of two iClouds|publisher=The Next Web|first=Matthew|last=Panzarino|date=|accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="more core data fix?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imore.com/debug-12-icloud-core-data-sync|title=Debug 12: iCloud and Core Data sync|publisher=[[Apple community#iMore|iMore]]|first=Rene|last=Richie|date=April 5, 2013|accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-party developers have reported that the changes implemented in the release of [[iOS 7]] and [[OS X Mavericks]] (version 10.9) address these iCloud criticisms.&lt;ref name="apple new core data"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTTBxyR-XsI|title=WWDC 2013: What's New in Core Data and iCloud|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|work=[[YouTube]]|first=Nick|last=Gillett|date=June 25, 2013|accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iCloud and Core Data"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.objc.io/issues/10-syncing-data/icloud-core-data/|title=iCloud and Core Data|publisher=[[objc.io]]|first=Matthew|last= Bischoff |date=March 1, 2014|accessdate=July 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name dispute===
iCloud Communications, a telecommunications company in [[Arizona]], sued Apple in June 2011 for [[trademark infringement]] shortly after Apple announced iCloud.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/57544701/iCloud-Complaint|title=iCloud Complaint|publisher=[[Scribd]]|date=|accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ibtimes0613"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hken.ibtimes.com/articles/161459/20110613/apple-icloud-sued-infringement-trademark-history.htm|title=Apple's iCloud Sued for Trademark Infringement – Lessons from its Predecessors|website=[[International Business Times]]|date=June 13, 2011|accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was filed in the US District Court of Arizona and demanded that Apple stop using the iCloud name and pay unspecified monetary damages. iCloud Communications changed its name to Clear Digital Communications in August 2011 and dropped its lawsuit against Apple shortly thereafter.&lt;ref  name="dropped"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/arizona-company-drops-icloud-suit-changes-name/|title=Arizona company drops iCloud suit, changes name|publisher=[[CNET]]|first=Steven|last=Musil|date=September 7, 2011|accessdate=March 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's iCloud service, including iCloud Drive and iOS device backups, does not provide [[end-to-end encryption]], also known as [[client-side encryption]],&lt;ref name=stackexchange&gt;{{cite web |url= http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/58508/does-icloud-use-client-side-encryption |title= Does iCloud use client-side encryption? |date= 30 July 2012 |accessdate= February 21, 2016 |website= Stack Overflow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dataconomy&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dataconomy.com/client-side-encryption-the-latest-trend-in-cloud-storage/ |title= Client Side Encryption: The Latest Trend In Cloud Storage |date= 8 April 2015 |accessdate= February 21, 2016 |author= Tunio Gaffer |website= Dataconomy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=infosectoday&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.infosectoday.com/Articles/Client-Side_Encryption.htm |title= Why Client-Side Encryption Is the Next Best Idea in Cloud-Based Data Security |date= 2015 |accessdate= February 21, 2016 |author= Tunio Zaffer |website= Information Security Today |publisher= Auerbach Publications |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160116160010/http://www.infosectoday.com/Articles/Client-Side_Encryption.htm |archive-date= January 16, 2016 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and without end-to-end encryption, users' information is left unsecured because it remains easily accessible to unauthorized persons.&lt;ref name=infosectoday/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandra2014"&gt;{{cite book |author=Deka, Ganesh Chandra |title=Handbook of Research on Securing Cloud-Based Databases with Biometric Applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iiKXBQAAQBAJ |accessdate=21 February 2016 |date=31 October 2014 |publisher=IGI Global |isbn=978-1-4666-6560-6 |chapter=3 Security Architecture for Cloud Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ackermann2012"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tobias Ackermann |title=IT Security Risk Management: Perceived IT Security Risks in the Context of Cloud Computing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3WFEAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136 |accessdate=21 February 2016 |date=22 December 2012 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-3-658-01115-4 |pages=136–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cloud Computing Sicherheit: Schutzziele, Taxonomie, Marktübersicht |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgNUcgAACAAJ |accessdate=21 February 2016 |year=2009 |publisher=Fraunhofer-Institut for Sicker Informationstechnologie SIT |isbn=978-3-9813317-0-7 |chapter=Communications of the Association for Information Systems 13:Article 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theatlanticonnsa&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/nsa-encryption-ungoverned-spaces/398423/ |title= How Dangerous Is End-to-End Encryption? |date= 14 July 2015 |author= Conor Friedersdorf |accessdate= February 23, 2016 |website= [[The Atlantic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, it was rumored that hackers had discovered an exploit involving the [[Find My iPhone]] service, which potentially allowed an attacker to [[brute-force attack|brute-force]] a user's Apple ID and access their iCloud data. The exploit was later incorrectly rumored to have been used as part of [[2014 celebrity photo leaks|an August 2014 leak]] of a large number of private, nude photos of celebrities that had been synced to their iCloud storage from their iPhone. Apple confirmed that it was working with law enforcement agencies to investigate the leak.&lt;ref name=verge-icloudhack&gt;{{cite web|title=Reported iCloud hack leaks hundreds of nude celebrity photos|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/1/6092089/nude-celebrity-hack|website=The Verge|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-celebgate&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple 'actively investigating' and FBI 'addressing' alleged hack that revealed nude celebrity photos|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/1/6094423/apple-actively-investigating-alleged-hack-nude-celebrity-jennifer-lawrence|website=The Verge|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=engadget-findmyiphoneexploit&gt;{{cite web|title='Find My iPhone' exploit may be to blame for celebrity photo hacks (update)|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/09/01/find-my-iphone-exploit/|website=Engadget|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple subsequently denied that the iCloud service itself or the alleged exploit was responsible for the leak, asserting that the leaks were the result of a very targeted [[phishing]] attack against the celebrities.&lt;ref name=verge-iclouddenied&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple denies iCloud breach in celebrity nude photo hack|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/2/6098107/apple-denies-icloud-breach-celebrity-nude-photo-hack|website=The Verge|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 13, 2014 [[Tim Cook]], while being interviewed by Charlie Rose, stated on camera that the celebrity leaks were not an iCloud exploit at all, but rather the celebrities had been phished by very targeted phishing to trick them out of their login credentials.&lt;ref name=charlierose-phishing&gt;{{cite web|title=Tim Cook talks iCloud phishing hack|url=http://macdailynews.com/2014/09/13/tim-cook-talks-icloud-phishing-iphone-6-and-more-with-charlie-rose/|website=MacDailyNews|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In February 2018, Apple announced that iCloud users in China would have their data, including encryption data, on servers located in the country to comply with local regulations. This raised concerns from human rights activists who claim that it may be used to track [[dissident]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Apple moves to store iCloud keys in China, raising human rights fears |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-apple-icloud-insight/apple-moves-to-store-icloud-keys-in-china-raising-human-rights-fears-idUSKCN1G8060 |accessdate=14 December 2018 |work=Reuters |date=26 February 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, CEO Tim Cook stated that Apple encrypts "the same in every country in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hamilton |first1=Isobel Asher |title=Tim Cook took a subtle swipe at Google over how Apple does business in China |url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/tim-cook-apple-encrypts-data-in-china-2018-10?r=US&amp;IR=T |accessdate=14 December 2018 |work=Business Insider |date=3 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
