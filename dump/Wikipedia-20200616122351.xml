The United States conducted much early research in photovoltaics and concentrated solar power. 
It is among the top countries in the world in electricity generated by the Sun and several of the world's largest utility-scale installations are located in the desert Southwest. The oldest [[List of solar thermal power stations|solar power plant]] in the world is the 354-[[megawatt]] (MW) [[Solar Energy Generating Systems|SEGS thermal power plant]], in California.&lt;ref name="Fplenergy.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fplenergy.com/portfolio/contents/segs_viii.shtml |title=Segs Iii, Iv, V, Vi, Vii, Viii &amp; Ix |publisher=Fplenergy.com |accessdate=2012-01-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805074758/http://www.fplenergy.com/portfolio/contents/segs_viii.shtml |archivedate=2014-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System]] is a [[solar thermal power]] project in the California [[Mojave Desert]], 40 miles (64&amp;nbsp;km) southwest of [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], with a gross capacity of 392&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref name=woody&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ivanpahsolar.com/ |title= Brightsource Ivanpah |access-date= 2014-03-17 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130111010740/http://ivanpahsolar.com/ |archive-date= 2013-01-11 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 280 MW [[Solana Generating Station]] is a [[solar power]] plant near [[Gila Bend, Arizona|Gila Bend]], [[Arizona]], about {{convert|70|mi}} southwest of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], completed in 2013.

==History==
[[File:US Monthly Solar Power Generation.svg|thumb|Monthly solar power generation in the United States since 2008]]
[[File:Top 5 Solar States.png|thumb|Trends in commercial solar electrical power generation in the top five states, 1990–2012 (U.S. EIA data)]]
Solar energy deployment increased at a record pace in the United States and [[Growth of photovoltaics|throughout the world]] in 2008, according to industry reports. The [[Solar Energy Industries Association]]'s "2008 [[U.S. Solar Industry Year in Review]]" found that U.S. solar energy capacity increased by 17% in 2007, reaching the total equivalent of 8,775&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt]]s (MW). The SEIA report tallies all types of solar energy, and in 2007 the United States installed 342&amp;nbsp;MW of [[photovoltaics|solar photovoltaic]] (PV) electric power, 139 [[thermal megawatt]]s ([[MWth|MW&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;]]) of [[solar water heating]], 762&amp;nbsp;MW&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; of [[pool heating]], and 21&amp;nbsp;MW&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; of solar space heating and cooling.&lt;ref name=eere03-25&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=12362 |title=Solar Energy Grew at a Record Pace in 2008 |publisher=Apps1.eere.energy.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another report in 2008 by research and publishing firm [[Clean Edge]] and the nonprofit [[Co-op America]] found that solar power's contribution could grow to 10% of the nation's power needs by 2025, with nearly 2% of the nation's electricity coming from [[concentrating solar power]] systems, while solar photovoltaic systems would provide more than 8% of the nation's electricity. 
Those figures correlate to nearly 50,000 megawatts of solar photovoltaic systems and more than 6,600&amp;nbsp;megawatts of concentrating solar power.&lt;ref name=eere2&gt;[http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=11835 Study: Solar Power Could Provide 10% of U.S. Electricity by 2025] June 25, 2008 retrieved 25 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The report noted that the cost per kilowatt-hour of solar photovoltaic systems had been dropping, while electricity generated from fossil fuels was becoming more expensive. 
As a result, the report projects that solar power was expected to reach cost parity with conventional power sources in many U.S. markets by 2015. 
To reach the 10%&amp;nbsp;goal, solar photovoltaic companies would need to make solar power a "plug-and-play technology", or simplify the deployment of solar systems.&lt;ref name=eere2/&gt;
The report also underlines the importance of future "[[smart grid]]" technologies.&lt;ref name=eere2/&gt;

Solar Energy Industries Association and GTM Research found that the amount of new solar electric capacity increased in 2012 by 76 percent from 2011, raising the United States’ market share of the world’s installations above 10 percent, up from roughly 5 to 7 percent in the past seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/business/energy-environment/solar-group-reports-surge-in-us-installations.html|title=Solar Group Reports Surge in U.S. Installations|first=Diane|last=Cardwell|date=13 March 2013|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[U.S. Energy Information Administration]], as of September 2014 utility-scale solar had sent 12,303 gigawatt-hours of electricity to the U.S. grid. This was an increase of over 100% versus the same period in 2013 (6,048 GWh).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Solar power's stunning growth: US generation up 100 percent this year |work=CNBC |date=December 2, 2014 |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/102232713 |access-date=December 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The number of homes with solar systems installed had been increasing rapidly; from 30,000 in 2006 to 1.3 million in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Solar Industry Growing at a Record Pace |work=SEIA |url=http://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-industry-data |access-date=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a study by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] predicting the figure could reach 3.8 million homes by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.ucsusa.org/how-many-homes-have-rooftop-solar-644|title=How Many Homes Have Rooftop Solar?

[[File:US Monthly Solar Capacity Factors.png|thumb|Average monthly capacity factors for electricity generation by utility-scale solar plants, 2011–2014 (data from U.S. Energy Information Administration)]]
In the United States, 14,626 MW of PV was installed in 2016, a 95% increase over 2015 (7,493 MW). 
During 2016, 22 states added at least 100 MW of capacity.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
Just 4,751 MW of PV installations were completed in 2013. The U.S. had approximately 440 MW of off-grid photovoltaics as of the end of 2010. Through the end of 2005, a majority of photovoltaics in the United States was off-grid.&lt;ref name="NREL2010Solar" /&gt;{{rp|p.6}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy10osti/46025.pdf|title=2008 Solar Technologies Market Report|author=|date=January 2010|publisher=NREL|accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of electricity a unit is capable of producing over an extended period of time is determined by multiplying the capacity by the [[capacity factor]]. 
The capacity factor for solar photovoltaic units is largely a function of climate and latitude and so varies significantly from state to state.
The [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] has calculated that the highest statewide average solar voltaic capacity factors are in Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada (each 26.3 percent), and the lowest is Alaska (10.5 percent).  The lowest statewide average capacity factor in the contiguous 48 states is in West Virginia (17.2 percent).&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Lopez, Billy Roberts, Donna Heimiller, Nate Blair, and Gian Porro, [http://www.nrel.gov/gis/re_potential.html U.S. Renewable Energy Technical Potentials: A GIS-Based Analysis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915115931/http://www.nrel.gov/gis/re_potential.html|date=2012-09-15}}, National Renewable Energy Laboratory,  Technical Report NREL/TP-6A20-51946, July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The table above gives an indication of the spread of solar PV between the different types at the end of 2018. Capacity figures may seem smaller than those quoted by other sources and it is likely that the capacities are measured in MW AC rather than MW DC, the former of which gives a lower reading due to conversion losses during the process by which power is transformed by inverters from direct current to alternating current. Utility scale PV accounted for the largest figure at 30.17 GW and 63 TWh of generation. Next came small scale PV with 19.52 GW capacity and 29.54 TWh of generation. The proportion of residential and commercial solar to utility scale solar varies greatly between states (see distributed generation section below). Finally solar thermal generation was the smallest deployment by power rating at 1.76 GW capacity and 3.59 TWh generation.

====Current situation====
Large-scale [[photovoltaic power plant]]s in the United States often consist of two or more units which correspond to construction stages and/or technology-improvement phases of a particular development project.  Typically these units are co-located in the vicinity of the same high-capacity transmission [[electrical substation|substation]],  and may also feed that substation with other large PV plants which are adjacently sited but separately developed.  As of 2018, the ten largest operating plants in the United States, based on development grouping and total [[alternating current|AC]] power capacity, are:&lt;br/&gt;
1) The 579&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt]] (MW&lt;sub&gt;[[Nominal power (photovoltaic)#Conversion from DC to AC|AC]]&lt;/sub&gt;) [[Solar Star]] plant (Units I and II) in California was the world's largest photovoltaic power station when completed in 2015. It was superseded later that year by the [[Longyangxia Dam]] Solar Park in China.&lt;br/&gt;
2) The [[Copper Mountain Solar Facility]] is a 552&amp;nbsp;MW&lt;sub&gt;[[Nominal power (photovoltaic)#Conversion from DC to AC|AC]]&lt;/sub&gt; solar power plant in [[Eldorado Valley]], Nevada that consists of four units.&lt;ref name=copmt/&gt; [[Sempra Energy|Sempra Generation]] completed the first unit in 2010,  and the latest came online in late 2016.&lt;ref name=copmt&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2010/12/americas-largest-pv-power-plant-is-now-live America's Largest PV Power Plant Is Now Live] (December 6, 2010), ''Renewable Energy World''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semprarenewables.com/project/copper-mountain-solar-4/|title=Copper Mountain Solar 4 |author=|date= |website=semprarenewables.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

10) At 250&amp;nbsp;MW&lt;sub&gt;[[Nominal power (photovoltaic)#Conversion from DC to AC|AC]]&lt;/sub&gt; each, there are five plants: [[McCoy Solar Energy Project]], [[Silver State South Solar Project]], [[California Valley Solar Ranch]], [[Stateline Solar|Desert Stateline Solar Facility]], and [[Moapa Southern Paiute Solar Project]]
====Planned PV plants====
{{update section|date=December 2017}}
[[SolarStrong]] is [[SolarCity]]'s five-year plan to build more than $1 billion in [[solar photovoltaic]] projects for privatized military housing communities across the United States. SolarCity plans to work with the country's leading privatized military housing developers to install, own and operate rooftop solar installations and provide solar electricity at a lower cost than utility power. SolarStrong is ultimately expected to create up to 300 megawatts of solar generation capacity that could provide power to as many as 120,000 military housing units, making it the largest residential photovoltaic project in American history. In November 2011, SolarCity and Bank of America Merrill Lynch announced that they have agreed to terms on financing for SolarStrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/solarcity-and-bank-of-america-merrill-lynch-move-forward-with-project-solarstrong-expected-to-build-more-than-1-billion-in-solar-projects-2011-11-30 |title=SolarCity and Bank of America Merrill Lynch Move Forward With Project SolarStrong, Expected to Build More Than $1 Billion in Solar Projects |author= |date=30 November 2011 |work=Marketwatch }}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Distributed generation===
Within the cumulative PV capacity in the United States, there has been growth in the [[distributed generation]] segment, which are all grid-connected PV installations in the residential and non-residential markets. Non-residential market includes installations on commercial, government, school and non-profit organization properties. 

Between 2000 and 2013 there had been 2,261 MW of residential solar and 4,051 MW non-residential solar installed. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Solar Market Insight Report 2013 Year in Review|date=2014|url=http://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-market-insight-report-2013-year-review|accessdate=17 July 2014|publisher=Solar Energy Industries Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a large scale PV installations in schools was the solar project of [[San Diego Unified School District]] with total of 48 sites and aggregated installed capacity of 9.17 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sandi.net/cms/lib/CA01001235/Centricity/Domain/82/newsroom/AMSOLAR_SDUSDGroundbreakingFINAL_6_3_11.pdf|title=San Diego Unified School District, AMSOLAR Corporation announce groundbreaking on solar power system June 8|date=3 June 2011|accessdate=17 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728130226/http://www.sandi.net/cms/lib/CA01001235/Centricity/Domain/82/newsroom/AMSOLAR_SDUSDGroundbreakingFINAL_6_3_11.pdf|archive-date=28 July 2014|publisher=AMSOLAR (Press Release)|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;One of the [[List of rooftop photovoltaic installations|largest rooftop installations]] for commercial properties was the 9 MW system of Holt Logistics refrigerated warehouse at the Gloucester Marine Terminal in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shahan|first1=Zachary|title=Largest Rooftop Solar Power Plant in North America Formally Completed|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2012/04/07/largest-rooftop-solar-power-plant-in-north-america-formally-completed/|accessdate=17 July 2014|publisher=Clean Technica|date=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another type of distributed generation implemented by a [[utility companies|utility company]] was the world's first grid-connected pole-attached solar panels of [[Public Service Enterprise Group]] in New Jersey. More than 174,000 PV panels are mounted on [[utility pole]]s along streets of New Jersey with aggregated capacity of 40 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar 4 All™ Fact Sheet|url=http://www.pseg.com/info/media/pdf/solar4all_factsheet.pdf|publisher=PSE&amp;G|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The State of Solar Power in the U.S.: Current Trends|url=http://www.haynesboone.com/files/Uploads/Documents/Presentation%20-%20Solar%20-108116_1.pdf|publisher=Haynes Boone|accessdate=17 July 2014|date=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2017|November}}, there were nearly 5,500 schools in the United States that had solar installations with the total capacity of approximately 910 MW.  The top five states were Nevada, California, Hawaii, Arizona, and New Jersey with 23.10%, 14.50%, 14.50%, 14.10% and 13.00% of the schools in the respective states that had installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.seia.org/research-resources/brighter-future-study-solar-us-schools-0|title=Brighter Future: A Study on Solar in U.S. Schools|date=November 2017|work=Solar Energy Industries Association|accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2018|April}}, there were total capacity of 2,562 MW of commercial solar installations from more than 4,000 companies in 7,400 locations. Top five corporations were Target, Walmart, Prologis, Apple, and Kohl's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.seia.org/sites/default/files/2018-05/SEIA-SMB-2017-Factsheet-Updated.pdf|title=Solar Means Business - Tracking Corporate Solar Adoption in the U.S.|publisher=Solar Energy Industries Association|accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar cell manufacturing===
{{update section|date=December 2017}}
[[File:SolarWorld Hillsboro Oregon.JPG|thumb|[[SolarWorld]] plant in [[Hillsboro, Oregon]]]]

In late September 2008, [[Sanyo]] Electric Company, Ltd. announced its decision to build a manufacturing plant for solar [[ingot]]s and [[wafer]]s (the building blocks for silicon solar cells) in Salem, Oregon. The plant was scheduled to begin operating in October 2009 and scheduled to reach its full production capacity of 70&amp;nbsp;megawatts (MW) of [[solar wafer]]s per year by April 2010. In April 2013 the plant closed its wafer slicing operation. In February 2016 the parent company, Panasonic, announced it would lay off 37% of the remaining workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2016/02/panasonic_to_lay_off_50_at_sal.html |title=Panasonic to lay off 50 at Salem solar panel factory|newspaper=OregonLive.com |access-date=2017-02-05 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In early October 2008, [[First Solar]], Inc. broke ground on an expansion of its [[Perrysburg, Ohio]], planned to add enough capacity to produce another 57&amp;nbsp;MW per year of solar modules at the facility, bringing its total capacity to roughly 192&amp;nbsp;MW per year. In November 2016 the company reduced the workforce in the Perrysburg plant by 20% as part of a worldwide restructuring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.wtol.com/story/33729064/first-solar-to-layoff-27-of-workers |title=First Solar's Perrysburg facility announces layoffs|last=Staff|first=WTOL |access-date=2017-02-05 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In mid-October 2008, [[SolarWorld]] AG opened a manufacturing plant in [[Hillsboro, Oregon]]. In 2016 the Hillsboro plant was the largest photovoltaic technology manufacturing plant in the Western Hemisphere. It maintains 500 megawatts of cell-manufacturing capacity and 350 MW of module-assembly capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.solarworld.de/en/group/global-strength/production-locations/hillsborooregon/ |title=Hillsboro/Oregon |newspaper=SolarWorld |access-date=2017-02-05 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapidly decreasing photovoltaic prices put General Electric's planned factory in Colorado on hold,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/intelligent-energy/ge-postpones-thin-film-solar-factory-plans/17307|title=GE postpones thin-film solar factory plans - ZDNet|first=Kirsten|last=Korosec|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to the bankruptcy of [[Konarka Technologies]], which had expected to produce 1,000&amp;nbsp;MW of solar modules per year by 2011, and [[Solyndra]], which defaulted on a $535 million loan guarantee, prompting Republican members of the Energy and Commerce committee to vote to cease accepting new applications to the loan program.
[[HelioVolt Corporation]] opened a manufacturing facility in [[Austin, Texas]] that will have an initial capacity to produce 20&amp;nbsp;MW of solar cells per year. Starting with [[Organic solar cell#Organic solar ink|solar "inks"]] developed at DOE's [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] that are deposited with [[ink jet]]s, HelioVolt employs a proprietary "printing" process to produce solar cells consisting of thin films of copper indium gallium selenide, or [[Copper indium gallium selenide|CIGS]]. The technology won an [[R&amp;D 100 Award]] in 2008 and it earned an Editor's Choice Award for Most Revolutionary Technology. HelioVolt's "[[FASST]]" reactive transfer printing process is 10–100&amp;nbsp;times faster than other CIGS production processes and can also be combined with [[vacuum evaporation]] or [[ultrasonic spray deposition]] techniques. At its new Austin manufacturing plant, HelioVolt plans to produce both solar modules and next-generation building-integrated solar products using its FASST process.

In 2012 the U.S. Department of Commerce placed a 31% tariff on solar cells made in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solsystemscompany.com/blog/2012/06/12/implications-of-the-us-china-solar-tariff-on-project-development/|title=Implications of the US-China Solar Tariff on Project Development - Sol Systems|website=Sol Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the Trump administration placed a 30% tariff on all imported solar equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/370895-solar-company-puts-hold-on-20m-us-investment-following-new-tariff|title=Solar company puts hold on $20M US investment following new tariff|first=Geoffrey|last=Rowland|date=26 January 2018|website=TheHill}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, [[SolarCity]] broke ground on a [[Gigafactory 2|solar panel manufacturing plant]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]. 
Upon its completion in 2016, it was projected to be the largest solar manufacturing facility in the Western hemisphere, with an annual manufacturing capacity of 1 gigawatt (GW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wivb.com/2014/09/23/solarcity-investing-5b-in-buffalo-creating-3000-jobs/|title=SolarCity investing $5B in Buffalo, creating 3,000 jobs|date=23 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141004032429/http://wivb.com/2014/09/23/solarcity-investing-5b-in-buffalo-creating-3000-jobs/|archivedate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2019 the facility has not met the projections on production or job creation.&lt;ref&gt;https://buffalonews.com/2019/11/08/pennies-on-the-dollar-the-tesla-plant-isnt-worth-nearly-what-the-state-paid-to-build-it/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concentrated solar power (CSP)==
[[File:Nevada Solar One.jpg|thumb|[[Nevada Solar One]], with the [[Las Vegas Valley]] beyond the mountains behind it.]]
===History===
One of the first applications of concentrated solar was the  {{convert|6|hp}} solar powered motor made by H.E. Willsie and John Boyle in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radford.edu/wkovarik/envhist/5progressive.html|title=Environmental History Timeline|access-date=2012-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726220829/http://www.radford.edu/wkovarik/envhist/5progressive.html|archive-date=2012-07-26|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early solar pioneer of the 19th and 20th century, [[Frank Shuman]], built a demonstration plant that used solar power to pump water using an array of mirrors in a trough to generate steam. Located in Philadelphia, the solar water pump station was capable of pumping {{convert|3000|USgal|l}} an hour at that latitude, corresponding to {{convert|25|hp}}.&lt;ref&gt;''The Power of Light: The Epic Story of Man's Quest to Harness the Sun'',  Frank Kryza, {{ISBN|9780071400213}} p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; After seven weeks&lt;!--verify--&gt; of testing the plant was disassembled and shipped to Egypt for testing as an irrigation plant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-t0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA843&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+Science+installing+linoleum&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y4zsT9OSGMriqAGU1PW8BQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Sun Power Operates Pumping Plant"] ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', December 1911, pp. 843–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===CSP capacity and generation===
Abengoa's 280 MWac of CSP project was brought online in the 3rd quarter and Genesis Solar's first phase of 125 MWac was brought online in the 4th quarter of 2013 bringing the total to 410 MWac for the year and 918 MWac total. Ivanpah is already completed during the first quarter of 2014 the current world's largest CSP power plant is 392 MWac and brings the total to 1310 MWac. 
The 110 MWac Crescent Dunes project started commissioning during February. 
The 250 MWac Mojave solar, second phase 125 MWac Genesis Solar, and Tooele Army Depot Solar's 1.5 MWac power plant are all expected to come online in 2014.&lt;ref name="SEIA Q4 2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-market-insight-report-2013-year-review|title=U.S. Solar Market Insight Q4 2013|author=SEIA|publisher=SEIA|date=Dec 2013|accessdate=2014-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government support==
A complete list of incentives is maintained at the Database of State Incentives for Renewable Energy (DSIRE) (see external link). 
Most solar power systems are grid connected and use [[net metering]] laws to allow use of electricity in the evening that was generated during the daytime. 
[[New Jersey]] leads the nation with the least restrictive net metering law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsireusa.org/ |title=Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency |publisher=Dsireusa.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[California]] leads in total number of homes which have solar panels installed. Many were installed because of the million solar roof initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsc.ncsu.edu/programs/million_solar_roofs_initiative.cfm|title=NC Clean Energy Technology Center - Advancing Clean Energy for a Sustainable Economy|website=www.ncsc.ncsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some states, such as [[Solar power in Florida|Florida]], solar power is subject to legal restrictions that discourage its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-no-solar-20140810-story.html|title=Rules prevent solar panels in many states with abundant sunlight|first=Evan|last=Halper|date=9 August 2014|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Federal===
The federal tax credit for solar was extended for eight years as part of the [[Public Law 110-343|financial bail out bill]], H.R.&amp;nbsp;1424, until the end of 2016. It was estimated this will create 440,000 jobs, 28&amp;nbsp;gigawatts of solar power, and lead to a $300&amp;nbsp;billion market for solar panels. This estimate did not take into account the removal of the $2,000 cap on residential tax credits at the end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/2177/83/ Solar Investment Credit FINALLY Passed!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006091849/http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/2177/83/ |date=2008-10-06 }} retrieved 13&amp;nbsp;October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=March 2016}} A 30% tax credit is available for residential and commercial installations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityscapecapital.com/federal_solar_tax_credits.asp Federal Solar Tax Credits] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008035943/http://www.cityscapecapital.com/federal_solar_tax_credits.asp |date=2008-10-08 }} Retrieved 15&amp;nbsp;August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsireusa.org/library/includes/incentive2.cfm?Incentive_Code=US37F Residential Solar and Fuel Cell Tax Credit]{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved 15&amp;nbsp;August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; For 2009 through 2011 this was a 30% grant, not a tax credit, known as the 1603 grant program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/blog/post/2012/03/26-senators-go-on-the-record-we-dont-support-solar-jobs-or-any-renewable-energy-jobs|title=Why the 1603 Treasury Grant Program Matters to Solar and RE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal Residential Energy Efficient Property Credit ([[Income tax in the United States|income tax]] credit on IRS Form 5695) for residential PV and solar thermal was extended in December 2015 to remain at 30% of system cost (parts and installation) for systems put into service by the end of 2019, then 26% until the end of 2020, and then 22% until the end of 2021. It applies to a taxpayer's principal and/or second residences, but not to a property that is rented out. There is no maximum cap on the credit, and the credit can be applied toward the [[Alternative Minimum Tax]], and any excess credit (greater than that year's tax liability) can be rolled into the following year.&lt;ref name="USDOE-Res-Ren-Eng-Tax"&gt;{{cite web|title=Residential Renewable Energy Tax Credit|url=http://energy.gov/savings/residential-renewable-energy-tax-credit|website=Energy.gov|publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US-EPA-Tac-Credits"&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Income Tax Credits for Energy Efficiency|url=https://www.energystar.gov/about/federal_tax_credits|website=EnergyStar.gov|publisher=US EPA|accessdate=December 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solar industry and utilities clashed extensively on renewal, but the solar industry prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/solar-firms-utilities-clash-30-tax-credit-fades-mike-morris|title=Solar Firms, Utilities Clash As 30% Tax Credit Fades|date=8 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renewal is expected to add $38 billion of investment for 20 GigaWatts of solar.&lt;ref name="blooPTC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-17/what-just-happened-to-solar-and-wind-is-a-really-big-deal|title=Forget Oil Exports—What Just Happened to Solar is a Really Big Deal|date=17 December 2015|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Section 1603 grants====
President Obama’s stimulus bill in 2009 created a program known as [[Section 1603 grants]]. The program was designed to give federal grants to solar companies for 30 percent of investments into solar energy. Since 2009, the federal government has given solar companies $25 billion in grant money through this program. The Section 1603 grant program expired in 2011.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/recovery/Documents/STATUS%20OVERVIEW.pdf|title=Overview and Status Update of the §1603 Program|last=|first=|date=2016-05-05|website=United States Department of the Treasury|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 9, 2016, Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] requested from Department of Treasury, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) and the [[Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration]] (TIGTA) details about how companies use Section 1603 grants and tax credits. In March 2016, Hatch asked the IRS and Treasury Department to demonstrate that the agencies use safeguards and coordinate with each other when reviewing applications for Section 1603 grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/hatch-continues-inquiry-of-green-energy-programs|title=Hatch Continues Inquiry of Green Energy Programs|last=|first=|date=2016-06-09|website=U.S. Senate Finance Committee|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) announced on September&amp;nbsp;29, 2008 that it will invest $17.6&amp;nbsp;million, subject to annual [[Appropriation (law)|appropriations]], in six company-led, early-stage photovoltaic (PV) projects under the [[Solar America Initiative]]'s "PV&amp;nbsp;Incubator" funding opportunity, designed to fund prototype PV components and systems with the goal of moving them through the commercialization process by 2010 and make it cost-competitive with conventional forms of electricity by 2015 ([[grid parity]]).&lt;ref name=eere09-29&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=12000 |title=DOE to Invest $17.6 Million in Six Early-Stage Photovoltaic Projects |publisher=Apps1.eere.energy.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/ |title=EERE: Solar Energy Technologies Program Home Page |publisher=.eere.energy.gov |accessdate=2012-01-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219172335/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/ |archivedate=2011-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
====SunShot Initiative====
The [[SunShot Initiative]] aimed to reduce the cost of solar power by 75% from 2010 to 2020. The name is based on "moon shot", Kennedy's target of reaching the moon within the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/sunshot/mission_vision_goals.html|title=SunShot Initiative|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goals:
* Residential system prices reduced from $6/W to $1.50/W
* Commercial system prices reduced from $5/W to $1.25/W
* Utility-scale system prices reduced from $4/W to $1.00/W (CSP, CPV and PV)

====Trump administration====
In 2018, as part of the ongoing [[China–United States trade war|trade war between the U.S. and China]], President Donald J. Trump imposed tariffs on imported solar cells.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-solar-insight/billions-in-u-s-solar-projects-shelved-after-trump-panel-tariff-idUSKCN1J30CT Billions in U.S. solar projects shelved after Trump panel tariff]. Reuters. June 7, 2018. Accessed April 22, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; The push for tariffs to protect American manufacturing and jobs in the solar power industry began in April 2017, when a bankrupt Georgia-based solar cell maker filed a trade complaint that a flood of cheap imports put them at a severe disadvantage. In response, the President imposed 30% tariffs of solar imports in January 2018.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-trump-solar-tariffs-20180530-story.html|title=Trump tariffs are helping more than double U.S. solar capacity|last=|first=|date=May 30, 2018|work=Bloomberg (via the LA Times)|access-date=June 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solar industry is currently one of the fastest growing in the United States, employing more than 250,000 people as of 2018.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; On one hand, these tariffs forced the cancellation or scaling down of many projects and restrict the ability of companies to recruit more workers.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; On the other hand, they have the intended effect of incentivizing domestic manufacturing. Many solar power companies are transitioning towards automation and consequently will become less dependent on imports, especially from China.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Analysts believe Trump's tariffs have made a clear impact. Without them, the manufacturing capacity for solar cells in the United States would likely not have increased significantly, from 1.8 gigawatts in 2017 to at least 3.4 gigawatts in 2018, they argue. However, because of the increasing reliance on automation, not that many new jobs will be created, while profits will flow to other countries, as many firms are foreign.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; By 2019, the solar power industry has recovered from the initial setbacks due to Trump's tariffs, thanks to initiatives from various states, such as California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/05/after-being-rocked-by-trump-tariffs-the-solar-energy-business-is-bouncing-back.html|title=After being rocked by Trump tariffs, the solar energy business is bouncing back|last=Rogers|first=Kate|date=April 5, 2019|work=CNBC|access-date=June 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is receiving considerable support from the Department of Energy. The [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL) launched the "American-made Solar Prize" competition in June 2018 and has handed out tens to hundreds of thousand of dollars in cash prizes for the most promising solar cell designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2019/06/09/us-solar-cell-innovators-tackle-us-manufacturing-challenges/|title=US Solar Cell Innovators Tackle US Manufacturing Challenges|last=Casey|first=Tina|date=June 9, 2019|work=Clean Technica|access-date=June 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prices of solar cells continue to decline.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

====Feed-in Tariffs====
Experience has demonstrated that a [[feed-in tariff]] is both the least expensive and the most effective means of developing solar power. Investors need certainty, which they receive from a feed-in tariff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarserver.com/solarmagazin/newsa2007_07_e.html#epiael|title=404|website=www.solarserver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; California enacted a feed-in tariff which began on February 14, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyaccess.com/rea/news/story?id=50748 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120910145621/http://www.renewableenergyaccess.com/rea/news/story?id=50748 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-10 |title=Are Feed-in Tariffs a Possibility in California? |publisher=Renewableenergyaccess.com |accessdate=2012-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/news/enn.cfm#id_11562 |title=California Approves Feed-In Tariffs, Rewards Energy Efficiency |publisher=Eere.energy.gov |date=2012-01-25 |accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state has a feed-in tariff of 15&amp;nbsp;¢/kWh which increases to 54&amp;nbsp;¢/kWh if components are manufactured in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyaccess.com/rea/news/story?id=28478 |title=Washington State Passes Progressive Renewable Energy Legislation |publisher=Renewableenergyaccess.com |accessdate=2012-01-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213044152/http://www.renewableenergyaccess.com/rea/news/story?id=28478 |archivedate=2007-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hawaii]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=HI29F&amp;re=1&amp;ee=0|title=Hawaii FIT|access-date=2012-08-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030190532/http://www.dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=HI29F&amp;re=1&amp;ee=0|archive-date=2012-10-30|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michigan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=MI24F&amp;re=1&amp;ee=0|title=Consumers Energy FIT|access-date=2012-08-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030164113/http://www.dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=MI24F&amp;re=1&amp;ee=0|archive-date=2012-10-30|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vermont]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=VT36F&amp;re=1&amp;ee=0|title=Vermont SPEED|access-date=2012-08-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030212049/http://www.dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=VT36F&amp;re=1&amp;ee=0|archive-date=2012-10-30|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; also have feed in tariffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsireusa.org/summarytables/finre.cfm|title=Table of Financial Incentives|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119160142/http://dsireusa.org/summarytables/finre.cfm|archivedate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ruled that states were able to implement above-market feed-in tariffs for specific technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wind-works.org/FeedLaws/USA/FederalRegulatorBlastsOpenDoortoDifferentiatedFeed-inTariffsinUSA.html|title=FERC Decision Clears the Way for Multi-Tiered State FITs|access-date=2012-07-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617021156/http://www.wind-works.org/FeedLaws/USA/FederalRegulatorBlastsOpenDoortoDifferentiatedFeed-inTariffsinUSA.html|archive-date=2012-06-17|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/08/how-to-design-feed-in-tariffs-in-the-u-s-without-fear-of-federal-preemption How to Design Feed-in Tariffs in the U.S. without Fear of Federal Preemption]
&lt;/ref&gt;
====Solar Renewable Energy Certificates====
In recent years, states that have passed Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) or Renewable Electricity Standard (RES) laws have relied on the use of [[Solar renewable energy certificates]] (SRECs) to meet state requirements. This is done by adding a specific solar carve-out to the state [[Renewable Portfolio Standard]] (RPS). The first SREC program was implemented in 2005 by the state of [[Solar power in New Jersey|New Jersey]] and has since expanded to several other states, including Maryland, Delaware, Ohio, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=NREL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/52868.pdf|title=Solar Renewable Energy Certificate (SREC) Markets: Status and Trends|publisher=[[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]]|date=November 2011|first1=Lori|last1=Bird|first2=Jenny|last2=Heeter|first3=Claire|last3=Kreycik|accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An SREC program is an alternative to the feed-in tariff model popular in Europe. The key difference between the two models is the market-based mechanism that drives the value of the SRECs, and therefore the value of the subsidy for solar. In a feed-in tariff model, the government sets the value for the electricity produced by a solar facility. If the level is higher, more solar power is built and the program is more costly. If the feed-in tariff is set lower, less solar power is built and the program is ineffective. The problem with SRECs is a lack of certainty for investors. A feed-in tariff provides a known return on investment, while an SREC program provides a possible return on investment.
====Power Purchase Agreements====
In 2006 investors began offering free solar panel installation in return for a 25-year contract, or [[Power Purchase Agreement]], to purchase electricity at a fixed price, normally set at or below current electric rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmarenewableventures.com/Programs/Solar.html |title=MMA Renewable Ventures Solar Energy Program |publisher=Mmarenewableventures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyaccess.com/rea/news/story?id=49104 |title=U.S. Retailers Save with Solar PV &amp; Energy Efficiency |publisher=Renewableenergyaccess.com |accessdate=2012-01-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012192101/http://www.renewableenergyaccess.com/rea/news/story?id=49104 |archive-date=2007-10-12 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009 over 90% of commercial photovoltaics installed in the United States were installed using a power purchase agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/research/report/solar-power-services-how-ppas-are-changing-the-pv-value-chain |first1=Jon |last1=Guice |first2=John D.H. |last2=King |title=Solar Power Services: How PPAs are Changing the PV Value Chain |publisher=Green Tech Media |work=greentechmedia.com }} [http://fgamedia.org/faculty/afirouzi/ENGR600/lesson05/reading/Greentech%20Media%20-%20Solar%20Power%20Services%20Summary%20-%202008.pdf executive report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425230512/http://fgamedia.org/faculty/afirouzi/ENGR600/lesson05/reading/Greentech%20Media%20-%20Solar%20Power%20Services%20Summary%20-%202008.pdf |date=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 90% of the photovoltaics installed in the United States is in states that specifically address power purchase agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewspower.com/_power_purchase_agreement.php|title=Power Purchase Agreement|access-date=2012-07-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409061739/http://www.ewspower.com/_power_purchase_agreement.php|archive-date=2012-04-09|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====New construction mandates====
In March 2013, [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster California]] became the first U.S. city to mandate the inclusion of solar panels on new homes, requiring that "every new housing development must average 1 kilowatt per house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Lancaster-CA-Becomes-First-US-City-to-Require-Solar| title=Lancaster, CA, Becomes First US City to Require Solar| date = March 27, 2013 | publisher = Greentech Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===PACE===
{{main|PACE financing}}
An [[innovative financing]] arrangement pioneered in [[Berkeley, California]], and [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], lends money to a homeowner for a solar system, to be repaid via an additional tax assessment on the property for 20 years.  This allows installation of the solar system at "relatively little up-front cost to the property owner."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofberkeley.info/ContentDisplay.aspx?id=26580 Berkeley FIRST] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602054309/http://www.cityofberkeley.info/ContentDisplay.aspx?id=26580 |date=2013-06-02 }}. Retrieved October 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Now known as PACE, for Property Assessed Clean Energy, it is available in 28 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsireusa.org/documents/summarymaps/PACE_Financing_Map.pdf|title=Property Accessed Clean Energy|access-date=2012-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019114446/http://www.dsireusa.org/documents/summarymaps/PACE_Financing_Map.pdf|archive-date=2012-10-19|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have objected to the repayment of solar loans being senior to mortgage loans, and some states have relegated PACE loans to junior loans. HR 2599 was introduced to prevent interference with the PACE program by other lenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.2599:|title=Bill Summary &amp; Status|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal feature of the program is that the balance of the loan is transferred to the new owners in the event the property is sold, and the loan is paid for entirely through electric bill savings. Unlike a mortgage loan, no funds are transferred when the property is sold - only the repayment obligation is transferred. PACE programs are currently operating in eight states, California, Colorado, Florida, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, New York, and Wisconsin, and are on hold in many others, pending resolution of the Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae objection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/solarpolicyguide/?id=26|title=PACE Financing|access-date=2012-08-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021172847/http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/solarpolicyguide/?id=26|archive-date=2012-10-21|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Controversy and congressional investigation===
In 2016, the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Senate Finance Committee]] and the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means Committee]] ran a formal investigation into billions of dollars in tax incentives that solar-energy companies received. The investigation also focused on whether the Obama administration improperly gave out solar tax credits. The investigational probe was led by Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] (R-Utah), the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and U.S. Representative [[Kevin Brady]] (R-Texas), the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
