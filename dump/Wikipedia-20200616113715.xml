She ran an upscale [[prostitution]] ring based in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and is often referred to as the "[[Hollywood]] Madam".

==Early life==
Fleiss was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. Her parents, [[Paul M. Fleiss]] (1933–2014), a [[Jewish American]] pediatrician,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewornotjew.com/profile.jsp?ID=922|title=Jew or Not Jew: Heidi Fleiss|website=www.jewornotjew.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-fleiss26-2008jun26-story.html|title=Heidi Fleiss ruffles feathers in new documentary|date=June 26, 2008|website=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Elissa (née Ash), divorced.&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-paul-fleiss-20140720-story.html|title=Dr. Paul Fleiss Dies at 80; Father of 'Hollywood Madam' Heidi Fleiss|first=David|last=Colker|date=July 19, 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=July 20, 2014 | archivedate=July 20, 2014 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140720081015/http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-paul-fleiss-20140720-story.html | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.com/Life-Love/Sex-Relationships/The-Once-and-Future-Madam |title=The Once and Future Madam |accessdate=July 8, 2015 |authorlink=Ariel Levy (journalist) | first=Ariel |last=Levy|date=February 2008 |work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100527185406/http://www.elle.com/Life-Love/Sex-Relationships/The-Once-and-Future-Madam |archivedate=May 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has a brother, Jesse, and had another brother, Jason, who drowned on December 28, 2009 at the age of 41 off the coast of [[Hawaii]].{{cn|date=May 2020}} She also has three sisters, Amy, Kim, and Shana,&lt;ref name=LATimes /&gt; the last of whom is the youngest sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-09/magazine/tm-52712_1_heidi-fleiss |title=Did father know best? |first=Shawn |last=Hubler |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 9, 1995 |accessdate=January 20, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302123854/http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-09/magazine/tm-52712_1_heidi-fleiss |archivedate=March 2, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work in prostitution and criminal charges==
At the age of 22, Fleiss began managing a prostitution ring under Madam Alex after meeting her in 1987 via Fleiss's film-director boyfriend [[Ivan Nagy (director)|Ivan Nagy]]. Fleiss stated in 2002 that Alex and herself had "a very intense relationship" and that she "was kind of like the daughter she loved and hated, so she was abusive and loving at the same time." In the same interview, Fleiss said she was a prostitute for a short period to learn all aspects of the occupation. At the time, she was learning to take over Alex's business, there was a labor shortage as most of Alex's prostitutes were approaching middle age and setting their sights on retiring from prostitution. Alex tasked Heidi with revitalizing the business by recruiting a new batch of young, attractive women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0202/08/lkl.00.html | title = Life and Times of Heidi Fleiss |date=February 8, 2002|accessdate= November 25, 2015 | work=[[Larry King Live]]| publisher= (transcript) [[CNN]] | archivedate= August 6, 2003 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030806080552/http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0202/08/lkl.00.html | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1990, Fleiss severed her links with Madam Alex and began her own prostitution ring. Fleiss has stated that she made her "first million [dollars] after only four months in the business" as a madam, and that on her slowest night, she made $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/September-October-2003/feature_fleiss_sepoct03.msp |title=In Defense Of Prostitution |author=Nadya Labi |work=[[Legal Affairs]] |publisher=[[Yale Law School]] |date=September–October 2003 |accessdate=November 25, 2015 |archivedate=September 28, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928183550/http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/September-October-2003/feature_fleiss_sepoct03.msp |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1991 and 1992, she was so successful that she began rejecting women looking to work for her. In June 1993, she was arrested for multiple charges, including attempted [[procuring (prostitution)|pandering]].

Federal charges were filed in 1994, and Fleiss posted $1,000,000 bail. The state trial began the same year and Fleiss was convicted. In May 1996, her state conviction was overturned, and her appeal bond was set at $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/30/us/conviction-quashed-in-heidi-fleiss-case.html | agency= [[Associated Press]] | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Conviction Quashed In Heidi Fleiss Case | date=May 30, 1996| accessdate= November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleiss was convicted of federal charges of [[tax evasion]] in September 1996 and sentenced to seven years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/08/us/heidi-fleiss-given-37-month-sentence.html | work=The New York Times | title=Heidi Fleiss Given 37-Month Sentence | date=January 8, 1997| accessdate= November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleiss served 20 months at the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Dublin]] in California. She was released to a [[halfway house]] on November 19, 1998, and ordered to perform 370 hours of community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/20/local/me-45578 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Hollywood Madam Heidi Fleiss Placed in Halfway House | date=November 20, 1998 | accessdate= November 25, 2015| archivedate= October 18, 2015| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151018144841/http://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/20/local/me-45578|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleiss was released from the halfway house in September 1999.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Fleiss's ring reportedly had numerous prominent and wealthy [[Client (prostitution)|clients]]. When questioned by British TV presenter [[Davina McCall]] about revealing the names of her clients, she replied, "It's not my style."&lt;ref name="time1994"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Jill |last=Smolowe |title=A High Price to Pay | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982002,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 19, 1994 |accessdate=July 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media appearances==
In 1995, [[Nick Broomfield]] made a documentary about her prostitution ring called ''[[Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood Madam]]''. In 2004, a [[Television film|made-for-TV movie]] was produced called ''[[Call Me: The Rise and Fall of Heidi Fleiss]]'', in which Fleiss was portrayed by actress [[Jamie-Lynn Sigler]].

Fleiss and reality-TV personality [[Victoria Sellers]] hosted and produced an instructional DVD titled ''Sex Tips with Heidi Fleiss and Victoria Sellers'' in 2001.&lt;ref name=troubled&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Guy|title=Celebrity children: The troubled world of Victoria Sellers|work=Media|publisher=Independent Print|date=5 October 2006|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/celebrity-children-the-troubled-world-of-victoria-sellers-418766.html|accessdate=19 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleiss has had a column, "Ask Heidi", in the magazine ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In January 2010, Fleiss was the third housemate to enter the final Channel 4 series of ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 2010 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' in the UK;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8438720.stm |title=Celebrity Big Brother 2010 contestants unveiled |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=January 3, 2010 |accessdate=January 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was the second to be evicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2010/01/15/katia-ivanova-and-heidi-fleiss-evicted-from-celebrity-big-brother-115875-21970955/ |title=Katia Ivanova and Heidi Fleiss evicted from Celebrity Big Brother |work=[[Daily Mirror]] | location=UK| first=Ann|last=Gripper|date=January 15, 2010 |accessdate=January 15, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150619091214/http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/katia-ivanova-and-heidi-fleiss-evicted-195097| archivedate= June 19, 2015 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; She did not return for the finale.

In August 2013, Nevada police found nearly 400 marijuana plants growing at her [[Pahrump, Nevada]], home, but did not arrest Fleiss and submitted their report to the district attorney's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/14/us/nevada-heidi-fleiss/index.html |title=Marijuana plants found at 'Hollywood Madam' Heidi Fleiss' Nevada home|first=Amanda|last= Watts |publisher=CNN |date=August 14, 2013 |accessdate=August 14, 2013 | archivedate= July 2, 2015| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150702010130/http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/14/us/nevada-heidi-fleiss/index.html | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business interests==
In 2005, Fleiss announced plans to open a [[brothel]] in [[Pahrump, Nevada]] called "Heidi Fleiss's Stud Farm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lasvegasnow.com/Global/story.asp?S=3388672 |title=I-Team Exclusive Interview With Heidi Fleiss |accessdate=February 8, 2008 |last=Knapp |first=George | authorlink=George Knapp (journalist)|date=May 26, 2005 |publisher=[[KLAS-TV]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_345213.html |title=Heidi Fleiss eager again to do what she does best |accessdate=February 8, 2008 |date=June 19, 2005 |work=[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212084921/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_345213.html |archivedate=February 12, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Fleiss opened a [[laundromat]] called "Dirty Laundry" in Pahrump, as her plans for the brothel had been put on hold due to a "slight complication."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,287652,00.html |title=Heidi Fleiss Opens 'Dirty' Laundromat |accessdate=February 8, 2008 |first=Pat|last= Lalama |date=July 2, 2007 |publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, she said that she had abandoned her plans to open such a brothel because she did not want to "deal with all the nonsense in the sex business". Instead, she said, she would focus on [[renewable energy]], which she described as "perfect for Nevada" and "the wave of the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/heidi-fleiss-gives-up-on-plan-for-brothel-for-women/ |title=Heidi Fleiss gives up on plan for brothel for women] |work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]| date= February 10, 2009 |accessdate= May 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She opened a fashion boutique in Los Angeles after being released from prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/heidi-fleiss-8217-new-risqu-233-business-1492198/|title=Heidi Fleiss' New Risqué Business|last=Staff|first=WWD|date=2003-12-17|work=WWD|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

In 2003, Fleiss accused her ex-boyfriend, actor [[Tom Sizemore]], of [[domestic violence]].title=Sizemore Convicted of Abusing Fleiss |first=Stephen M. |last=Silverman | date=August 18, 2003 | work=[[People (magazine)|People.com]] | accessdate=July 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleiss eventually moved to [[Pahrump, Nevada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lasvegasnow.com/Global/story.asp?S=3382916 |last=Knapp |first=George  | title = Famous Hollywood Madam Moves to Nevada |date=May 24, 2005 |publisher=[[KLAS-TV]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103014111/http://www.8newsnow.com/Global/story.asp?S=3382916 |archivedate=January 3, 2014 |accessdate=June 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where she came to live in a small town near  [[Death Valley]]&lt;ref name=ActingOut&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/video/celebrity-rehab-3/full-episodes/acting-out/1632448/playlist.jhtml|title=Video of ''Celebrity Rehab'' Episode 3.8 ("Acting Out") at VH1.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; while caring for 25 parrots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/|title=Las Vegas News &amp;#124; Breaking News &amp; Headlines|website=Las Vegas Review-Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Drew Pinsky]], who treated Fleiss for [[substance abuse]], performed [[brain scan]]s on her that showed significant [[frontal lobe]] dysfunction, which Pinsky surmised was behind her inability to empathize with people, and her affinity for doing so with birds.&lt;ref name=RochlinOnline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguidemagazine.com/feature/addicted-to-rehab-3861.html |title= Addicted to Rehab|accessdate=January 30, 2010|first=Margy |last=Rochlin |date= February 1, 2010|work=[[TV Guide]]| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100129133014/http://www.tvguidemagazine.com/feature/addicted-to-rehab-3861.html | archivedate= January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had developed a particular closeness to a [[macaw]] called Dalton that later died.&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Fleiss: Would-Be Madam Of Crystal. SBS TV, December 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Fleiss was treated for substance abuse at the Pasadena Recovery Center, which was filmed for the third season of ''[[Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew]]''. One of her fellow patients was Sizemore, against whom her prior restraining order had lapsed. Both Fleiss and Sizemore consented to appear together on the show before filming began,&lt;ref name=RochlinOnline/&gt; and their reunion, depicted in the third episode, was amicable,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/video/celebrity-rehab-3/full-episodes/new-patients/1630618/playlist.jhtml|title=Video of ''Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew'', Episode 3.4 ("New Patients") at VH1.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Fleiss subsequently expressed mixed feelings about his presence there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/video/celebrity-rehab-3/full-episodes/loss/1631249/playlist.jhtml|title=Video of ''Celebrity Rehab'' Episode 3.5 ("Loss") at VH1.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the filming of the program, Fleiss left the center and was involved in an accident with her [[SUV]] near her home in Nevada. She subsequently returned to rehab.&lt;ref name=ActingOut/&gt;

After completing treatment for substance abuse, Fleiss briefly became engaged to [[Dennis Hof]], owner of Nevada's [[Moonlite BunnyRanch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/fleiss-to-marry-brothel-boss_1107760 | title=Fleiss to Marry Brothel Boss | date=June 25, 2009 | agency= [[World Entertainment News Network]] | publisher=ContactMusic.com | accessdate=July 28, 2009| archivedate=November 25, 2015| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20151125052347/http://www.contactmusic.com/heidi-fleiss/news/fleiss-to-marry-brothel-boss_1107760 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleiss said in 1994 that she is a vegetarian.&lt;ref name="time1994"/&gt;
