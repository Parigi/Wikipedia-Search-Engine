'''''Maya''''' (stylised as '''''ΛΛ Λ Y Λ''''') is the third studio album by British recording artist  [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]], released on 7 July 2010 on her own label, [[N.E.E.T. Recordings]], through [[XL Recordings]] and [[Interscope Records]]. 

Songwriting and production for the album were primarily handled by M.I.A., [[Blaqstarr]] and [[Rusko (musician)|Rusko]]. M.I.A.'s long-time associates [[Diplo (DJ)|Diplo]], [[Switch (house DJ)|Switch]] and her brother Sugu Arulpragasam also worked on the album, which was mainly composed and recorded at M.I.A.'s house in Los Angeles. The album's tracks centre on the theme of information politics and are intended to evoke what M.I.A. called a "digital [[wiktionary:ruckus|ruckus]]". Elements of [[industrial music]] were incorporated into M.I.A.'s sound for the first time. A deluxe edition was released simultaneously, featuring four bonus tracks. 

Critics' opinions of the album were generally favourable although divided, with both its musical style and lyrical content each attracting praise and criticism. In its first week of release, the album entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number 21, becoming her highest-charting album in the UK. It also became her highest-charting album in the US, reaching number nine on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and debuted in the top 10 in Finland, Norway, Greece and Canada.

M.I.A. promoted the album by releasing a series of tracks online, including "[[XXXO]]", "[[It Takes a Muscle]]" and "[[Born Free (M.I.A. song)|Born Free]]", the latter of which was accompanied by a [[Born Free (music video)|short film-music video]], which generated controversy due to its graphic imagery. She also performed at music festivals in the US and Europe to coincide with the album's release. During her promotion of the album, she became embroiled in a dispute with Lynn Hirschberg of ''[[The New York Times]]''.

English-Tamil musician M.I.A. (Mathangi "Maya" Arulpragasam) released her second album ''[[Kala (album)|Kala]]'' in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] in the United States and [[British Phonographic Industry|silver]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&amp;se=kala#search_section |title=Gold &amp; Platinum |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |date=5 March 2010 |accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx |title=Certified Awards |publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry]] |date=30 January 2009 |accessdate=28 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EEYfYVwc?url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx |archivedate=6 February 2013 }} ''Enter'' Kala ''in the field'' Search''.

Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown [[Rusko (musician)|Rusko]] grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules.&lt;ref name="NMEoff"&gt;{{cite journal|title='The new Justin Bieber video is more offensive than anything I've made...'|journal=[[NME]]|issn= 0028-6362|first=Jaimie|last=Hodgson|page=26|date=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diplo (DJ)|Diplo]] worked on the track "[[Tell Me Why (M.I.A. song)|Tell Me Why]]", but at a studio in [[Santa Monica]] rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because "her boyfriend really hates me".&lt;ref name="now" /&gt;

Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours.&lt;ref name="bbc6miarusk"/&gt; Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting "carried away" in the studio, appreciating the "mad distorted and hectic" sound they were able to create.&lt;ref name="bbc6miarusk"/&gt; Rusko said "She's got a kid, a little one year old baby, and we recorded his heart beat.

M.I.A. called the new project "schizophrenic", and spoke of the Internet inspiration that could be found in the songs and the artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/05/17/mia-pukes-out-schizophrenic-album-plots-fall-tour/|title=M.I.A. pukes out 'schizophrenic' album, plots fall tour|work=Rap-Up|accessdate=24 May 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521233044/http://www.rap-up.com/2010/05/17/mia-pukes-out-schizophrenic-album-plots-fall-tour/|archivedate=21 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also said that the album centred on her "not being able to leave [Los Angeles] for 18 months" and feeling "disconnected".&lt;ref name=discon&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/music/newsid_10080000/newsid_10087800/10087809.stm|title=M.I.A video 'removed by YouTube'|publisher=BBC|date=27 April 2010|accessdate=27 May 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430193511/http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/music/newsid_10080000/newsid_10087800/10087809.stm|archivedate=30 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She summed up the album's main theme as information politics. During the recording of the album, she spoke of the combined effects that news corporations and [[Google]] have on news and data collection, while stressing the need for alternative news sources that she felt her son's generation would need to ascertain truth.&lt;ref name="complexmia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/GIRLS/Cover-Girls/MIA?page=4|title=M.I.A.|last=Denver|first=Nate|date=24 May 2010|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=11 June 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601084531/http://www.complex.com/GIRLS/Cover-Girls/MIA?page=4|archivedate=1 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Maya'' was made to be "so uncomfortably weird and wrong that people begin to exercise their critical-thinking muscles". M.I.A. said "You can Google 'Sri Lanka' and it doesn't come up that all these people have been murdered or bombed, it's 'Come to Sri Lanka on vacation, there are beautiful beaches' ... you're not gonna get the truth till you hit like, page 56, and it's my and your responsibility to pass on the information that it's not easy anymore".&lt;ref name="complexmia"/&gt; Following these comments, M.I.A. received death threats directed at her and her son, which she also cited as an influence on the songs on the album. She summed up the album as a mixture of "babies, death, destruction and powerlessness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/2010/06/16/2010-06-16_mia_new_album_was_inspired_by_death_threats_to_my_son_ikhyd_after_i_criticized_s.html|title=M.I.A.: New album was inspired by death threats to my son, Ikhyd, after I criticized Sri Lanka|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|first=Anthony|last=Benigno|date=16 June 2010|accessdate=22 June 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619085106/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/2010/06/16/2010-06-16_mia_new_album_was_inspired_by_death_threats_to_my_son_ikhyd_after_i_criticized_s.html|archivedate=19 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The singer revealed that going into recording the album, she had still not accepted that she was a musician, saying "I'm still in denial, listening to too much [[Destiny's Child]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/m-i-a-s-global-party-the-futuristic-pop-star-on-her-decades-journey-20091229#ixzz1gXgx7iqM|first=Brian|last=Hiatt|title=M.I.A.'s Global Party: The Futuristic Pop Star on Her Decade's Journey|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=29 December 2009|accessdate=14 December 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202172656/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/m-i-a-s-global-party-the-futuristic-pop-star-on-her-decades-journey-20091229#ixzz1gXgx7iqM|archivedate=2 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With ''Maya'', she stated "I was happy being the retarded cousin of rap...
