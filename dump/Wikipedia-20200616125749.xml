The '''Nobel Prize in Physics''' is a yearly award given by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] for those who have made the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of [[physics]]. It is one of the five [[Nobel Prize]]s established by the will of [[Alfred Nobel]] in 1895 and awarded since 1901; the others being the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], [[Nobel Peace Prize]], and [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].

The first Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to physicist [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] in recognition of the extraordinary services he rendered by the discovery of [[X-ray]]s. This award is administered by the [[Nobel Foundation]] and is widely regarded as the most prestigious award that a scientist can receive in physics. It is presented in [[Stockholm]] at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death. Through 2019, a total of 212 individuals have been awarded the prize.&lt;ref name=nobelOrg&gt;{{cite web|title=All Nobel Prizes in Physics|website = Nobelprize.org| publisher =Nobel Media AB|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/|accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[Alfred Nobel]], in his last will and testament, stated that his wealth should be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the "greatest benefit on mankind" in the fields of [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[peace]], [[physiology]] or [[medicine]], and [[literature]].&lt;ref name="BBCHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/nobel_alfred.shtml |title=History – Historic Figures: Alfred Nobel (1833–1896) |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime, the last one was written a year before he died and was signed at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in [[Paris]] on 27 November 1895.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sohlman69|Ragnar Sohlman]]: 1983, Page 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The Nobel Foundation and its Role for Modern Day Science | publisher=Springer-Verlag | work=Die Naturwissenschaften | date=6 June 1981 | last=von Euler| first=U.S. | doi=10.1007/BF01047469 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets, 31&amp;nbsp;million [[Swedish krona|Swedish ''kronor'']] ([[USD|US]]$198 million, [[Euro]]€176 million in 2016), to establish and endow the five Nobel Prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/will/will-full.html | title=Nobel's will | publisher=Nobel.org | accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the level of skepticism surrounding the will, it was not until April 26, 1897 that it was approved by the [[Parliament of Norway|Storting]] (Norwegian Parliament).&lt;ref name="nobelprize1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobelfoundation/history/lemmel/index.html |title=The Nobel Foundation – History |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=2015-05-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109140259/http://nobelprize.org/nobelfoundation/history/lemmel/index.html |archivedate=January 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levinovitz13"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Agneta Wallin Levinovitz]]: 2001, Page 13&lt;/ref&gt; The executors of his will were [[Ragnar Sohlman]] and Rudolf Lilljequist, who formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel's fortune and organise the prizes.

The members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee who were to award the Peace Prize were appointed shortly after the will was approved. The prize-awarding organisations followed: the Karolinska Institutet on June 7, the Swedish Academy on June 9, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on June 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/nobel-prize-history.html |title=Nobel Prize History – |publisher=Infoplease.com |date=1999-10-13 |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/416852/Nobel-Foundation |title=Nobel Foundation (Scandinavian organisation) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nobel Foundation then reached an agreement on guidelines for how the Nobel Prize should be awarded. In 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]].&lt;ref name="Levinovitz13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=BritannicaWill&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/416856/Nobel-Prize "Nobel Prize]" (2007), in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', accessed 15 January 2009, from ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'': {{quote|After Nobel’s death, the Nobel Foundation was set up to carry out the provisions of his will and to administer his funds. In his will, he had stipulated that four different institutions—three Swedish and one Norwegian—should award the prizes. From Stockholm, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences confers the prizes for physics, chemistry, and economics, the Karolinska Institute confers the prize for physiology or medicine, and the Swedish Academy confers the prize for literature. The Norwegian Nobel Committee based in Oslo confers the prize for peace. The Nobel Foundation is the legal owner and functional administrator of the funds and serves as the joint administrative body of the prize-awarding institutions, but it is not concerned with the prize deliberations or decisions, which rest exclusively with the four institutions. }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nobel's will, The Royal Swedish Academy of sciences were to award the Prize in Physics.&lt;ref name=BritannicaWill /&gt;

== Nomination and selection ==
[[File:Portrait of Albert Einstein and Others (1879-1955), Physicist.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Three Nobel Laureates in Physics. Front row L-R: [[Albert Abraham Michelson|Albert A. Michelson]] (1907 prizewinner), [[Albert Einstein]] (1921 prizewinner) and [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Robert A. Millikan]] (1923 prizewinner).]]
A maximum of three [[Nobel laureate]]s and two different works may be selected for the Nobel Prize in Physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/ | title=Facts and figures | accessdate=May 4, 2015 | author=Nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://globaljournals.org/GJSFR_Volume13/3-On-the-Nobel-Prize-in-Physics-Controversies.pdf | title=GJSFR | accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with other Nobel Prizes, the nomination and selection process for the prize in Physics is long and rigorous. This is a key reason why it has grown in importance over the years to become the most important prize in Physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/416856/Nobel-Prize#toc93433 | title=The Nobel Prize Selection Process | publisher=Britannica Encyclopaedia | accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nobel laureates are selected by the [[Nobel Committee for Physics]], a [[Nobel Committee]] that consists of five members elected by [[The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. In the first stage that begins in September, around 3,000 people – selected university professors, Nobel Laureates in Physics and Chemistry, etc. – are sent confidential forms to nominate candidates. The completed nomination forms arrive at the Nobel Committee no later than 31 January of the following year. These nominees are scrutinized and discussed by experts who narrow it to approximately fifteen names. The committee submits a report with recommendations on the final candidates into the Academy, where, in the Physics Class, it is further discussed. The Academy then makes the final selection of the Laureates in Physics through a majority vote.&lt;ref name="Nomination"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nomination and Selection of Physics Laureates|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/physics/|website=nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB 2016|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The names of the nominees are never publicly announced, and neither are they told that they have been considered for the prize. Nomination records are sealed for fifty years.&lt;ref name="fiftyyearsrule"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nobelpeaceprize.org/en_GB/nomination_intro/nomination_secrecy/ | title=50 year secrecy rule | accessdate=May 6, 2015 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501054903/http://nobelpeaceprize.org/en_GB/nomination_intro/nomination_secrecy/ | archivedate=May 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While posthumous nominations are not permitted, awards can be made if the individual died in the months between the decision of the prize committee (typically in October) and the ceremony in December. Prior to 1974, posthumous awards were permitted if the recipient had died after being nominated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelfoundation/statutes.html#par4 | title=About posthumous awards | accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules for the Nobel Prize in Physics require that the significance of achievements being recognized has been "tested by time". In practice, it means that the lag between the discovery and the award is typically on the order of 20 years and can be much longer. For example, half of the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] for his work on stellar structure and evolution that was done during the 1930s. As a downside of this tested-by-time rule, not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognized. Some important scientific discoveries are never considered for a prize, as the discoverers die by the time the impact of their work is appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11192-009-0035-9 |title=Why it has become more difficult to predict Nobel Prize winners: A bibliometric analysis of nominees and winners of the chemistry and physics prizes (1901–2007) |date=2009 |last1=Gingras |first1=Yves |last2=Wallace |first2=Matthew L. |journal=Scientometrics |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=401|arxiv=0808.2517 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature Chemistry |doi=10.1038/nchem.372|bibcode = 2009NatCh...1..509.|title=A noble prize|date=2009|volume=1|issue=7|pages=509|pmid=21378920 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medals ===
The Nobel Prize medals, minted by [[Myntverket]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Medalj – ett traditionellt hantverk | publisher = Myntverket | url = http://www.myntverket.se/products.asp?lang=sv&amp;page=3 | language = Swedish | accessdate = 2007-12-15 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071218102934/http://www.myntverket.se/products.asp?lang%3Dsv%26page%3D3 &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; | archivedate = 2007-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Sweden and the Mint of Norway since 1902, are registered trademarks of the Nobel Foundation. Each medal has an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse. The Nobel Prize medals for Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, and Literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death (1833–1896). Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Nobel Peace Prize medal and the Medal for the Prize in Economics, but with a slightly different design.&lt;ref name=PaulingPeacePrize&gt;[http://digitalcollections.library.oregonstate.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/pawardsmedals&amp;CISOPTR=47 "The Nobel Prize for Peace"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916090914/http://digitalcollections.library.oregonstate.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=%2Fpawardsmedals&amp;CISOPTR=47 |date=2009-09-16 }}, "Linus Pauling: Awards, Honors, and Medals", ''Linus Pauling and The Nature of the Chemical Bond: A Documentary History'', the [[The Valley Library|Valley Library]], [[Oregon State University]]. Retrieved 7 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thenobelmedals"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/medals/ | title=The Medals | accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize. The reverse sides of the Nobel Prize medals for Chemistry and Physics share the same design of Nature, as a Goddess, whose veil is held up by the Genius of Science. These medals, along with those for Physiology/Medicine and Literature, were designed by Erik Lindberg in 1902.&lt;ref name="Nobel Prize for Physics and Chemistry"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/medal.html|title=The Nobel Prize for Physics and Chemistry|access-date=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diplomas ===
[[File:Nobel Pierre et Marie Curie 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|1903 Nobel Prize diploma, awarded to [[Marie Curie]] and [[Pierre Curie]]]]
Nobel laureates receive a diploma directly from the hands of the King of Sweden. Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureate who receives it.&lt;ref name="nobelprize5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/diplomas/|title=The Nobel Prize Diplomas |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diploma contains a picture and text which states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize.&lt;ref name="nobelprize5" /&gt;

=== Award money ===
At the awards ceremony, the laureate is given a document indicating the award sum. The amount of the cash award may differ from year to year, based on the funding available from the [[Nobel Foundation]]. For example, in 2009 the total cash awarded was 10 million SEK (US$1.4 million),&lt;ref name="nobelprize2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/amounts/ |title=The Nobel Prize Amounts |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2012, the amount was 8 million [[Swedish Krona|Swedish Kronor]], or US$1.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-06-11/world/world_europe_nobel-prize-cut_1_nobel-prize-nobel-foundation-alfred-nobel?_s=PM:EUROPE|title=Nobel prize amounts to be cut 20% in 2012|publisher=CNN|date=2012-06-11|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709002611/http://articles.cnn.com/2012-06-11/world/world_europe_nobel-prize-cut_1_nobel-prize-nobel-foundation-alfred-nobel?_s=PM:EUROPE|archivedate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there are two laureates in a particular category, the award grant is divided equally between the recipients, but if there are three, the awarding committee may opt to divide the grant equally, or award half to one recipient and a quarter to each of the two others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/oct/05/nobel-prize-medicine-2009-award|title=Nobel prize for medicine shared by scientists for work on ageing and cancer &amp;#124; Science &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk|newspaper=Guardian |date= 2009-10-05|accessdate=2010-01-15 | location=London | first=Ian | last=Sample}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ian Sample, Science correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/oct/07/physics.nobel |title=Three share Nobel prize for physics &amp;#124; Science &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |newspaper=Guardian |date= 2008-10-07|accessdate=2010-02-10 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Landes|url=http://www.thelocal.se/22604/20091012/ |title=Americans claim Nobel economics prize – The Local |publisher=Thelocal.se |date=|accessdate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2009/press.html |title=The 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics – Press Release |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ceremony ===
The committee and institution serving as the selection board for the prize typically announce the names of the laureates in October. The prize is then awarded at formal ceremonies held annually in [[Stockholm Concert Hall]] on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death. The laureates receive a diploma, a medal and a document confirming the prize amount.&lt;ref name="awardceremony"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/ceremonies/archive/history/index.html | title=Nobel prize award ceremony | accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
