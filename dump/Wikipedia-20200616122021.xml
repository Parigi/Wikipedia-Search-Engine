==Historical people and events==
===''Commodus: Reign of Blood''===

*[[Commodus]] was Roman Emperor from 180 to 192. He also ruled as co-emperor with his father Marcus Aurelius from 177 until his father's death in 180.
*[[Marcus Aurelius]] was Roman Emperor from 161 to 180. He ruled with [[Lucius Verus]] as co-emperor from 161 until Verus' death in 169. Marcus Aurelius was the last of the so-called [[Five Good Emperors]]. He was a practitioner of [[Stoicism]], and his Greek-language writing, commonly known as the ''[[Meditations]]'', is the most significant source of the modern understanding of ancient Stoic philosophy.
*[[Faustina the Younger]] was a daughter of ''Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius.'' She was a Roman Empress and wife to her maternal cousin Marcus Aurelius. Though Roman sources give a generally negative view of her character, she was held in high esteem by soldiers and her own husband and was given divine honors after her death.
*[[Lucilla]] was the second daughter and third child of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius and an elder sister to future Roman Emperor Commodus.
*[[Avidius Cassius]] was a Roman general and usurper who briefly ruled Egypt and Syria in 175.

===''Julius Caesar: Master of Rome''===

*[[Julius Caesar]], a politician, general, and later, dictator; the season's central argument is that Julius Caesar was assassinated because wealthy and conservative elites wanted to block Caesar's reforms.
*[[Pompey]], politician and military leader who, while as ambitious as Caesar, and despite having been his son-in-law, chose to ally himself with the optimates in opposing Caesar and supporting the traditional Roman Republic.
*[[Crassus]], the richest man in Rome, who rose to political prominence following his victory over the [[Third Servile War|slave revolt]] led by [[Spartacus]], sharing the consulship with his rival Pompey 
*[[Servilia (mother of Brutus)|Servilia]], the mother of Marcus Junius Brutus and former lover of Caesar
*[[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]], a Roman politician whose relationship with Caesar is deeply complex
*[[Mark Antony]], an [[hedonistic]] Roman general and politician; while Caesar was away in Egypt, Antony remained in Rome to restore order but quickly caused Rome to fall into a state of anarchy.
