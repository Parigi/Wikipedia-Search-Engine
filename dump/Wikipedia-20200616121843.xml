'''Ninety Six National Historic Site''', also known as '''Old Ninety Six and Star Fort''', is a United States [[National Historic Sites (United States)|National Historic Site]] located about 60 miles (96 kilometers) south of [[Greenville, South Carolina]]. The historic site was listed on the National Register in 1969,&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; declared to be a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1973,&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt; and established as a [[National Historic Sites (United States)|National Historic Site]] in 1976 to preserve the original site of [[Ninety Six, South Carolina]], a small town established in the early 18th century. It encompasses 1,022 acres of property.

==History==
The most common proposed etymology of the [[toponym]] Ninety Six is a reference to the distance in miles between the location and the Cherokee town of [[Keowee]]. Supporters of such an etymology have to struggle with the fact that the distance between the two locales is 78 miles. David P. George, Jr., has advanced the alternate hypothesis that Ninety Six is a reinterpretation of "the nine and six," a reference to two sets of southerly flowing streams—nine tributaries of [http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:3:::NO::P3_FID:1224312 Marion] and [http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:3:::NO::P3_FID:1229788 Henley] creeks and six tributaries of [http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:3:::NO::P3_FID:1230410 Thompsons Creek]—in an area in which the [[Saluda River]] tends to be fed by north and easterly flowing streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |issn=0038-3082 |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=69–84 |last=George |first=David.

===Revolutionary War===
[[File:starfortbattlefield.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sunset over the battlefield at Star Fort.]]

Ninety Six had become a prosperous village of about 100 settlers by the time of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The [[Siege of Savage's Old Fields|first land battle]] ([[Siege of Savage's Old Fields]]) of the war fought in South Carolina took place at Ninety Six on November 19–21, 1775; then major [[Andrew Williamson (soldier)|Andrew Williamson]] of the Ninety-Six District Regiment of militia tried to recapture ammunition and gunpowder taken by Loyalists; outnumbered, he finally reached a truce with them.&lt;ref name="toulmin"&gt;LLEWELLYN M. TOULMIN, "Backcountry Warrior: Brig. Gen. Andrew Williamson", ''Journal of Backcountry Studies'', Vol. 7 No.1, Spring 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Lewis'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carolana.com/SC/Revolution/revolution_ninety_six_1775.html|title=The American Revolution in South Carolina, Ninety-Six|author=Lewis, J.D.|accessdate=March 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village became a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] stronghold early in the war, though the backcountry of the Carolinas was populated both by those loyal to crown and by partisans.  The latter were often of Scots-Irish descent, though there were loyalist Scots as well as migrants of other origins.  Ninety Six was fortified by the [[British Army|British]] in 1780, as they considered this a strategic location. From May 22 - June 18, 1781,  newly appointed Southern Department commander of the [[Continental Army]], [[Major General]] [[Nathanael Greene]] led 1,000 troops in a [[Siege of Ninety Six|siege]] against the 550 Loyalists defending the fort in the village. The 28-day [[Siege of Ninety Six|siege]] centered on an earthen [[star fort]]. Despite having more troops, Greene's [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriots]] did not succeed in taking the town.

Ninety Six was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: |url={{NHLS url|id=69000169}} |format=pdf|year=1969 |author=Janson L.

According to the South Carolina Department of Archives and History, the "historic district of Ninety Six National Historic Site contains numerous historical features."&lt;ref name="scdahsum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/greenwood/S10817724001/index.htm

A special ceremony was held the weekend of May 20, 2006 to commemorate the 225th anniversary of the Battle of Star Fort.

==The site today==
The 1,022-acre Ninety Six National Historic Site is located two miles (3.2 kilometers) south of the present-day town of Ninety Six on South Carolina Highway 248. The [[National Park Service]] maintains a visitor center that includes a small museum containing artifacts found at the site, as well as other period artifacts, and oil paintings of the battle and local leaders of the American Revolution. A video about the battle is available, and there is also a gift shop.  Visitors can rent a self-guided audio tour of the park.

A one-mile (1.6 kilometer) interpretive trail begins at the visitor center and takes visitors to the remains of Star Fort as well as the original site of Ninety Six.  Additional off-road trails weaving through the woods lead to Star Fort Pond, an old unidentified cemetery (believed to be a slave cemetery from post-colonial times), and to the graves of Major James Gouedy, a trader influential in the founding of Ninety Six, and Major James Mayson, who captured a significant gunpowder cache to be used by the Americans.
