'''Francoist Spain''' ({{lang-es|España franquista}}), known in Spain as the '''Francoist dictatorship''' ({{lang-es|dictadura franquista}}), officially known as the '''Spanish State''' ({{lang-es|Estado Español}}), is the period of [[history of Spain|Spanish history]] between 1936 and 1975, when [[Francisco Franco]] ruled Spain as dictator with the title ''[[Caudillo]]''.

The nature of the regime evolved and changed during its existence. Months after the start of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in July 1936, Franco emerged as the dominant rebel military leader and was proclaimed Head of State on 1 October 1936, ruling a [[dictatorship]] over the territory controlled by the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist faction]]. The [[Unification Decree (Spain, 1937)|1937 Unification Decree]], which merged all parties supporting the rebel side, led to Nationalist Spain becoming a single-party regime under the [[FET y de las JONS]]. The end of the war in 1939 brought the extension of the Franco rule to the whole country and the [[Spanish Republican government in exile|exile of Republican institutions]]. The Francoist dictatorship originally took a form described as "fascistized dictatorship",{{Sfn|Saz Campos|2004|p=90}} or "semi-fascist regime",&lt;ref name=payne /&gt; showing clear influence of [[fascism]] in fields such as [[Spanish Labour Organization|labor relations]], the [[autarky|autarkic]] [[Economic history of Spain#The Franco Era, 1939–75|economic policy]], [[Symbols of Francoism|aesthetics]], or the [[one party system|single-party system]].{{Sfn|Moradiellos|2000|p=20}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvsp|Cabrera|Rey|2017}}; Capítulo V&lt;/ref&gt; As time went on, the regime opened up and became closer to developmental dictatorships, although it always preserved residual fascist trappings.&lt;ref&gt;«La ausencia de un ideario definido le permitió transitar de unas fórmulas dictatoriales a otras, rozando el fascismo en los cuarenta y a las dictaduras desarrollistas en los sesenta».{{harvnb|Tusell|1999}}, cap. «El franquismo como dictadura».&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=payne&gt;«La tesis defendida por Payne en dicho dossier puede sintetizarse con estas palabras:
{{cita|Entre 1937 y 1943, el franquismo constituyó un régimen "semi-fascista", pero nunca un régimen fascista cien por cien. Después pasó treinta y dos años evolucionando como un sistema autoritario "posfascista", aunque no consiguió eliminar completamente todos los vestigios residuales del fascismo.}}» [https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5263342 Glicerio Sanchez Recio. ''En torno a la Dictadura franquista'' Hispania Nova]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Spain did not join the [[Axis powers]] (its supporters from the civil war, [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]). Nevertheless, Spain supported them in various ways throughout most of the war while maintaining its neutrality. Because of this, Spain was [[Pariah state|isolated]] by many other countries for nearly a decade after World War II, while its [[autarky|autarkic]] economy, still trying to recover from the civil war, suffered from chronic depression. The [[Law of Succession to the Headship of the State|1947 Law of Succession]] made Spain a ''de jure'' Kingdom again, but defined Franco as the Head of State for life with the power to choose the person to become [[King of Spain]] and his successor.

Reforms were implemented in the 1950s and Spain abandoned autarky, reassigned authority from the [[Falangism|Falangist movement]], which had been prone to isolationism, to a new breed of economists, the [[Technocracy|technocrats]] of [[Opus Dei and politics#Opus Dei members in Franco's government|Opus Dei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/timreuter/2014/05/19/before-chinas-transformation-there-was-the-spanish-miracle/#f5da6133b3e1 | title= Before China's Transformation, There Was The 'Spanish Miracle'| work=Forbes Magazine | access-date=22 August 2017 | date=19 May 2014 | first=Tim | last=Reuter}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to massive economic growth, second only to [[Japanese economic miracle|Japan]], that lasted until the mid-1970s, known as the "[[Spanish miracle]]". During the 1950s the regime also changed from being openly totalitarian and using severe repression to an authoritarian system with limited pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Payne2000|Payne (2000)]], p. 645&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these reforms, Spain was allowed to join the [[United Nations]] in 1955 and during the [[Cold War]] Franco was one of Europe's foremost [[anti-communist]] figures: his regime was assisted by the [[First World|Western powers]], particularly the [[United States]], and it was asked to join [[NATO]]. [[Francisco Franco#Death and funeral|Franco died in 1975]] at the age of 82. He restored the monarchy before his death and made his successor [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos I]], who would lead the [[Spanish transition to democracy]].

==Establishment==
{{See also|Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)}}
On 1 October 1936, Franco was formally recognised as [[Caudillo|Caudillo of Spain]]—the Spanish equivalent of the Italian [[Duce]] and the German [[Führer]]—by the ''Junta de Defensa Nacional'' (National Defense Council), which governed the territories occupied by the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Preston, Chapter 6 "The Making of a Caudillo" in ''Franco: A Biography'' (1993), pp.&amp;nbsp;171–198&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1937, Franco assumed control of the ''[[Falange Española de las JONS]]'', then led by [[Manuel Hedilla]], who had succeeded [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]], who was executed in November 1936 by the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican government]]. He merged it with the [[Carlism|Carlist]] ''Comunión Tradicionalista'' to form the ''[[Falange|Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS]]'', the sole legal party of Francoist Spain, it was the main component of the ''[[Movimiento Nacional]]'' (National Movement).&lt;ref&gt;Preston (1993), Chapter 10. "The Making of a Dictator: Franco and the Unification April 1937", pp.&amp;nbsp;248–274&lt;/ref&gt; The Falangists were concentrated at local government and grassroot level, entrusted with harnessing the Civil War's momentum of mass mobilisation through their auxiliaries and trade unions by collecting denunciations of enemy residents and recruiting workers into the trade unions.&lt;ref&gt;Ángela Cenarro Lagunas, "Historia y Memoria del Auxilio Social de Falange" in ''Pliegos de Juste'' 11–12 (2010), pp.&amp;nbsp;71–74&lt;/ref&gt; While there were prominent Falangists at a senior government level, especially before the late 1940s, there were higher concentrations of monarchists, military officials and other traditional conservative factions at those levels.&lt;!-- will be provided --&gt;{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} However, the Falange remained the sole party.

The Francoists took control of Spain through a comprehensive and methodical war of attrition (''guerra de desgaste'') which involved the imprisonment and executions of Spaniards found guilty of supporting the values promoted by the Republic: regional autonomy, liberal or social democracy, free elections and women's rights, including the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Graham, "The memory of murder: mass killing, incarceration and the making of Francoism" in ''War Memories, Memory Wars. Political Violence in Twentieth-Century Spain''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franco's description: "The work of pacification and moral redemption must necessarily be undertaken slowly and methodically, otherwise military occupation will serve no purpose". Roberto Cantalupo, ''Fu la Spagna: Ambasciata presso Franco: de la guerra civil'', Madrid, 1999: pp. 206–208.&lt;/ref&gt; The right-wing considered these "enemy elements" to comprise an "anti-Spain" that was the product of [[Bolsheviks]] and a "[[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Judeo-Masonic conspiracy]]", which had evolved after the ''[[Reconquista]]'' of the Iberian Peninsula from the Islamic [[Moors]], a Reconquista that had been declared formally over with the [[Alhambra Decree]] of 1492 expelling the Jews from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Alejandro Quiroga, ''Making Spaniards'', p. 58. Palgrave, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the Spanish Civil War, according to the regime's own figures there were more than {{formatnum:270000}} men and women held in prisons and some {{formatnum:500000}} had fled into exile. Large numbers of those captured were returned to Spain or interned in [[Nazi concentration camps]] as stateless enemies. Between six and seven thousand exiles from Spain died in [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]]. It has been estimated that more than {{formatnum:200000}} Spaniards died in the first years of the dictatorship from 1940 to 1942 as a result of political persecution, hunger and disease related to the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;''The Splintering of Spain'', pp.&amp;nbsp;2–3 Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-82178-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain's strong ties with the [[Axis powers|Axis]] resulted in its international ostracism in the early years following [[World War II]] as Spain was not a founding member of the [[United Nations]] and did not become a member until 1955.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Member states of the United Nations]].&lt;/ref&gt; This changed with the [[Cold War]] that soon followed the end of hostilities in 1945, in the face of which Franco's strong [[anti-communism]] naturally tilted its regime to ally with the [[United States]]. Independent political parties and trade unions were banned throughout the duration of the dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;''The Splintering of Spain'', p. 4. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, once decrees for economic stabilisation were put forth by the late 1950s, the way was opened for massive foreign investment—"a watershed in post-war economic, social and ideological normalisation leading to extraordinarily rapid economic growth"—that marked Spain's "participation in the Europe-wide post-war economic normality centred on mass consumption and consensus, in contrast to the concurrent reality of the Soviet bloc".&lt;ref&gt;''The Splintering of Spain'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 1947, Spain was declared a kingdom, but no monarch was designated until in 1969 Franco established [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos of Bourbon]] as his official heir-apparent. Franco was to be succeeded by [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] as Prime Minister with the intention of continuing the Francoist regime, but those hopes ended with his [[Assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco|1973 assassination]] by the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] separatist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]. With the death of Franco on 20 November 1975, Juan Carlos became the [[King of Spain]]. He initiated the country's subsequent [[Spanish transition to democracy|transition to democracy]], ending with Spain becoming a [[constitutional monarchy]] with an [[parliamentary democracy|elected parliament]] and autonomous devolved governments.

==Government==
{{see|Movimiento Nacional}}

After Franco's victory in 1939, the Falange was declared the sole legally sanctioned political party in Spain and it asserted itself as the main component of the National Movement. In a [[state of emergency]]-like status, Franco ruled with, on paper, more power than any Spanish leader before or since. He was not even required to consult his cabinet for most legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, p. 231-234&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Stanley G. Payne]], Franco had more day-to-day power than [[Adolf Hitler]] or [[Joseph Stalin]] possessed at the respective heights of their power. Payne noted that Hitler and Stalin at least maintained rubber-stamp parliaments, while Franco dispensed with even that formality in the early years of his rule. According to Payne, the lack of even a rubber-stamp parliament made Franco's government "the most purely arbitrary in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Payne, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; The 100-member [[National Council of the Movement]] served as a makeshift legislature until the passing of the [[Organic law|organic law of 1942]] and the ''Ley Constitutiva de las Cortes'' (Constituent Law of the Cortes) the same year, which saw the grand opening of the [[Cortes Españolas]] on 18 July 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|e02yoA0vFwI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Organic Law made the government ultimately responsible for passing all laws,&lt;ref name="countrystudies.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/spain/22.htm|title=Spain - THE FRANCO YEARS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while defining the Cortes as a purely advisory body elected by neither direct nor universal suffrage. The Cortes had no power over government spending, and the government was not responsible to it; ministers were appointed and dismissed by Franco alone as the "Chief" of state and government. The ''Ley del Referendum Nacional'' (Law of the National Referendum), passed in 1945 approved for all "fundamental laws" to be approved by a popular referendum, in which only the heads of families could vote. Local municipal councils were appointed similarly by heads of families and local corporations through [[Municipal electoral regime during Francoism|local municipal elections]] while mayors were appointed by the government. It was thus one of the most centralised countries in Europe and certainly the most centralised in Western Europe following the fall of the Portuguese ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' in the [[Carnation Revolution]].

The referendum law was used twice during Franco's rule—in 1947, when a [[Spanish law of succession referendum, 1947|referendum revived the Spanish monarchy]] with Franco as ''de facto'' regent for life with sole right to appoint his successor; and in 1966, another [[Spanish organic law referendum, 1966|referendum]] was held to approve a new "[[Organic Law of the State|organic law]]", or constitution, supposedly limiting and clearly defining Franco's powers as well as formally creating the modern office of [[Prime Minister of Spain]]. By delaying the issue of republic versus monarchy for his 36-year dictatorship and by refusing to take up the throne himself in 1947, Franco sought to antagonise neither the monarchical Carlists (who preferred the restoration of a Bourbon) nor the republican "old shirts" (original Falangists). Franco ignored the claim to the throne of [[Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona]], son of the last king, [[Alfonso XIII]], who designated him as his heir; Franco found him too liberal. In 1961, Franco offered [[Otto von Habsburg]] the throne, but was refused and ultimately followed Otto's recommendation by selecting in 1969 the young [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos of Bourbon]], son of Infante Juan, as his officially designated heir to the throne, shortly after his 30th birthday (the minimum age required under the Law of Succession).

In 1973, due to old age and to lessen his burdens in governing Spain he resigned as Prime Minister and named Navy Admiral [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] to the said post, but Franco remained as the Chief of State, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and ''Jefe del Movimiento'' (Chief of the Movement). However, Carrero Blanco was assassinated in the same year and [[Carlos Arias Navarro]] became the country's new Prime Minister.

==Armed forces==
During the first year of peace, Franco dramatically reduced the size of the [[Spanish Army]]—from almost one million at the end of the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] to {{formatnum:250000}} in early 1940, with most soldiers two-year conscripts.&lt;ref name="Bowen and Álvarez"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|pages=114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qY94qFszWq8C&amp;pg=PA13|isbn=978-0-275-99357-3|last=Bowen|first=Wayne H.|author2=José E. Álvarez|title=A Military History of Modern Spain|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about the international situation, Spain's possible entry into [[World War II]] and threats of invasion led him to undo some of these reductions. In November 1942, with the [[Operation Torch|Allied landings in North Africa]] and the [[Case Anton|German occupation of France]] bringing hostilities closer than ever to Spain's border, Franco ordered a partial mobilization, bringing the army to over {{formatnum:750000}} men.&lt;ref name="Bowen and Álvarez"/&gt; The [[Spanish Air Force|Air Force]] and [[Spanish Navy|Navy]] also grew in numbers and in budgets to {{formatnum:35000}} airmen and {{formatnum:25000}} sailors by 1945, although for fiscal reasons Franco had to restrain attempts by both services to undertake dramatic expansions.&lt;ref name="Bowen and Álvarez"/&gt; The army maintained a strength of about {{formatnum:400000}} men until the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name="Payne2"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=University of Wisconsin Pres|pages=244|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6Ie_HYgjUwC&amp;pg=PA244|isbn=978-0-299-11074-1|last=Payne|first=Stanley G.|title=The Franco Regime, 1936–1975|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial empire and decolonisation==
{{Further|Spanish Empire}}
Spain attempted to retain control of the last remnants of its colonial empire throughout Franco's rule. During the [[Algerian War]] (1954–1962), Madrid became the base of the ''[[Organisation armée secrète]]'' right-wing French Army group which sought to preserve [[French rule in Algeria|French Algeria]]. Despite this, Franco was forced to make some concessions. When the [[French protectorate in Morocco]] became independent in 1956, Spain surrendered its [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco]] to [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]], retaining only a few exclaves, the ''[[Plazas de soberanía]]''. The year after, Mohammed V invaded [[Spanish Sahara]] during the [[Ifni War]] (known as the "Forgotten War" in Spain). Only in 1975, with the [[Green March]] and the military occupation, did Morocco take control of all of the former Spanish territories in the Sahara.

In 1968, under [[United Nations]] pressure Franco granted Spain's colony of [[Equatorial Guinea]] its independence and the next year ceded the exclave of [[Ifni]] to [[Morocco]]. Under Franco, Spain also pursued a campaign to gain sovereignty of the British overseas territory of [[Gibraltar]] and closed its border in 1969. The border would not be fully reopened until 1985.

==Francoism==

The consistent points in Francoism included above all [[authoritarianism]], [[Spanish nationalism]], [[national Catholicism]], [[monarchism]], [[militarism]], [[national conservatism]], [[anti-Masonry]], [[anti-Catalanism]], [[Panhispanism|pan-Hispanism]] and [[anti-liberalism]]—some authors also include [[integralism]].&lt;ref&gt;Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p 31, and Paul Preston, "The Theorists of extermination" essay in ''Unearthing Franco's Legacy'',  pp&amp;nbsp;42–67 University of Notre Dame Press {{ISBN|0-268-03268-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/fundamentalismin00lawr_0|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/fundamentalismin00lawr_0/page/87 87]|quote=franco integralism.|title=Fundamentalism in Comparative Perspective|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|isbn=0870237985|last1=Kaplan|first1=Lawrence|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Payne]], a scholar of Spain notes that "scarcely any of the serious historians and analysts of Franco consider the ''generalissimo'' to be a core fascist".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Payne, Stanley [https://archive.org/details/fascisminspain1900payn ''Fascism in Spain, 1923–1977''], p. 476 1999 Univ. of Wisconsin Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter [https://books.google.com/books?id=fWggQTqioXcC&amp;dq ''Fascism: Past, Present, Future''], p. 13, 1997 Oxford University Press US&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Walter Laqueur]] "during the Civil War, Spanish fascists were forced to subordinate their activities to the nationalist cause. At the helm were military leaders such as General Francisco Franco, who were conservatives in all essential respects. When the civil war ended, Franco was so deeply entrenched that the Falange stood no chance; in this strongly authoritarian regime, there was no room for political opposition. The Falange became junior partners in the government and, as such, they had to accept responsibility for the regime's policy without being able to shape it substantially".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;id=fWggQTqioXcC&amp;q=spanish+fascism#v=snippet&amp;q=spanish%20fascism&amp;f=false ''Fascism: Past, Present, Future''.] Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Security Council]] voted in 1946 to deny the Franco regime recognition until it developed a more representative government.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Burleigh]], ''Sacred Causes'', p. 316, 2006, HarperPress, {{ISBN|0-00-719574-5}}; see also [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 7]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
The [[Falange Española de las JONS]], a fascist party formed during the Republic, soon transformed itself into the framework of reference in the National Movement. In April 1937, the ''Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista'' (Traditionalist Spanish Phalanx and of the Councils of National Syndicalist Offensive) was created from the absorption of the [[Traditionalist Communion|''Comunión Tradicionalista'']] (Traditionalist Communion) by the ''Falange Española de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista'', which itself was the result of an earlier absorption of the ''[[Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista]]'' by José Antonio Primo de Rivera's ''Falange Española''. This party, often referred to as Falange, became the sole legal party during Franco's regime, but the term "party" was generally avoided, especially after World War II, when it was commonly referred to as the "National Movement" or just as "the Movement".

===Authoritarianism===
The main point of those scholars that tend to consider the Spanish State to be authoritarian rather than fascist is that the FET-JONS were relatively heterogeneous rather than being an ideological monolith.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Franco and the Spanish Civil War"&gt;De Menses, Filipe Ribeiro [https://books.google.com/books?id=InPG_1wKfCIC&amp;dq Franco and the Spanish Civil War], p. 87, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Gilmour, David, [https://archive.org/details/transformationof00gilm The Transformation of Spain: From Franco to the Constitutional Monarchy], p. 7 1985 Quartet Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fascism in Spain, 1923–1977"&gt;Payne, Stanley [https://archive.org/details/fascisminspain1900payn Fascism in Spain, 1923–1977], p. 347, 476 1999 Univ. of Wisconsin Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fascism: Past, Present, Future"&gt;Laqueur, Walter [https://books.google.com/books?id=fWggQTqioXcC&amp;dq Fascism: Past, Present, Future] p. 13 1996 Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], the Falange opposed free capital markets, but the ultimately prevailing [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]], some of whom were linked with [[Opus Dei]], eschewed syndicalist economics and favoured increased competition as a means of achieving rapid economic growth and integration with wider [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Franco Years: Policies, Programs, and Growing Popular Unrest." ''A Country Study: Spain'' &lt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html#es0034&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish State was authoritarian: Non-government [[trade union]]s and all political opponents across the [[political spectrum]] were either suppressed or controlled by all means, including police repression.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Most country towns and rural areas were patrolled by pairs of ''[[Civil Guard (Spain)|Guardia Civil]]'', a military police for civilians, which functioned as a chief means of social control. Larger cities, and capitals, were mostly under the heavily armed ''[[Armed Police Corps|Policía Armada]]'', commonly called ''grises'' due to their grey uniforms. Franco was also the focus of a [[personality cult]], which taught that he had been sent by [[Divine Providence]] to save the country from chaos and poverty.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Members of the oppressed ranged from Catholic trade unions to [[communism|communist]] and [[anarchism|anarchist]] organisations to [[liberal democracy|liberal democrats]] and [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan]] or [[Basque nationalism|Basque]] separatists. The ''[[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]]'' (CNT) and the ''[[Unión General de Trabajadores]]'' (UGT) trade unions were outlawed and replaced in 1940 by the corporatist ''[[Spanish Labour Organization|Sindicato Vertical]]''. The [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) and the ''[[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]]'' (ERC) party were banned in 1939 while the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] (PCE) went underground. University students seeking democracy revolted in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which was repressed by the ''grises''. The [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV) went into exile and in 1959 the armed separatist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] was created to wage a [[low-intensity warfare|low-intensity war]] against Franco. Like others at the time, Franco evinced a concern about a possible [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] and [[List of conspiracy theories|Judaic conspiracy]] against his regime.

Franco continued to personally sign all death warrants until [[Last use of capital punishment in Spain|just months before he died]] despite international campaigns requesting him to desist.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Spanish nationalism===
[[File:Francoist demonstration in Salamanca.jpg|thumb|Francoist demonstration in [[Salamanca]] in 1937]]
Franco's Spanish nationalism promoted a unitary national identity by repressing Spain's cultural diversity. [[Bullfighting]] and [[flamenco]]&lt;ref&gt;Roman, Mar. "Spain frets over future of flamenco." 27 October 2007. Associated Press. [https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071027/ap_en_mu/flamenco_for_foreigners]&lt;/ref&gt; were promoted as national traditions, while those traditions not considered Spanish were suppressed. Franco's view of Spanish tradition was somewhat artificial and arbitrary: while some regional traditions were suppressed, Flamenco, an [[Andalusia]]n tradition, was considered part of a larger, national identity. All cultural activities were subject to [[censorship]] and many were forbidden entirely, often in an erratic manner. This cultural policy relaxed over time, most notably in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Franco was reluctant to enact any form of administrative and legislative decentralisation and kept a fully centralised form of government with a similar administrative structure to that established by the [[House of Bourbon]] and General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]. These structures were modelled after the centralised French state. As a result of this type of governance, government attention and initiatives were irregular and often depended more on the goodwill of government representatives than on regional needs. Thus inequalities in schooling, health care or transport facilities among regions were patent: historically affluent regions like [[Madrid]], [[Catalonia]] or the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] fared much better than others such as [[Extremadura]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] or [[Andalusia]].

[[Francisco Franco|Franco]] eliminated the autonomy granted by the [[Second Spanish Republic]] to the regions and abolished the centuries-old fiscal privileges and autonomy (the [[fueros]]) in two of the three Basque provinces: [[Gipuzkoa|Guipuzcoa]] and [[Biscay]], which were officially classified as "traitor regions". The fueros were kept in the third Basque province, [[Alava]], and also in [[Navarre]], a former kingdom during the Middle Ages and the cradle of the Carlists, possibly due to the region's support during the Civil War.

[[Francisco Franco|Franco]] also used [[Language politics in Spain under Franco|language politics]] in an attempt to establish national homogeneity. Despite Franco himself being Galician, the government revoked the official statute and recognition for the [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] languages that the Republic had granted them for the first time in the history of Spain. The former policy of promoting [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as the only official language of the state and education was resumed, even though millions of the country's citizens spoke other languages. The legal usage of languages other than Spanish was forbidden: all government, notarial, legal and commercial documents were to be drawn up exclusively in Spanish and any written in other languages were deemed null and void. The use of any other language was forbidden in schools, advertising, religious ceremonies and on road and shop signs. Publications in other languages were generally forbidden, though citizens continued to use them privately. During the late 1960s, these policies became more lenient yet non-Castilian languages continued to be discouraged and did not receive official status or legal recognition. Additionally, the popularisation of the compulsory national educational system and the development of modern mass media, both controlled by the state and exclusively in Spanish, reduced the competency of speakers of Basque, Catalan and Galician.

===Roman Catholicism===
Although Franco himself was previously known for not being very devout,&lt;ref&gt;Viñas, Á. (2012). En el combate por la historia: la República, la guerra civil, el franquismo.&lt;/ref&gt; his regime often used religion as a means to increase its popularity throughout the Catholic world, especially after the Second World War. Franco himself was increasingly portrayed as a fervent Catholic and a staunch defender of Roman Catholicism, the declared state religion. The regime favoured very conservative Roman Catholicism and it reversed the secularisation process that had taken place under the Republic. According to historian [[Julián Casanova Ruiz|Julian Casanova]], "the symbiosis of religion, fatherland and Caudillo" saw the Church assume great political responsibilities, "a hegemony and monopoly beyond its wildest dreams" and it played "a central role in policing the country's citizens".&lt;ref&gt;Julian Casanova, Professor of Contemporary History at the University of Zaragoza, ''The Faces of Terror'', in Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Francisco Franco en la iglesia de Santa María durante la celebración de la Salve (5 de 9) - Fondo Car-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|Franco with Catholic Church dignitaries in 1946]]
The [[Law of Political Responsibility]] of February 1939 turned the Church into an extralegal body of investigation as parishes were granted policing powers equal to those of local government officials and leaders of the Falange. Some official jobs required a "good behaviour" statement by a priest. According to historian Julian Casanova, "the reports that have survived reveal a clergy that was bitter because of the violent anti-clericalism and the unacceptable level of secularisation that Spanish society had reached during the republican years" and the law of 1939 made the priests investigators of peoples' ideological and political pasts.&lt;ref&gt;Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p. 108/1115&lt;/ref&gt;

The authorities encouraged denunciations in the workplace. For example, Barcelona's city hall obliged all government functionaries to "tell the proper authorities who the leftists are in your department and everything you know about their activities". A law passed in 1939 institutionalised the purging of public offices.&lt;ref&gt;Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Carlos Barral]] recorded that in his family "any allusion to republican relatives was scrupulously avoided; everyone took part in the enthusiasm for the new era and wrapped themselves in the folds of religiosity". Only through silence could people associated with the Republic be relatively safe from imprisonment or unemployment. After the death of Franco, the price of the peaceful transition to democracy would be silence and "the tacit agreement to forget the past",&lt;ref&gt;Unearthing Franco's Legacy p. 128–129, Michael Richards ''Grand Narratives, Collective Memory, and Social History''.&lt;/ref&gt; which was given legal status by the 1977 [[Pact of forgetting]].

[[Civil marriage]]s that had taken place in the Republic were declared null and void unless they had been validated by the Church, along with divorces. [[Divorce]], [[Birth control|contraception]] and [[abortion]]s were forbidden,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.boe.es/datos/imagenes/BOE/1954/198/A04862.tif |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626065607/http://search.boe.es/datos/imagenes/BOE/1954/198/A04862.tif |archivedate=2008-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; yet enforcement was inconsistent.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Children had to be given Christian names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The regulation of identity through names and naming in Twentieth Century Spain |url=https://thelanguageofauthoritarianregimes.wordpress.com/2016/07/06/the-regulation-of-identity-through-names-and-naming-in-twentieth-century-spain/ |accessdate=27 August 2019 |date=6 July 2016 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franco was made a member of the [[Supreme Order of Christ]] by [[Pope Pius XII]] whilst Spain itself was consecrated to the [[Sacred Heart]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Burleigh]], Sacred Causes, p. 317–318, 2006, {{ISBN|0-00-719574-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church's ties with the Franco dictatorship gave it control over the country's schools and [[crucifix]]es were once again placed in schoolrooms. After the war, Franco chose [[José Ibáñez Martín]], a member of the National Catholic Association of Propagandists, to lead the [[Ministry of Education of Spain|Ministry of Education]]. He held the post for 12 years, during which he finished the task of purging the ministry begun by the Commission of Culture and Teaching headed by [[José María Pemán]]. Pemán led the work of Catholicizing state-sponsored schools and allocating generous funding to the Church's schools.&lt;ref&gt;Unearthing Franco's Legacy p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romualdo de Toledo]], head of the National Service of Primary Education, was a traditionalist who described the model school as "the monastery founded by [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict]]". The clergy in charge of the education system sanctioned and sacked thousands of teachers of the progressive left and divided Spain's schools up among the families of falangists, loyalist soldiers and Catholic families.{{clarify|date=March 2016}} In some provinces, like [[Lugo]], practically all the teachers were dismissed. This process also affected tertiary education, as Ibáñez Martín, Catholic propagandists and the [[Opus Dei]] ensured professorships were offered only to the most faithful.&lt;ref&gt;Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p.113&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Visita de Francisco Franco y su esposa, Carmen Polo, en un acto religioso en la iglesia de Santa María (5 de 6) - Fondo Car-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|Franco visiting the [[Basilica of Saint Mary of the Chorus]] in San Sebastián]]
The orphaned children of "Reds" were taught in [[orphanage]]s run by priests and nuns that "their parents had committed great sins that they could help expiate, for which many were incited to serve the Church".&lt;ref&gt;Ignacio Fernandez de Mata, ''The Rupture of the World and the Conflicts of Memory'', essay in Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Francoism professed a strong devotion to militarism, hypermasculinity and the traditional role of women in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Valiente | first = Celia | title = Male allies of women's movements: Women's organizing within the Catholic Church in Franco's Spain | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 62 | issue =  | pages = 43–51 | publisher = [[ScienceDirect]] | doi = 10.1016/j.wsif.2017.03.004 | date = May–June 2017 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; A woman was to be loving to her parents and brothers, faithful to her husband and to reside with her family.

Women could not become judges, or testify in trial.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} They could not become university professors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} In the 1960s and 1970s, there was increasing liberalization, yet such measures would continue until Franco's death.

In 1947, Franco proclaimed Spain a monarchy through the ''Ley de Sucesión en la Jefatura del Estado'' act, but did not designate a monarch. He had no particular desire for a king because of his strained relations with the legitimist heir to the Crown, Juan of Bourbon. Therefore, he left the throne vacant with himself as regent and set the basis for his succession. This gesture was largely done to appease monarchist factions within the Movement. At the same time, Franco wore the uniform of a captain general (a rank traditionally reserved for the King), resided in the [[Royal Palace of El Pardo]], appropriated the kingly privilege of walking beneath a [[Baldachin|canopy]] and his portrait appeared on most Spanish coins. Indeed, although his formal titles were ''Jefe del Estado'' (Head of State) and ''[[Generalissimo|Generalísimo de los Ejércitos Españoles]]'' (Generalissimo of the Spanish Armies), he was referred to as [[Caudillo|Caudillo of Spain]], [[by the Grace of God]]. ''Por la Gracia de Dios'' is a technical, legal formulation which states sovereign dignity in [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]] and had been used only by monarchs before.

The long-delayed selection of Juan Carlos of Bourbon as Franco's official successor in 1969 was an unpleasant surprise for many interested parties as Juan Carlos was the rightful heir for neither the Carlists nor the Legitimists.{{Citation needed|reason=21-9-2009|date=September 2009}}

==Narrative of the Civil War==
{{See also|Spanish Civil War}}
For nearly twenty years after the war, Francoist Spain presented the conflict as a crusade against Bolshevism in defense of Christian civilization. In Francoist narrative, authoritarianism had defeated anarchy and overseen the elimination of "agitators", those "without God" and the "[[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Judeo-Masonic conspiracy]]". Since Franco had relied on thousands of North African soldiers, anti-Islamic sentiment "was played down but the centuries old myth of the Moorish threat lay at the base of the construction of the "communist menace" as a modern-day Eastern plague".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Richards, &lt;nowiki&gt;''Unearthing Franco's Legacy''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; The official position was therefore that the wartime Republic was simply a proto-Stalinist monolith, its leaders intent on creating a Spanish Soviet satellite. The anti-communist crusade narrative still exists both as "a minority academic history" and in media friendly, politically oriented productions ([[Stanley Payne]]/[[Pio Moa]]). This discourse obscured the social roots of the war and analysis of its origins. Many Spanish children grew up believing the war was fought against foreigners and the painter [[Julian Grau Santos]] has said "it was instilled in me and I always believed that Spain had won the war against foreign enemies of our historic greatness".{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} About {{formatnum:6832}} Catholic clergy were murdered by the Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;Julio de la Cueva, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/261121 "Religious Persecution, Anticlerical Tradition and Revolution: On Atrocities against the Clergy during the Spanish Civil War"] ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 33.3 (July 1998): 355.&lt;/ref&gt; Collectively, they are known as the [[martyrs of the Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Butler's Lives of the Saints"&gt;Butler, Alban and Peter Doyle [https://books.google.com/books?id=PBGzh1JK2gUC&amp;pg=PA169 Butler's Lives of the Saints] p. 169 Liturgical Press (February 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
Under the 1938 Press Law, all newspapers were put under [[Censorship|prior censorship]] and were forced to include any articles the government desired. Chief editors were nominated by the government and all journalists were required to be registered. All liberal, republican and left-wing media were prohibited.

The ''Delegación Nacional de Prensa y Propaganda'' was established as a network of government media, including daily newspapers ''[[Arriba (newspaper)|Diario Arriba]]'' and ''Pueblo''. The ''[[EFE]]'' and Pyresa government news agencies were created in 1939 and 1945. The ''[[Radio Nacional de España]]'' state radio had the exclusive right to transmit news bulletins, which all broadcasters were required to air. The [[No-Do]] were 10-minute newsreels shown at all cinemas. The ''[[Televisión Española]]'', the government television network, debuted in 1956.

The Roman Catholic Church had its own media outlets, including the Ya newspaper and the ''[[Cadena COPE]]'' radio network. Other pro-government media included ''[[Cadena SER]]'', ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'', ''[[La Vanguardia|La Vanguardia Española]]'', ''[[El Correo]]'' and ''[[El Diario Vasco]]''.

Notable independent media outlets included humor magazine ''La Codorniz''.

The 1966 Press Law dropped the prior censorship regime and allowed media outlets to select their own directors, although criticism was still a crime.

==Economic policy==
{{See also|Economic history of Spain#The Franco Era, 1939–75}}
The Civil War had ravaged the Spanish economy. Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed and daily business severely hampered. For more than a decade after Franco's victory, the economy improved little. Franco initially pursued a policy of [[autarky]], cutting off almost all international trade.  The policy had devastating effects and the economy stagnated. Only black marketeers could enjoy an evident affluence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sánchez|first=Antonio Cazorla|title=Fear and Progress: Ordinary Lives in Franco's Spain, 1939–1975|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGeHYYnODJ4C&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|accessdate=23 April 2013|pages=58–60|date=July 2010|isbn=9781444306507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, the ''[[Spanish Labour Organization|Sindicato Vertical]]'' was created. It was inspired by the ideas of José Antonio Primo de Rivera, who thought that [[class struggle]] would be ended by grouping together workers and owners according to [[Corporate statism|corporative]] principles. It was the only legal trade union and was under government control. Other trade unions were forbidden and strongly repressed along with political parties outside the Falange.

On the brink of bankruptcy, a combination of pressure from the United States, the IMF and technocrats from Opus Dei managed to "convince" the regime to adopt a free market economy in 1959 in what amounted to a mini coup d'état which removed the old guard in charge of the economy, despite the opposition of Franco. However, this economic liberalisation was not accompanied by political reforms and oppression continued unabated.

Economic growth picked up after 1959 after Franco took authority away from these ideologues and gave more power to the [[Economic liberalism|liberal]] technocrats. The country implemented several development policies and growth took off creating the "[[Spanish Miracle]]". Concurrent with the absence of social reforms and the economic power shift, a tide of mass emigration commenced to European countries and to lesser extent to South America. Emigration helped the regime in two ways: the country got rid of surplus population and the emigrants supplied the country with much needed monetary remittances.

During the 1960s, Spain experienced further increases in wealth. International firms established their factories in Spain: salaries were low, taxes nearly nonexistent, strikes were forbidden, labour health or real state regulations were unheard of and Spain was virtually a virgin market. Spain became the second fastest-growing economy in the world, just behind [[Japan]]. The rapid development of this period became known as the "Spanish Miracle". At the time of Franco's death, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe, but the gap between its GDP per capita and that of the major Western European economies had greatly narrowed. In world terms, Spain was already enjoying a fairly high material standard of living with basic but comprehensive services. However, the period between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s was to prove difficult as in addition to the [[1970s energy crisis|oil shocks]] to which Spain was highly exposed, the settling of the new political order took priority over the modernising of the economy.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In Spain and abroad, the legacy of Franco remains controversial. In Germany, a squadron named after [[Werner Mölders]] has been renamed because as a pilot he led the escorting units in the [[bombing of Guernica]]. As recently as 2006, the BBC reported that [[Maciej Giertych]], an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] of the right-wing [[League of Polish Families]], had expressed admiration for Franco's stature who allegedly "guaranteed the maintenance of traditional values in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5151504.stm Europe diary: Franco and Finland], [[BBC News]], 6 July 2006 {{in lang|en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, a commission to restore the dignity of the victims of Franco's regime and pay tribute to their memory (''comisión para reparar la dignidad y restituir la memoria de las víctimas del franquismo'') was approved in the summer of 2004 and was directed by the then-Vice President [[María Teresa Fernández de la Vega]].&lt;ref name=EP/&gt; Because of his repressive regional linguistic policies, Franco's memory is still particularly resented in Catalonia and the Basque Country.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} The Basque Provinces and Catalonia were among the regions that offered the strongest resistance to Franco in the Civil War, as well as during his regime.

In 2008, the [[Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory]] initiated a systematic search for mass graves of people executed during Franco's regime, a move supported since the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]]'s victory during the [[Spanish general election, 2004|2004 elections]] by [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]]'s government.

==Flags and heraldry==
===Flags===
{{See also|Flag of Spain|Symbols of Francoism}}
At the conclusion of the Spanish Civil War and in spite of the army's reorganisation, several sections of the army continued with their bi-colour flags improvised in 1936, but since 1940 new ensigns began to be distributed, whose main innovation was the addition of the [[eagle of Saint John]] to the shield. The new arms were allegedly inspired in the coat of arms the [[Catholic Monarchs]] adopted after the taking of [[Emirate of Granada]] from the Moors, but replacing the arms of [[Sicily]] with those of Navarre and adding the [[Pillars of Hercules]] on either side of the coat of arms. In 1938, the columns were placed outside the wings. On 26 July 1945, the commander's ensigns were suppressed by decree and on 11 October a detailed regulation of flags was published that fixed the model of the bi-colour flag in use, but better defined its details, emphasising a greater{{clarify|date=September 2011}} style of the Saint John's eagle. The models established by this decree remained in force until 1977.

During this period, two more flags were usually displayed along with the national flag: the flag of Falange (red, black and red vertical stripes, with the [[Yoke and arrows|yokes and arrows]] in the centre of the black stripe) and the traditionalist flag (white background with the [[Cross of Burgundy Flag|Cross of Burgundy]] in the middle), representing the National Movement which had unified Falange and the [[Requetés]] under the name ''Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS''.

From the death of Franco in 1975 until 1977, the national flag followed the 1945 regulations. On 21 January 1977, a new regulation was approved that stipulated an eagle with more open wings, with the restored Pillars of Hercules placed within the wings and the tape with the motto ''"[[Una, Grande y Libre]]"'' ("One, Great and Free") moved over the eagle's head from its previous position around the neck.

===Standards===
{{See also|Royal Bend of Castile|Royal Standard of Spain}}
From 1940 to 1975, Franco used the [[Royal Bend of Castile]] as Head of State's [[Military colours, standards and guidons|standard and guidon]]: the Bend between the Pillars of Hercules, crowned with an imperial crown and open royal crown.

As [[Prince of Spain]] from 1969 to 1975, Juan Carlos used a royal standard which was virtually identical to the one later adopted when he became King in 1975. The earlier standard differed only that it featured the royal crown of a Crown Prince, the King's royal crown has 8 arches of which 5 are visible, while the Prince's one has only 4 arches of which 3 are visible. The Royal Standard of Spain consists of a dark blue square with the coat of arms in the centre. The King's guidon is identical to the standard.

===Coat of arms===
{{See also|Coat of arms of Spain}}
In 1938, Franco adopted a variant of the coat of arms reinstating some elements originally used by the [[House of Trastámara]] such as [[Eagle of Saint John|Saint John's eagle]] and the yoke and arrows as follows: "Quarterly, 1 and 4. quarterly Castile and León, 2 and 3. per pale Aragon and Navarra, enté en point of Granada. The arms are crowned with an open royal crown, placed on eagle displayed sable, surrounded with the pillars of Hercules, the yoke and the bundle of arrows of the Catholic Monarchs".
