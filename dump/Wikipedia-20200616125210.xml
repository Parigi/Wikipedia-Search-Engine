'''''The Lone Gunmen''''' is an American [[conspiracy fiction]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] [[Dramatic programming|drama]] television series created by [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], [[Vince Gilligan]], [[John Shiban]], and [[Frank Spotnitz]]. The program originally aired from {{start date|2001|3|4}}, to {{end date|2001|6|1}}, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. It is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of Carter's science fiction television series ''[[The X-Files]]'' and a part of [[The X-Files (franchise)|''The X-Files'' franchise]], starring several of the show's characters. Despite positive reviews, its [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] dropped,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lonegunmen.furvect.com/lgmrate.htm The Warehouse - Ratings for the Lone Gunmen tv show&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20010414233803/http://lonegunmen.furvect.com/lgmrate.htm |date=April 14, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the show was canceled after thirteen episodes. The last episode ended on a [[cliffhanger]] which was partially resolved in a [[The X-Files (season 9)|ninth season]] episode of ''The X-Files'' entitled "[[Jump the Shark (The X-Files)|Jump the Shark]]".

The series revolves around the three characters of [[The Lone Gunmen]]: [[The Lone Gunmen#Melvin Frohike|Melvin Frohike]], [[The Lone Gunmen#John Fitzgerald Byers|John Fitzgerald Byers]], and [[The Lone Gunmen#Richard Langly|Richard Langly]], a group of investigators who run a [[conspiracy theory]] magazine. They had often helped FBI Special Agent [[Fox Mulder]] on ''The X-Files''.

==Series overview==
Whereas ''The X-Files'' deals mainly with paranormal events and conspiracies to cover up extraterrestrial contact, ''The Lone Gunmen'' draws on secret activity of other kinds, such as government-sponsored terrorism, the development of a [[surveillance society]], [[corporate crime]], and escaped Nazis. The show has a light mood and elements of [[slapstick comedy]]. The trio are alternately aided and hindered by a mysterious thief named Yves Adele Harlow.

==9/11==
In the pilot episode, which aired March 4, 2001, rogue members of the U.S. government remotely hijack an airliner departing Boston, planning to crash it into the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], and let anti-American terrorist groups take credit, to gain support for a new profitable war following the [[Cold War]]. The heroes ultimately override the controls, foiling the plot. The episode aired six months prior to the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name=tvtango&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtango.com/series/lone_gunmen/episodes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711003100/http://tvtango.com/series/lone_gunmen/episodes|title=The Lone Gunmen – Series – Episode List|publisher=TV Tango|archivedate=July 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
{{main|The Lone Gunmen}}

* John Fitzgerald Byers: Portrayed by [[Bruce Harwood]]. Byers was born in [[Sterling, Virginia]] on November 22, 1963, the day [[John F. Kennedy]] was [[JFK Assassination|assassinated]], and was named after the fallen president&amp;nbsp;– his parents were originally planning to name him Bertram after his father. Byers idolized his namesake, but he always had suspicions about the real cause of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|episodelink=Unusual Suspects (The X-Files)|title=Unusual Suspects|series=The X-Files|serieslink=The X-Files|credits=[[Kim Manners]] (director); [[Vince Gilligan]] (writer)| network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]|season=5|number=3|airdate=November 16, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byers worked as a public affairs officer for the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) in [[Baltimore]] until May 1989. Byers appears to have some working knowledge of [[medicine]], [[genetics]], and [[chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|episodelink=One Breath (X-Files Episode)|title=One Breath (X-Files Episode)|series=The X-Files|serieslink=The X-Files|credits=[[R.W. Goodwin]] (director), [[Glen Morgan]] &amp; James Wong (writers)| network =[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]|season=2|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Melvin Frohike: Portrayed by [[Tom Braidwood]]. Frohike was born circa 1953 in [[Pontiac, Michigan]]. Prior to joining the Lone Gunmen, he was an acclaimed [[Tango (dance)|tango]] dancer in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]]. On giving up the tango, he toured the country with hippies before founding Frohike Electronics Corp., specializing in cable intrusion hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=List of The Lone Gunmen episodes|title=Tango de los Pistoleros |series=The Lone Gunmen | serieslink=The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|credits=[[Bryan Spicer]] (director); [[Thomas Schnauz]] (writer)|network =[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]|season=1|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Richard "Ringo" Langly: Portrayed by [[Dean Haglund]]. Langly was born 1965 in Saltville, Nebraska. He showed an aptitude for computers from an early age, which was frowned upon by his parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|episodelink=List of The Lone Gunmen episodes|title=The Cap'n Toby Show|series=The Lone Gunmen|serieslink=The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|credits=[[Kim Manners]] (director), [[Vince Gilligan]], John Shiban &amp; [[Frank Spotnitz]] (writers)|network =[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]|season = 1|number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langly is The Lone Gunmen's expert in computers, [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking]] and [[Computer programming|programming]]. He is possibly the most paranoid of the Gunmen, taping all incoming phone calls, including those from [[Fox Mulder]].
* Yves Adele Harlow: Portrayed by [[Zuleikha Robinson]]. Harlow is a [[femme fatale]] thief who sometimes works with the Lone Gunmen trio (although sometimes she is their rival). The alias ''Yves Adele Harlow'' is an [[anagram]] for [[Lee Harvey Oswald]]. It was later revealed in ''The X-Files'' episode "[[Jump the Shark (The X-Files)|Jump the Shark]]" that Yves' real name is Lois Runtz.
* [[Jimmy Bond]]: Portrayed by [[Stephen Snedden]]. Though Bond shares the bravery and physicality of [[James Bond (character)|his namesake]], he initially appears to be rich but not very bright, and is fascinated with the Lone Gunmen, who often consider him a nuisance but appreciate his financial backing to support ''The Lone Gunman'' magazine. His saving grace is his boundless optimism, coupled with an idealistic view that the jaded Gunmen wish they still held.

==Production==
The series was filmed in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada, and in [[New York City]], New York, United States.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

''The Lone Gunmen'' received generally favorable reviews from critics. [[Julie Salamon]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave it a favorable review, stating it is "well done: shrewdly filmed, edited and written".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/03/arts/television-review-even-more-truth-is-out-there.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118233558/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/03/arts/television-review-even-more-truth-is-out-there.html|title=Television Review; Even More Truth Is Out There|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|author=Salamon, Julie|date=March 3, 2001|archivedate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' writer [[Howard Rosenberg]] gave the series a moderately positive review, saying a "bit of it is pretty funny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2001/mar/03/entertainment/ca-32511|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307111127/http://articles.latimes.com/2001/mar/03/entertainment/ca-32511|title=Lone Gunmen Is a Microchip Off the Old Files|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|author=Rosenberg, Howard|date=March 3, 2001|archivedate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Beierle, writing for DVD Talk, awarded the show 4 stars out of 5.

About the show's reception, Vince Gilligan, the co-creator of the show, said: "I have such fondness for The Lone Gunmen. I think it ended way too soon. I was crushed when The Lone Gunmen got canceled after its first season. The Lone Gunmen to this day is a show I’m still proud of, and I will always be proud of. It sort of points to an interesting phenomenon about television – you can’t really tell in advance whether a show is going to work for an audience. I would hold The Lone Gunmen up against anything that I have done before or since. For some reason, timing I guess, being the best thing to point to, it just didn’t click with an audience. If The Lone Gunmen had come on maybe a couple of years earlier, or a couple of years later, maybe it would have clicked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.x-fileslexicon.com/exclusive/vincegilligan.html|title="Another Protégé" The X-Files Lexicon's exclusive interview with Vince Gilligan, conducted by Matt Allair 2/20/2015.|website=www.x-fileslexicon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said: "my absolute belief is that we learn from failure, we don’t learn from success. And that show was in strict terms a failure. Certainly it only lasted 13 episodes and then was out. But I am still proud of that show and we had a lot of fun making it. But the “failure” of that show–and I use semi finger quotes around the word failure because I enjoyed what we did with it—it doesn't really tell me much going forward. Because so much of television I really believe comes down to timing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3694327/interview-vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/|title=Q&amp;A: Vince Gilligan on Reviving Saul Goodman in Better Call Saul|website=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;
