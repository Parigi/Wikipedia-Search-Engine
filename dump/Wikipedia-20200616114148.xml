'''Criticism of Microsoft''' has followed various aspects of its products and business practices. Issues with [[ease of use]], [[Robustness (computer science)|robustness]], and [[computer security|security]] of the company's software are common targets for critics. In the 2000s, a number of [[malware]] mishaps targeted security flaws in [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and other products. Microsoft was also accused of locking vendors and consumers in to their products, and of not following or complying with existing standards in its software.&lt;ref name="ecis-ms-history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecis.eu/documents/Finalversion_Consumerchoicepaper.pdf |title=Microsoft A History of Anticompetitive Behavior and Consumer Harm |accessdate=May 25, 2009 |date=March 31, 2009 |format=PDF |publisher=European Committee for Interoperable Systems |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618155904/http://www.ecis.eu/documents/Finalversion_Consumerchoicepaper.pdf |archive-date=June 18, 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/04/25/writing_history_with_microsofts_office/|title=Writing history with Microsoft's Office lock-in|last=Orlowski|first=Andrew|date=April 25, 2003|website=[[The Register]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190517044456/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/04/25/writing_history_with_microsofts_office/|archive-date=May 17, 2019|url-status=live|access-date=May 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Total cost of ownership]] comparisons between [[Linux]] and Microsoft Windows are a continuous point of debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cioupdate.com/budgets/article.php/1477911/Linux-TCO-Less-Than-Half-The-Cost-of-Windows.htm |title=Linux TCO: Less Than Half The Cost of Windows |accessdate=January 29, 2015 |last=Orzech |first=Dan |date=April 29, 2009 |work=CIO Updates |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208071606/http://www.cioupdate.com/budgets/article.php/1477911/Linux-TCO-Less-Than-Half-The-Cost-of-Windows.htm |archive-date=February 8, 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has been the subject of numerous [[lawsuits]], brought by several governments and by other companies, for unlawful monopolistic practices. In 2004, the [[European Union]] found Microsoft guilty in the [[European Union Microsoft competition case]], and it received a 899 million euro fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/microsoft-eu/eu-fines-microsoft-record-899-million-euros-idUSBRU00634320080227|title=EU fines Microsoft record 899 million euros|access-date=August 31, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831090402/https://www.reuters.com/article/microsoft-eu/eu-fines-microsoft-record-899-million-euros-idUSBRU00634320080227|archive-date=August 31, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immigration and Customs Enforcement ties ==
On September 14, 2019, Microsoft's flagship store was shut down by protestors as part of a [[direct action]] organized by [[Close the Camps NYC]]. The action was in response to Microsoft's $19.4 million contract with [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/14/us/anti-ice-protesters-arrested/index.html|title=76 anti-ICE protesters arrested during New York sit-in|first=Amir |last=Vera|website=CNN|access-date=2019-09-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920112742/https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/14/us/anti-ice-protesters-arrested/index.html|archive-date=September 20, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/abolish-ice-protesters-face-off-with-police-in-midtown-video/ar-AAHiDbr|title=‘Abolish ICE’ protesters face off with police in midtown [VIDEO]|website=www.msn.com|access-date=2019-09-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190915095323/https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/abolish-ice-protesters-face-off-with-police-in-midtown-video/ar-AAHiDbr|archive-date=September 15, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@CloseTheCampsNY/release-protestors-demand-microsoft-stop-profiteering-from-concentration-camps-immigrant-raids-6f86f9848950|title=RELEASE — PROTESTORS DEMAND MICROSOFT STOP PROFITEERING FROM CONCENTRATION CAMPS, IMMIGRANT RAIDS AND DEPORTATIONS|last=NYC|first=Close the Camps|date=2019-09-14|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2019-09-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190918231803/https://medium.com/@CloseTheCampsNY/release-protestors-demand-microsoft-stop-profiteering-from-concentration-camps-immigrant-raids-6f86f9848950|archive-date=September 18, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.windowscentral.com/76-anti-ice-protesters-arrested-microsoft-store-manhattan|title=76 anti-ICE protesters arrested at Microsoft Store in Manhattan|date=2019-09-16|website=Windows Central|language=en|access-date=2019-09-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190918035944/https://www.windowscentral.com/76-anti-ice-protesters-arrested-microsoft-store-manhattan|archive-date=September 18, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Microsoft's relationship with the immigration enforcement agency was revealed by executive Tom Keane, through a company blog post that describes ICE's use of the company's high-security cloud storage product [[Azure Government]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azuregov/federal-agencies-continue-to-advance-capabilities-with-azure-government/|title=Federal agencies continue to advance capabilities with Azure Government|date=2018-01-24|website=Azure Government|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190919145748/https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azuregov/federal-agencies-continue-to-advance-capabilities-with-azure-government/|archive-date=September 19, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say the company is "proud to support" the work of ICE.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Microsoft has stated it "is not working with the U.S. government on any projects related to separating children from their families at the border."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Military ties==
In February 2019, some of Microsoft employees protested the company's [[war profiteering]] from a $480 million contract to develop [[augmented reality]] headsets for the [[United States Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/22/microsoft-protest-us-army-augmented-reality-headsets|title='We won't be war profiteers': Microsoft workers protest $480m army contract|newspaper=The Guardian|date=February 22, 2019|last1=Wong|first1=Julia Carrie|access-date=February 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223133132/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/22/microsoft-protest-us-army-augmented-reality-headsets|archive-date=February 23, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vendor lock-in ==
From its inception, Microsoft defined itself as a platform company and understood the importance of attracting third-party programmers. It did so by providing development tools, training, access to proprietary [[application programming interface|API]]s in early versions, and partner programs. Although the resulting ubiquity of Microsoft software allows a user to benefit from [[network effect]]s, critics and even Microsoft itself decry what they consider to be an "[[embrace, extend and extinguish]]" strategy of adding proprietary features to open standards or their software implementations, thereby using its market dominance to gain unofficial ownership of standards "extended" in this way.&lt;ref name="ZDExecExtinguish"&gt;{{cite news

Microsoft software is also presented as a "safe" choice for IT managers purchasing software systems. In an internal memo for senior management Microsoft's head of [[C++]] development, Aaron Contorer, stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1016-5197411.html|title=EU report takes Microsoft to task|accessdate=June 6, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616081801/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1016-5197411.html|archive-date=June 16, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The [[Windows API]] is so broad, so deep, and so functional that most [[independent software vendor|Independent Software Vendors]] would be crazy not to use it. And it is so deeply embedded in the source code of many Windows apps that there is a huge switching cost to using a different operating system instead... It is this switching cost that has given the customers the patience to stick with Windows through all our mistakes, our buggy drivers, our high TCO ([[total cost of ownership]]), our lack of a sexy vision at times, and many other difficulties [...] Customers constantly evaluate other desktop platforms, [but] it would be so much work to move over that they hope we just improve Windows rather than force them to move. In short, without this exclusive franchise called the Windows API, we would have been dead a long time ago.}}

More recently, Microsoft had their [[OOXML]] specification approved by the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards body in a manner consistent with previous attempts to control standards.&lt;ref name="Groklaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20071023002351958|title=How to Get Your Platform Accepted as a Standard - Microsoft Style|author=Jones|first=Pamela|date=February 17, 2008|publisher=[[Groklaw]] News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513080150/http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20071023002351958|archive-date=May 13, 2019|url-status=live|accessdate=May 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|Secure boot}}
With the release of [[Windows 8]], Microsoft began requiring OEM devices to ship with [[UEFI]] system firmware, configured by default to only allow the execution of operating system binaries digitally signed by Microsoft ([[UEFI secure boot]]). Concerns were raised that this requirement would hinder the use of alternate operating systems such as [[Linux]]. In a post discussing secure boot on the ''Building Windows 8'' blog, Microsoft developer Tony Mangefeste indicated that vendors would provide means to customize secure boot, stating that "At the end of the day, the customer is in control of their PC. Microsoft's philosophy is to provide customers with the best experience first, and allow them to make decisions themselves."&lt;ref name="building-secureboot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/22/protecting-the-pre-os-environment-with-uefi.aspx |title=Protecting the pre-OS environment with UEFI |first=Tony |last=Mangefeste |date=September 22, 2011 |publisher=Building Windows 8 |accessdate=October 17, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120802042640/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/22/protecting-the-pre-os-environment-with-uefi.aspx |archivedate=August 2, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/248342/windows_8_secure_boot_the_controversy_continues.html |title=Windows 8 Secure Boot: The Controversy Continues |work=PCWorld |publisher=IDG |first=Katherine |last=Noyes |date=January 18, 2012 |accessdate=August 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005023808/http://www.pcworld.com/article/248342/windows_8_secure_boot_the_controversy_continues.html |archive-date=October 5, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, vendors were required to provide means for users to re-configure or disable secure boot (although devices running [[Windows RT]], a variation of Windows 8 for [[ARM architecture]], have locked firmware where this cannot be disabled).&lt;ref name=warren /&gt;&lt;ref name=warren&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/2012/1/16/2710502/microsoft-secure-boot-windows-8-arm |title=Windows 8 ARM devices won't have the option to switch off Secure Boot |first=Tom |last=Warren |work=[[The Verge]] |date=January 16, 2012 |accessdate=August 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65vAF4cmk?url=http://www.theverge.com/microsoft/2012/1/16/2710502/microsoft-secure-boot-windows-8-arm |archive-date=March 4, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired-sb"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Garling |first=Caleb |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2011/09/windows-8-secure-boot-sparks-linux-furor-and-a-microsoft-response/ |title=Windows 8 Secure Boot Sparks Linux Furor, and a Microsoft Response |work=[[Wired.com]] |publisher=Condé Nast |date=September 23, 2011 |accessdate=August 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725002533/http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2011/09/windows-8-secure-boot-sparks-linux-furor-and-a-microsoft-response |archive-date=July 25, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jon |last=Brodkin |url=https://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/01/microsoft-mandating-secure-boot-on-arm-making-linux-installs-difficult.ars |title=Microsoft mandating Secure Boot on ARM, making Linux installs difficult |work=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=Condé Nast |date=January 16, 2012 |accessdate=August 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409040152/http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/01/microsoft-mandating-secure-boot-on-arm-making-linux-installs-difficult.ars |archive-date=April 9, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; No mandate is made regarding the installation of third-party certificates that would enable running alternative programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworlduk.com/blogs/open-enterprise/is-microsoft-blocking-linux-booting-on-arm-hardware-3569162/|title=Is Microsoft Blocking Linux Booting on ARM Hardware?|first=Glyn|last=Moody|date=January 12, 2012|work=[[Computerworld]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|access-date=May 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405170058/http://www.computerworlduk.com/blogs/open-enterprise/is-microsoft-blocking-linux-booting-on-arm-hardware-3569162/|archive-date=April 5, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.computerworld.com/19577/why_microsoft_should_lift_the_possible_ban_on_linux_booting_on_windows_arm_devices |title=Why Microsoft should lift the possible ban on Linux booting on Windows 8 ARM devices |work=[[Computerworld]] |publisher=[[IDG]] |date=January 13, 2012 |accessdate=January 27, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518223506/http://blogs.computerworld.com/19577/why_microsoft_should_lift_the_possible_ban_on_linux_booting_on_windows_arm_devices |archivedate=May 18, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Niccolai |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9223446/Windows_8_on_ARM_You_can_look_but_you_can_t_touch |title=Windows 8 on ARM: You can look but you can't touch |work=[[Computerworld]] |publisher=[[IDG]] |date=January 13, 2012 |accessdate=January 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131130956/http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9223446/Windows_8_on_ARM_You_can_look_but_you_can_t_touch |archive-date=January 31, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Copyright enforcement ==
When Microsoft discovered that its first product, [[Altair BASIC]], was subject to widespread [[Copyright infringement of software|unauthorized copying]], Microsoft founder [[Bill Gates]] wrote an [[Open Letter to Hobbyists]] that openly accused many hobbyists of stealing software. Gates' letter provoked many responses, with some hobbyists objecting to the broad accusation, and others supporting the principle of compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Bill |last=Gates |date=April 1976 |title=A Second and Final Letter |journal=Computer Notes |url=http://startup.nmnaturalhistory.org/gallery/computernotes.php |accessdate=March 23, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323162008/http://startup.nmnaturalhistory.org/gallery/computernotes.php |archivedate=March 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Halloween documents]], internal Microsoft memos which were leaked to the open source community beginning in 1998, indicate that some Microsoft employees perceive [[free software|"open source" software]] — in particular, [[Linux]] — as a growing long-term threat to Microsoft's position in the software industry. The Halloween documents acknowledged that parts of Linux are superior to the versions of Microsoft Windows available at the time, and outlined a strategy of "de-commoditize[ing] protocols &amp; applications."&lt;ref name="ZDExecExtinguish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GroklawAlepin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DobbsExtinguish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IWKerberos"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/halloween/|title=Halloween Document 8|last=Raymond|first=Eric S.|date=|website=catb.org|publisher=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006165712/http://www.catb.org/~esr/halloween/|archive-date=October 6, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern of critics is that Microsoft may be using the distribution of [[shared source|shared source software]] to harvest names of developers who have been exposed to Microsoft code, as some believe that these developers could someday be the target of lawsuits if they were ever to participate in the development of competing products.

This includes the use of [[permatemp]] employees (employees employed for years as "temporary," and therefore without medical benefits), use of [[forced retention]] tactics, where departing employees would be sued to prevent departure, as well as more traditional cost-saving measures, ranging from cutting medical benefits to not providing towels in company locker rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_39/b3952001.htm|title=Troubling Exits At Microsoft|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502084953/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_39/b3952001.htm|archivedate=May 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is often referred to as a "Velvet Sweatshop", a term which originated in a 1989 ''[[Seattle Times]]'' article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Andrews | first=Paul | title=A 'Velvet Sweatshop' or a High-Tech Heaven? | date=April 23, 1989 | newspaper=The Seattle Times | url=http://www.krsaborio.net/research/1980s/89/890423.htm | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120629191556/http://www.krsaborio.net/research/1980s/89/890423.htm | archivedate=June 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later became used to describe the company by some of Microsoft's own employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Editor's note, MSJ August 1997 | url=https://www.microsoft.com/msj/0897/ednote0897.aspx | accessdate=September 27, 2005 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214061859/http://www.microsoft.com/msj/0897/ednote0897.aspx | archive-date=February 14, 2007 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; This characterization is derived from the perception that Microsoft provides nearly everything for its employees in a convenient place, but in turn overworks them to a point where it would be bad for their (possibly long-term) health. For example, the [[kitchenette]]s have free beverages and many buildings include exercise rooms and showers. However, the company has been accused of attempting to keep employees at the company for unreasonably long hours and working them too much. This is detailed in several books about Microsoft, including ''Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire''.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

A US state lawsuit was brought against Microsoft in 1992 representing 8,558 current and former employees that had been classified as "temporary" and "freelance", and became known as ''[[Vizcaino v. Microsoft]]''. In 1993, the suit became a US Federal Class Action in the United States District Court Western District Of Washington At Seattle as No. C93-178C. The Final Settlement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; came in 2005. The case was decided on the (IRS-defined) basis that such "permatemps" had their jobs defined by Microsoft, worked alongside regular employees doing the same work, and worked for long terms. After a series of court setbacks including three reversals on appeal, Microsoft settled the suit for US$97 million.

A side effect of the "permatemp" lawsuit is that now contract employees are prevented from participating in team morale events and other activities that could be construed as making them "employees". They are also limited to 18-month contracts and must leave after that time for 6 months before returning under contract.

== Advertising and public relations ==
Critics have alleged that Microsoft has used funding to drum up support from think tanks and trade organizations such as the [[Alexis de Tocqueville Institution]] (AdTI), the [[Independent Institute]], and [[Americans for Technology Leadership]] (ATL). During the antitrust case [[United States v. Microsoft]], ATL sent a poll to 19 state attorneys general purporting to show that "the public believes state AGs should devote their energy to causes other than Microsoft".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Carney |first=Dan |url=http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_20/b3681219.htm |title=Microsoft's All-Out Counterattack |magazine=Business Week |date=May 15, 2000 |accessdate=November 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110118071526/http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_20/b3681219.htm |archivedate=January 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during the case the Independent Institute ran full-page advertisements in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' defending Microsoft, which was later revealed to have funded the ad campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brinkley|first=Joel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/18/business/microsoft-covered-cost-of-ads-backing-it-in-antitrust-suit.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=Microsoft Covered Cost of Ads Backing It in Antitrust Suit|date=September 18, 1999|accessdate=November 8, 2012|work=The New York Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522012742/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/18/business/microsoft-covered-cost-of-ads-backing-it-in-antitrust-suit.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|archive-date=May 22, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute published ''Winners, Losers, and Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology'' shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Winners, Losers, and Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology |first1=Stan J. |last1=Liebowitz |first2=Stephen E. |last2=Margolis |publisher=Independent Institute |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-94599-980-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/winnerslosersmic00lieb/page/344 344] |url=https://archive.org/details/winnerslosersmic00lieb/page/344 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June 2002, the AdTI published a report, quickly pulled under the argument that it was a draft version, which contained criticism of the [[copyleft]] model and the [[GNU General Public License]]. A May 2002 press release for the report stated that it would contain arguments suggesting that governments could be threatened by hackers and [[terrorists]] (who could study potential vulnerabilities due to source availability) if it used [[Open-source software|open source software]]. However, the draft contained no references to these topics.

"[[Champagne (advertisement)|Champagne]]", a 2002 British television advert for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], received 136 complaints from viewers to the [[Independent Television Commission]] (ITC) over its content. The advert featured a newborn baby being launched out of its mother—aging as it flies through the air, and crashing into a gravestone. It contained the tagline "Life is short, play more." The advert was banned from television by the ITC, who considered it to be "offensive, shocking and in bad taste", noting complaints citing the advert's themes of death and the "traumatic experience" the person was facing in the ad.&lt;ref name=Mother&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milmo|first1=Cahal|title=Xbox's advert pulled after protest from TV watchdog|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/xboxs-advert-pulled-after-protest-from-tv-watchdog-179193.html|accessdate=April 24, 2017|work=[[The Independent]]|date=June 6, 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425114218/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/xboxs-advert-pulled-after-protest-from-tv-watchdog-179193.html|archive-date=April 25, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-12-06-15-years-on-the-story-behind-one-of-xboxs-most-notorious-tv-ads|title=15 years on: The story behind one of Xbox's most notorious TV ads|website=GamesIndustry.biz|language=en|access-date=2019-05-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530162739/https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-12-06-15-years-on-the-story-behind-one-of-xboxs-most-notorious-tv-ads|archive-date=May 30, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, ''The Guardian'' elaborated that leaked documents show that:
* Microsoft helped the NSA to circumvent its encryption to intercept web chats on [[Outlook.com]] and gave it unencrypted access to Outlook.com and [[Hotmail]] email.
* Microsoft provided the NSA with access to users' data on its cloud storage service OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive).
* After Microsoft bought [[Skype]], the NSA tripled the number of Skype video calls being collected through PRISM.&lt;ref name="Guardian12July"/&gt;
In a statement, Microsoft said that they "provide customer data only in response to legal processes."&lt;ref name="Guardian12July"&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|title=How Microsoft handed the NSA access to encrypted messages|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data|accessdate=July 12, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=July 12, 2013|author2=Ewen MacAskill|author3=Laura Poitras|author4=Spencer Ackerman|author5=Dominic Rushe|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119014627/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data|archive-date=November 19, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telemetry and data collection ===
[[Windows 10]] was criticized on-launch for having default settings that send various information regarding user behaviors to Microsoft and its "trusted partners", such as data regarding user contacts and calendar events (to optimize text and speech input), location data and history, "telemetry" (diagnostics data that is used by Microsoft to help service and optimize the operating system;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-telemetry-secrets/|title=Windows 10 telemetry secrets: Where, when, and why Microsoft collects your data|last=Bott|first=Ed|website=ZDNet|language=en|access-date=2019-07-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190712012214/https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-telemetry-secrets/|archive-date=July 12, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; this could not be fully disabled on non-enterprise versions of Windows 10), an "advertising ID", as well as further data when the [[Cortana]] assistant is enabled in full.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/windows-10-doesnt-offer-much-privacy-by-default-heres-how-to-fix-it/|title=Windows 10 doesn’t offer much privacy by default: Here’s how to fix it|last=Anthony|first=Sebastian|date=August 4, 2015|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528175753/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/windows-10-doesnt-offer-much-privacy-by-default-heres-how-to-fix-it/|archive-date=May 28, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=extremetech-privacysettings&gt;{{cite web |title=Windows 10s default privacy settings and controls leave much to be desired |url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/211208-windows-10s-default-privacy-settings-and-controls-leave-much-to-be-desired |website=[[ExtremeTech]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |accessdate=July 31, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150730185512/http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/211208-windows-10s-default-privacy-settings-and-controls-leave-much-to-be-desired |archive-date=July 30, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/31/windows-10-microsoft-faces-criticism-over-privacy-default-settings|title=Windows 10: Microsoft under attack over privacy|last=Hern|first=Alex|date=August 1, 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-05-28|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528175753/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/31/windows-10-microsoft-faces-criticism-over-privacy-default-settings|archive-date=May 28, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Microsoft faced criticism from [[France]]'s data protection commission and the [[European Union]] for its practices in regards to Windows 10. On subsequent iterations of the OS, Microsoft has clarified its data collection policies, and made its [[out-of-box experience]] provide clearer information on Windows privacy settings, and the effects they have on the overall user experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/6/17086754/microsoft-windows-10-privacy-changes-features|title=Microsoft’s new Windows 10 privacy controls should avoid ‘keylogger’ concerns|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=March 6, 2018|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528175753/https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/6/17086754/microsoft-windows-10-privacy-changes-features|archive-date=May 28, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/21/12246266/france-microsoft-privacy-windows-10-cnil|title=France orders Microsoft to stop tracking Windows 10 users|last=Toor|first=Amar|date=July 21, 2016|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528175753/https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/21/12246266/france-microsoft-privacy-windows-10-cnil|archive-date=May 28, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/5/15188636/microsoft-windows-10-data-collection-documents-privacy-concerns|title=Microsoft finally reveals what data Windows 10 really collects|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=April 5, 2017|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528175753/https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/5/15188636/microsoft-windows-10-data-collection-documents-privacy-concerns|archive-date=May 28, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/21/14682256/microsoft-windows-10-eu-privacy-concerns|title=EU still concerned over Windows 10 privacy despite Microsoft’s changes|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=February 21, 2017|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528175753/https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/21/14682256/microsoft-windows-10-eu-privacy-concerns|archive-date=May 28, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft also simplified its "telemetry" options to only consist of "Basic" and "Full" modes, and reduced the amount of system information collected in "Basic" mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.extremetech.com/computing/243079-upcoming-windows-update-reduces-spying-microsoft-still-mum-data-collects|title=Upcoming Windows 10 update reduces spying, but Microsoft is still mum on which data it specifically collects|website=ExtremeTech|access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528223542/https://www.extremetech.com/computing/243079-upcoming-windows-update-reduces-spying-microsoft-still-mum-data-collects|archive-date=May 28, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Robot Journalism==
In May 2020, [[Microsoft]] announced that a number of its [[MSN]] contract journalists would be replaced by robot journalism leading to criticism about which stories would be displayed and their quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Microsoft sacks journalists to replace them with robots |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/30/microsoft-sacks-journalists-to-replace-them-with-robots |work=the Guardian |date=30 May 2020 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Microsoft 'to replace journalists with robots' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52860247 |accessdate=31 May 2020 |work=BBC News |date=30 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Microsoft is cutting dozens of MSN news production workers and replacing them with artificial intelligence |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/local-business/microsoft-is-cutting-dozens-of-msn-news-production-workers-and-replacing-them-with-artificial-intelligence/ |work=The Seattle Times |date=29 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Xbox Live prohibition on use of the word "gay" ==
Microsoft has come under some criticism for its attitude to [[homosexuality]] and Xbox Live. Users may not use the string "gay" in a gamertag (even in a non-homosexual context, for example as part of a surname), or refer to homosexuality in their profile (including self-identifying as such), as the company considers this "content of a sexual nature" or "offensive" to other users and therefore unsuitable for the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/390593/thegayergamer-gets-xbox-live-ban-microsoft-explains|title="theGAYERGamer" Gets Xbox Live Ban, Microsoft Explains|first=Leigh|last=Alexander|publisher=|access-date=March 4, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301130559/http://kotaku.com/390593/thegayergamer-gets-xbox-live-ban-microsoft-explains|archive-date=March 1, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5010324/microsoft-explains-gaywood-ban|title=Microsoft Explains "Gaywood" Ban|first=Leigh|last=Alexander|publisher=|access-date=March 4, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228083923/http://kotaku.com/5010324/microsoft-explains-gaywood-ban|archive-date=February 28, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://consumerist.com/2009/02/25/identifying-yourself-as-a-lesbian-gets-you-banned-on-xbox-live/|title=Identifying Yourself As A Lesbian Gets You Banned On XBOX Live|date=February 25, 2009|publisher=|access-date=September 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008172650/https://consumerist.com/2009/02/25/identifying-yourself-as-a-lesbian-gets-you-banned-on-xbox-live/|archive-date=October 8, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After banning 'Teresa', a lesbian gamer who had been harassed by other users for being a homosexual, a senior Xbox Live team member, [[Stephen Toulouse]], has clarified the policy, stating that "Expression of any sexual orientation [...] is not allowed in gamertags" but that they are "examining how we can provide it in a way that won't get misused".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5160677/microsoft-looking-to-change-xbox-live-sexual-discrimination|title=Microsoft Looking To Change Xbox Live Sexual "Discrimination"|first=Luke|last=Plunkett|access-date=March 4, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516062012/http://kotaku.com/5160677/microsoft-looking-to-change-xbox-live-sexual-discrimination|archive-date=May 16, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stepto.com/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=530 "Xbox LIVE policy and Gamertags/Profiles Redux"]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GLAAD]] weighed in on the controversy as well, supporting the steps that Microsoft has taken over the years to engage the LGBT community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glaadblog.org/2009/02/26/xbox-live-homophobia-and-online-gaming-policy|title=XBox Live, Homophobia, and Online Gaming Policy|date=September 14, 2011|publisher=|access-date=July 3, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416073323/http://glaadblog.org/2009/02/26/xbox-live-homophobia-and-online-gaming-policy/|archive-date=April 16, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
