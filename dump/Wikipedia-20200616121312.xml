The planet [[Mars]] has been explored remotely by spacecraft. Probes sent from Earth, beginning in the late 20th century, have yielded a large increase in knowledge about the Martian system, focused primarily on understanding [[Geology of Mars|its geology]] and [[Planetary habitability|habitability]] potential.&lt;ref name="SCI-20140124a"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grotzinger |first=John P. |title=Introduction to Special Issue – Habitability, Taphonomy and the Search for Organic Carbon on Mars |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=24 January 2014 |volume=343 |number=6169 |pages=386–387 |doi=10.1126/science.1249944 |bibcode=2014Sci...343..386G |pmid=24458635|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Engineering [[Interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary journeys]] is complicated and the '''exploration of Mars''' has experienced a high failure rate, especially the early attempts. Roughly sixty percent of all spacecraft destined for Mars failed before completing their missions and some failed before their observations could begin. Some missions have met with unexpected success, such as the twin [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s, which operated for years beyond their specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/space/space-exploration/mars-exploration-article/|title=Mars Exploration, Mars Rovers Information, Facts, News, Photos – National Geographic|last=Society|first=National Geographic|website=National Geographic|access-date=2016-03-04|date=2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
[[File:Schiaparelli 1889 versus Mars crop.jpg|thumb|A 19th century hand drawn map by Schiaparelli, and more modern photographic image, with a blended one in the middle.]]
On June 10, 2018, ''Opportunity'' rover fell silent, leaving ''[[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity]]'' of the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] mission with six orbiters surveying the planet: ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars Odyssey]]'', ''[[Mars Express]]'', ''[[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]'', ''[[Mars Orbiter Mission]]'', [[MAVEN]], and the [[Trace Gas Orbiter]], which have contributed massive amounts of information about Mars. The stationary lander ''[[InSight]]'' is investigating the deep interior of Mars. No [[sample return mission]]s have been attempted for Mars and an attempted return mission for Mars' [[Natural satellite|moon]] [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] (''[[Fobos-Grunt]]'') failed at launch in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.space.com/13558-historic-mars-missions.html|title=A Brief History of Mars Missions {{!}} Mars Exploration|website=Space.com|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five more missions are in the late stages of development and fabrication, and will be launched between 2020 and 2021. These include the ExoMars [[Rosalind Franklin (rover)|''Rosalind Franklin'' rover]] and [[Kazachok|landing platform ''Kazachok'']] by Roscosmos and ESA, NASA's [[Mars 2020]], the [[2020 Chinese Mars Mission]], the [[Hope Mars Mission]] by the United Arab Emirates, and India's [[Mars Orbiter Mission 2]].

==Martian system==
{{Main|Mars|Martian surface|Atmosphere of Mars|Moons of Mars}}
Mars has long been the subject of human interest. Early telescopic observations revealed color changes on the surface that were attributed to seasonal vegetation and apparent [[martian canal|linear features]] were ascribed to intelligent design. Further telescopic observations found two moons, [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]], polar ice caps and the feature now known as [[Olympus Mons]], the [[Solar System]]'s second tallest mountain.  The discoveries piqued further interest in the study and exploration of the red planet. Mars is a rocky planet, like Earth, that formed around the same time, yet with only half the diameter of Earth, and a far thinner atmosphere; it has a cold and desert-like surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Sheehan | first=William | url=http://www.uapress.arizona.edu/onlinebks/mars/contents.htm | title= The Planet Mars: A History of Observation and Discovery | publisher = The University of Arizona Press, Tucson| year = 1996 | accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way the surface of Mars has been categorized, is by thirty "[[Quadrangle (geography)|quadrangles]]", with each quadrangle named for a prominent physiographic feature within that quadrangle.&lt;ref name="mapping mars" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ralphaeschliman.com/id30.htm |title=Online Atlas of Mars |work=Ralphaeschliman.com |accessdate=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch windows==
[[File:Mars distance from Earth.svg|thumb|right|Spacecraft launches and Mars distance from Earth in millions of kilometers]]
The minimum-energy [[launch window]]s for a Martian expedition occur at intervals of approximately two years and two months (specifically 780 days, the planet's [[synodic period]] with respect to Earth).&lt;ref name="portree2001"&gt;David S. F. Portree, ''Humans to Mars: Fifty Years of Mission Planning, 1950–2000,'' NASA Monographs in Aerospace History Series, Number 21, February 2001. Available as [https://history.nasa.gov/monograph21/humans_to_Mars.htm NASA SP-2001-4521].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the lowest available transfer energy varies on a roughly 16-year cycle.&lt;ref name="portree2001"/&gt; For example, a minimum occurred in the 1969 and 1971 launch windows, rising to a peak in the late 1970s, and hitting another low in 1986 and 1988.&lt;ref name="portree2001"/&gt;

Starting in 1960, the Soviets launched a series of probes to Mars including the first intended flybys and hard ([[impact (mechanics)|impact]]) landing ([[Mars 1962B]]).&lt;ref name=log/&gt; The first successful flyby of Mars was on 14–15 July 1965, by NASA's [[Mariner 4]].&lt;ref name="NSSDCm"&gt;{{cite web  | url = https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1964-077A  | title = Mariner 4  | website = NSSDC Master Catalog  | publisher = [[NASA]]  | accessdate = 2009-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 14, 1971, [[Mariner 9]] became the first space probe to orbit another planet when it entered into orbit around Mars.&lt;ref name="nasa_mariner9"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Mariner_09 |title=Mariner 9: Overview |publisher=NASA |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731101459/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Mariner_09 |archivedate=2012-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of data returned by probes increased dramatically as technology improved.&lt;ref name=log&gt;[http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/programmissions/missions/ NASA PROGRAM &amp; MISSIONS Historical Log]. Mars.jpl.nasa.gov. Retrieved on 2012-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first to contact the surface were two [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] probes: [[Mars 2]] lander on November 27 and [[Mars 3]] lander on December 2, 1971{{mdash}}Mars 2 failed during descent and Mars 3 about twenty seconds after the first Martian [[soft landing (rocketry)|soft landing]].&lt;ref name="mars2"&gt;[https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1971-045D Mars 2 Lander – NASA].

Retrieved on 2012-05-10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mars 6]] failed during descent but did return some corrupted atmospheric data in 1974.&lt;ref name="nasa2"&gt;[https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1973-052A Mars 6 – NASA]. Nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov. Retrieved on 2012-05-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1975 NASA launches of the [[Viking program]] consisted of two orbiters, each with a lander that successfully soft landed in 1976. ''[[Viking 1]]'' remained operational for six years, ''[[Viking 2]]'' for three. The Viking landers relayed the first color panoramas of Mars.&lt;ref name="other_missions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/stu/20th_far_mars.html|title=Other Mars Missions|website=Journey through the galaxy|accessdate=2006-06-13|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920021900/http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/stu/20th_far_mars.html|archivedate=2006-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet probes [[Phobos program|Phobos 1 and 2]] were sent to Mars in 1988 to study Mars and its two moons, with a focus on Phobos. Phobos 1 lost contact on the way to Mars. Phobos 2, while successfully photographing Mars and Phobos, failed before it was set to release two landers to the surface of Phobos.&lt;ref name="nature341"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sagdeev, R. Z. |author2=Zakharov, A. V. |title=Brief history of the Phobos mission|journal=Nature|volume=341|issue=6243|pages=581–585|date=October 19, 1989|doi=10.1038/341581a0|bibcode = 1989Natur.341..581S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mars has a reputation as a difficult space exploration target; just [[List of missions to Mars|25 of 55 missions through 2019]], or 45.5%, have been fully successful, with a further three partially successful and partially failed.  However, of the sixteen missions since 2001, twelve of those have been successful and eight of those are still operational.

Missions that ended prematurely after Phobos 1 and 2 (1988) include (see [[#Probing difficulties|Probing difficulties]] section for more details):
*[[Mars Observer]] (launched in 1992)
*[[Mars 96]] (1996)
*[[Mars Climate Orbiter]] (1999)
*[[Mars Polar Lander]] with [[Deep Space 2]] (1999)
*[[Nozomi (spacecraft)|Nozomi]] (2003)
*[[Beagle 2]] (2003)
*[[Fobos-Grunt]] with [[Yinghuo-1]] (2011)
*[[Schiaparelli EDM lander|''Schiaparelli'' lander]] (2016)

Following the 1993 failure of the [[Mars Observer]] orbiter, the NASA [[Mars Global Surveyor]] achieved Mars orbit in 1997. This mission was a complete success, having finished its primary mapping mission in early 2001. Contact was lost with the probe in November 2006 during its third extended program, spending exactly 10 operational years in space. The NASA [[Mars Pathfinder]], carrying a robotic exploration vehicle ''[[Sojourner (rover)|Sojourner]]'', landed in the [[Ares Vallis]] on Mars in the summer of 1997, returning many images.&lt;ref name="cnn_mgs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/9706/pathfinder/surveyor/|title=Mars Global Surveyor|work=CNN- Destination Mars|accessdate=2006-06-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060415081709/http://www.cnn.com/TECH/9706/pathfinder/surveyor/ |archivedate = 2006-04-15|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Beagle 2'' was located in January 2015 by HiRise camera on NASA's ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter'' (MRO) having landed safely but failed to fully deploy its solar panels and antenna.&lt;ref name="spotted"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pearson |first=Michael |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/16/world/mars-beagle-lander-found/index.html |title=UK's Beagle 2 lander spotted on Mars |work=CNN |date=16 January 2015 |accessdate=2015-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esa20040211"&gt;{{cite news | author=ESA Media Relations Division | title=UK and ESA announce Beagle 2 inquiry | work=ESA News | date=February 11, 2004 | url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMQ5C1PGQD_Expanding_0.html | accessdate=2011-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2004, the ''Mars Express'' [[Planetary Fourier Spectrometer]] team announced the orbiter had detected [[Methane on Mars|methane]] in the Martian atmosphere, a potential [[biosignature]].

In January 2004, the NASA twin [[Mars Exploration Rovers]] named ''[[Spirit rover|Spirit]]'' (MER-A) and ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]'' (MER-B) landed on the surface of Mars. Both have met and  exceeded all their science objectives. Among the most significant scientific returns has been conclusive evidence that liquid water existed at some time in the past at both landing sites. [[Dust devils#Martian dust devils|Martian dust devils]] and windstorms have occasionally cleaned both rovers' solar panels, and thus increased their lifespan.&lt;ref name="nasa_rovers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/science/|title=Mars Exploration Rovers- Science|website=MER website|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2006-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Spirit'' rover (MER-A) was active until 2010, when it stopped sending data because it got stuck in a sand dune and was unable to reorient itself to recharge its batteries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On 10 March 2006, NASA's ''[[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]'' (MRO) probe arrived in orbit to conduct a two-year science survey. The orbiter began mapping the Martian terrain and weather to find suitable landing sites for upcoming lander missions. The MRO captured the first image of a series of active [[avalanche]]s near the planet's north pole in 2008.&lt;ref name="cnn_avalanche"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/TECH/space/03/03/mars.avalanche.ap/index.html|title=Photo shows avalanche on Mars|work=CNN|accessdate=2008-03-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080419070652/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/TECH/space/03/03/mars.avalanche.ap/index.html |archivedate = April 19, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview of missions===
The following entails a brief overview of Mars exploration, oriented towards orbiters and flybys; see also [[Mars landing]] and [[Mars rover]].

====Early Soviet missions====
{{Main|Mars 1M|Mars 1|Mars program}}

=====1960s=====
[[File:Mars 1M.jpg|thumb|[[Mars 1M]] spacecraft]]

Between 1960 and 1969, the [[Soviet Union]] launched nine probes intended to reach Mars. They all failed: three at launch; three failed to reach near-Earth orbit; one during the burn to put the spacecraft into trans-Mars trajectory; and two during the interplanetary orbit.

The [[Mars 1M]] programs (sometimes dubbed Marsnik in Western media) was the first Soviet unmanned spacecraft interplanetary exploration program, which consisted of two flyby probes launched towards Mars in October 1960, [[Mars 1960A]] and [[Mars 1960B]] (also known as ''Korabl 4'' and ''Korabl 5'' respectively). After launch, the third stage pumps on both launchers were unable to develop enough pressure to commence ignition, so Earth parking orbit was not achieved. The spacecraft reached an altitude of 120&amp;nbsp;km before reentry.

[[Sputnik 22|Mars 1962A]] was a Mars flyby mission, launched on October 24, 1962 and [[Sputnik 24|Mars 1962B]] an intended first Mars [[lander (spacecraft)|lander]] mission, launched in late December of the same year (1962). Both failed from either breaking up as they were going into Earth orbit or having the upper stage explode in orbit during the burn to put the spacecraft into trans-Mars trajectory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

======The first success======
&lt;!--Not a success if the unnamed orbiter did not enter orbit:

[[Mars 1]] (1962 Beta Nu 1), an automatic interplanetary spacecraft launched to Mars on November 1, 1962, was the first probe of the Soviet [[Mars probe program]] to achieve interplanetary orbit. Mars 1 was intended to fly by the planet at a distance of about 11,000&amp;nbsp;km and take images of the surface as well as send back data on [[cosmic radiation]], [[micrometeoroid]] impacts and Mars' [[magnetic field]], radiation environment, atmospheric structure, and possible organic compounds.&lt;ref name="Sputnik 23"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://jtgnew.sjrdesign.net/exploration_space_planetary_mars.html | title = "Journey Through the Galaxy" Mars Program: Mars ~ 1960–1974 | accessdate = 2014-01-26 | last = Robbins | first = Stuart | year = 2008 | publisher = SJR Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mihos 2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/stu/advanced/20th_soviet_mars.html |title=Mars (1960–1974): Mars 1 |accessdate=2014-01-26 |last=Mihos |first=Chris |date=11 January 2006 |website=Department of Astronomy, Case Western Reserve University. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013211415/http://burro.astr.cwru.edu/stu/advanced/20th_soviet_mars.html |archivedate=2013-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty-one radio transmissions were held, initially at 2-day intervals and later at 5-day intervals, from which a large amount of interplanetary data was collected. On 21 March 1963, when the spacecraft was at a distance of 106,760,000&amp;nbsp;km from Earth, on its way to Mars, communications ceased due to failure of its antenna orientation system.&lt;ref name="Sputnik 23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mihos 2006"/&gt;

In 1964, both Soviet probe launches, of [[Zond 1964A]] on June 4, and [[Zond 2]] on November 30, (part of the [[Zond program]]), resulted in failures. Zond 1964A had a failure at launch, while communication was lost with Zond 2 en route to Mars after a mid-course maneuver, in early May 1965.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1969, and as part of the [[Mars probe program]], the Soviet Union prepared two identical 5-ton orbiters called M-69, dubbed by NASA as [[Mars 1969A]] and [[Mars 1969B]].  Both probes were lost in launch-related complications with the newly developed Proton rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/chronology_mars.html | title= NASA A Chronology of Mars Exploration | accessdate=2007-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====1970s=====
The USSR intended to have the first artificial satellite of Mars beating the planned American [[Mariner 8]] and [[Mariner 9]] Mars orbiters. In May 1971, one day after Mariner 8 malfunctioned at launch and failed to reach orbit, [[Kosmos 419|Cosmos 419 (Mars 1971C)]], a heavy probe of the Soviet Mars program M-71, also failed to launch. This spacecraft was designed as an orbiter only, while the next two probes of project M-71, [[Mars 2]] and [[Mars 3]], were multipurpose combinations of an orbiter and a lander with small skis-walking [[rover (space exploration)|rover]]s that would be the first planet rovers outside the Moon. They were successfully launched in mid-May 1971 and reached Mars about seven months later. On November 27, 1971 the lander of Mars 2 [[Emergency landing|crash-landed]] due to an on-board computer malfunction and became the first man-made object to reach the surface of Mars. On 2 December 1971, the Mars 3 lander became the first spacecraft to achieve a [[Soft landing (rocketry)|soft landing]], but its transmission was interrupted after 14.5 seconds.&lt;ref name=Perminov1&gt;{{cite book|last=Perminov|first=V.G.|title=The Difficult Road to Mars – A Brief History of Mars Exploration in the Soviet Union|year=July 1999|publisher=NASA Headquarters History Division|isbn=978-0-16-058859-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/difficultroadtom00perm/page/58 58]|url=https://archive.org/details/difficultroadtom00perm/page/58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mars 2 and 3 orbiters sent back a relatively large volume of data covering the period from December 1971 to March 1972, although transmissions continued through to August. By 22 August 1972, after sending back data and a total of 60 pictures, Mars 2 and 3 concluded their missions. The images and data enabled creation of surface relief maps, and gave information on the Martian [[gravity]] and [[magnetic fields]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1971-049A | title= NASA (NSSDC) Master Catalog Display Mars 3 | accessdate=2007-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the Soviet Union sent four more probes to Mars: the [[Mars program#Mars 4|Mars 4]] and [[Mars program#Mars 5|Mars 5]] orbiters and the [[Mars program#Mars 6|Mars 6]] and [[Mars program#Mars 7|Mars 7]] flyby/lander combinations. All missions except Mars 7 sent back data, with Mars 5 being most successful. Mars 5 transmitted just 60 images before a loss of pressurization in the transmitter housing ended the mission. Mars 6 lander transmitted data during descent, but failed upon impact. Mars 4 flew by the planet at a range of 2200&amp;nbsp;km returning one swath of pictures and radio [[occultation]] data, which constituted the first detection of the nightside [[ionosphere]] on Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1973-047A | title= NASA (NSSDC) Master Catalog Display Mars 4 | accessdate=2007-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mars 7 probe separated prematurely from the carrying vehicle due to a problem in the operation of one of the onboard systems ([[attitude control]] or retro-rockets) and missed the planet by {{convert|1300|km|au}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

====Mariner program====
{{Main|Mariner program|Mariner 4|Mariner 6 and 7|Mariner 9}}
[[File:Mars (Mariner 4).jpg|thumb|150px|The first close-up images taken of Mars in 1965 from Mariner 4 show an area about 330 km across by 1200 km from limb to bottom of frame.]]

In 1964, [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] made two attempts at reaching Mars. [[Mariner 3]] and [[Mariner 4]] were identical spacecraft designed to carry out the first flybys of Mars. Mariner 3 was launched on November 5, 1964, but the shroud encasing the spacecraft atop its rocket failed to open properly, dooming the mission. Three weeks later, on November 28, 1964, Mariner 4 was launched successfully on a 7½-month voyage to Mars..{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Mariner 4 flew past Mars on July 14, 1965, providing the first close-up photographs of another planet. The pictures, gradually played back to Earth from a small tape recorder on the probe, showed impact craters.  It provided radically more accurate data about the planet; a surface [[atmospheric pressure]] of about 1% of Earth's and daytime temperatures of −100&amp;nbsp;°C (−148&amp;nbsp;°F) were estimated.

[[File:Mars m04 11e.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Mariner (crater)|Mariner Crater]], as seen by Mariner 4.  The location is [[Phaethontis quadrangle]].]]
NASA continued the Mariner program with another pair of Mars flyby probes, [[Mariner 6 and 7]]. They were sent at the next launch window, and reached the planet in 1969. During the following launch window the Mariner program again suffered the loss of one of a pair of probes. [[Mariner 9]] successfully entered orbit about Mars, the first spacecraft ever to do so, after the launch time failure of its sister ship, [[Mariner 8]].  When Mariner 9 reached Mars in 1971, it and two Soviet orbiters ([[Mars 2]] and [[Mars 3]], see ''Mars probe program'' above) found that a planet-wide dust storm was in progress.  The mission controllers used the time spent waiting for the storm to clear to have the probe rendezvous with, and photograph, [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]].  When the storm cleared sufficiently for Mars' surface to be photographed by Mariner 9, the pictures returned represented a substantial advance over previous missions.  These pictures were the first to offer more detailed evidence that liquid water might at one time have flowed on the planetary surface. They also finally discerned the true nature of many Martian albedo features. For example, Nix Olympica was one of only a few features that could be seen during the planetary duststorm, revealing it to be the [[List of tallest mountains in the Solar System|highest mountain]] ([[volcano]], to be exact) on any planet in the entire [[Solar System]], and leading to its reclassification as [[Olympus Mons]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

====Viking program====

After the 1992 failure of NASA's [[Mars Observer]] orbiter, NASA retooled and launched [[Mars Global Surveyor]] (MGS).  Mars Global Surveyor launched on November 7, 1996, and entered orbit on September 12, 1997. After a year and a half trimming its orbit from a looping ellipse to a circular track around the planet, the spacecraft began its primary mapping mission in March 1999. It observed the planet from a low-altitude, nearly [[polar orbit]] over the course of one complete Martian year, the equivalent of nearly two Earth years. Mars Global Surveyor completed its primary mission on January 31, 2001, and completed several extended mission phases.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The mission studied the entire Martian surface, atmosphere, and interior, and returned more data about the red planet than all previous Mars missions combined. The data has been archived and remains available publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mgs/ | title=PDS Geosciences Node Data and Services: MGS | accessdate=2006-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Map location is in [[Lunae Palus quadrangle]] and includes parts of Lunae Planum and [[Chryse Planitia]].|A color-coded elevation map produced from data collected by Mars Global Surveyor indicating the result of floods on Mars.]]
Among key scientific findings, Global Surveyor took pictures of gullies and debris flow features that suggest there may be current sources of liquid water, similar to an [[aquifer]], at or near the surface of the planet.  Similar channels on Earth are formed by flowing water, but on Mars the temperature is normally too cold and the atmosphere too thin to sustain liquid water. Nevertheless, many scientists hypothesize that liquid groundwater can sometimes surface on Mars, erode gullies and channels, and pool at the bottom before freezing and evaporating.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

[[Magnetometer]] readings showed that the planet's [[magnetic field]] is not globally generated in the planet's core, but is localized in particular areas of the crust. New temperature data and closeup images of the Martian moon Phobos showed that its surface is composed of powdery material at least 1 metre (3&amp;nbsp;feet) thick, caused by millions of years of meteoroid impacts. Data from the spacecraft's [[laser]] [[altimeter]] gave scientists their first 3-D views of Mars' north polar ice cap.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Faulty software uploaded to the vehicle in June 2006 caused the spacecraft to orient its solar panels incorrectly several months later, resulting in battery overheating and subsequent failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-error-caused-mars-g/|title=Human Error Caused Mars Global Surveyor Failure|author= Minkel, JR| accessdate=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 5, 2006 MGS lost contact with Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/061121_mgs_update.html|title=Mars Global Surveyor Remains Silent, Feared Lost|author=David, Leonard | accessdate=2007-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NASA ended efforts to restore communication on January 28, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/mission/mgs_white_paper_20070413.pdf|title=Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Spacecraft Loss of Contact|author=Mars Global Surveyor Operations Review Board|accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, NASA's [[Mars Odyssey]] orbiter arrived at Mars. Its mission is to use [[spectrometer]]s and imagers to hunt for evidence of past or present [[water]] and volcanic activity on Mars. In 2002, it was announced that the probe's [[gamma-ray spectrometer]] and [[neutron]] spectrometer had detected large amounts of [[hydrogen]], indicating that there are vast deposits of water ice in the upper three meters of Mars' soil within 60° latitude of the south pole.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

On June 2, 2003, the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Mars Express]] set off from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] to Mars. The Mars Express craft consists of the [[Mars Express Orbiter]] and the stationary lander [[Beagle 2]]. The lander carried a digging device and the smallest mass [[spectrometer]] created to date, as well as a range of other devices, on a robotic arm in order to accurately analyze soil beneath the dusty surface to look for [[biosignature]]s and [[biomolecule]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The orbiter entered Mars orbit on December 25, 2003, and Beagle 2 entered Mars' atmosphere the same day. However, attempts to contact the lander failed. Communications attempts continued throughout January, but Beagle 2 was declared lost in mid-February, and a joint inquiry was launched by the UK and ESA. The Mars Express Orbiter confirmed the presence of water ice and carbon dioxide ice at the planet's south pole, while NASA had previously confirmed their presence at the north pole of Mars.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The lander's fate remained a mystery until it was located intact on the surface of Mars in a series of images from the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20150116"&gt;{{cite web |last=Webster |first=Guy |title='Lost' 2003 Mars Lander Found by Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter |url=http://www.nasa.gov/jpl/lost-2003-mars-lander-found-by-mars-reconnaissance-orbiter/ |date=16 January 2015 |website=[[NASA]] |accessdate=16 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150116"&gt;{{cite news |agency=[[Associated Press]] |title=Mars Orbiter Spots Beagle 2, European Lander Missing Since 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/17/science/space/missing-lander-beagle-2-finally-located-on-mars.html |date=16 January 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2015-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images suggest that two of the spacecraft's four [[solar panel]]s failed to deploy, blocking the spacecraft's communications antenna.

[[File:Mars from Phoenix.jpg|thumb|Polar surface as seen by the ''Phoenix'' lander.]]
NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Mission (MER), started in 2003, was a robotic space mission involving two rovers, Spirit (MER-A) and Opportunity, (MER-B) that explored the Martian surface geology.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The mission's scientific objective was to search for and characterize a wide range of rocks and soils that hold clues to past water activity on Mars. The mission was part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, which includes three previous successful landers: the two Viking program landers in 1976; and Mars Pathfinder probe in 1997.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter'' (MRO) is a multipurpose spacecraft designed to conduct [[reconnaissance]] and exploration of Mars from orbit. The US$720 million spacecraft was built by [[Lockheed Martin]] under the supervision of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], launched August 12, 2005, and entered Mars orbit on March 10, 2006.&lt;ref name="spaceflightnow1"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://spaceflightnow.com/mars/mro/status.html| title="Spaceflight Now" MRO Mission Status Center| accessdate =23 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MRO contains a host of scientific instruments such as the [[HiRISE]] camera, CTX camera, CRISM, and [[SHARAD]]. The HiRISE camera is used to analyze Martian landforms, whereas CRISM and SHARAD can detect [[water]], [[ice]], and [[minerals]] on and below the surface.  Additionally, MRO is paving the way for upcoming generations of spacecraft through daily monitoring of Martian weather and surface conditions, searching for future landing sites, and testing a new telecommunications system that enable it to send and receive information at an unprecedented [[bitrate]], compared to previous Mars spacecraft. [[Data transfer]] to and from the spacecraft occurs faster than all previous interplanetary missions combined and allows it to serve as an important relay satellite for other missions.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Human mission proposals==
[[File:Mars-manned-mission-NASA-V5.jpg|thumb|400px|Concept for NASA Design Reference Mission Architecture 5.0 (2009).]]
{{Main|Human mission to Mars}}
The human exploration of Mars has been an aspiration since the earliest days of modern rocketry; [[Robert H. Goddard]] credits the idea of reaching Mars as his own inspiration to study the physics and engineering of space flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stern |first1=David |title=Robert Goddard and His Rockets |url=https://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Sgoddard.htm |publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center |accessdate=21 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Proposals for human exploration of Mars have been made [[Human mission to Mars#20th century|throughout the history of space exploration]]; currently there are multiple active plans and programs to put humans on Mars within the next ten to thirty years, both governmental and private, some of which are listed below.

===NASA===
[[File:Descend on Mars.jpg|thumb|Artistic simulated photo looking out a portal spacecraft coming for a Mars landing.]]
Human exploration by the United States was identified as a long-term goal in the [[Vision for Space Exploration]] announced in 2004 by then US President [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref name=britt_bush_vision/&gt; The planned ''[[Orion (Constellation program)|Orion]]'' spacecraft would be used to send a human expedition to Earth's moon by 2020 as a stepping stone to a Mars expedition. On September 28, 2007, NASA administrator [[Michael D. Griffin]] stated that NASA aims to put a person on Mars by 2037.&lt;ref name=mars_daily/&gt;

On December 2, 2014, NASA's Advanced Human Exploration Systems and Operations Mission Director Jason Crusan and Deputy Associate Administrator for Programs James Reuthner announced tentative support for the [[Boeing]] "Affordable Mars Mission Design" including radiation shielding, centrifugal artificial gravity, in-transit consumable resupply, and a lander which can return.&lt;ref&gt;K.Klaus, M. L. Raftery and K. E. Post (2014) [http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2014/eposter/2258 "An Affordable Mars Mission Design"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507235406/http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2014/eposter/2258 |date=2015-05-07 }} (Houston, Texas: Boeing Co.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. L. Raftery (May 14, 2014) [https://www.dropbox.com/s/0gagd1dbyptnvwg/Raftery_05-14-14.pdf "Mission to Mars in Six (not so easy) Pieces"]  (Houston, Texas: Boeing Co.)&lt;/ref&gt; Reuthner suggested that if adequate funding was forthcoming, the proposed mission would be expected in the early 2030s.&lt;ref&gt;NASA (December 2, 2014) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBoj-1m-qLU "NASA’s Journey to Mars News Briefing"] ''NASA TV''&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 2015, [[NASA]] published its official plan for human exploration and colonization of Mars. They called it "Journey to Mars". The plan operates through three distinct phases leading up to fully sustained colonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NASA Releases Plan Outlining Next Steps in the Journey to Mars|url = http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-releases-plan-outlining-next-steps-in-the-journey-to-mars|website = NASA|accessdate = 2015-10-12|first = Erin|last = Mahoney|date = 2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first stage, already underway, is the "Earth Reliant" phase.  This phase continues utilizing the [[International Space Station]] until 2024; validating deep space technologies and studying the effects of long duration space missions on the human body.  
* The second stage, "Proving Ground," moves away from Earth reliance and ventures into [[cislunar space]] for most of its tasks.  This is when NASA plans to capture an asteroid (planned for 2020), test deep space habitation facilities, and validate capabilities required for human exploration of Mars.  Finally, phase three is the transition to independence from Earth resources.  
* The last stage, the "Earth Independent" phase, includes long term missions on the lunar surface which leverage surface habitats that only require routine maintenance, and the harvesting of Martian resources for fuel, water, and building materials.  NASA is still aiming for human missions to Mars in the 2030s, though Earth independence could take decades longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/journey-to-mars-next-steps-20151008_508.pdf|title = NASA's Journey To Mars: Pioneering Next Steps in Space Exploration|date = October 8, 2015|accessdate = October 10, 2015|website = www.nasa.gov|publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 28, 2015, NASA funded a year long simulation to study the effects of a year long Mars mission on six scientists. The scientists lived in a bio dome on a Mauna Loa mountain in Hawaii with limited connection to the outside world and were only allowed outside if they were wearing spacesuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/28/health/mars-simulation-hawaii/index.html|title=Mars simulation crew 'return to Earth' after 365 days in isolation|author=James Griffiths|website=CNN|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/28/mars-scientists-nasa-dome-hawaii-mountain-isolation|title=Mars scientists leave dome on Hawaii mountain after year in isolation|last=Slawson|first=Nicola|date=2016-08-28|last2=agencies|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASAs human Mars exploration plans have evolved through the NASA [[Mars Design Reference Mission]]s, a series of design studies for human exploration of Mars.

In 2017 the focus of NASA shifted to a return to the Moon by 2024 with the [[Artemis program]], a flight to Mars could follow after this project.

===SpaceX===
The long-term goal of the private corporation [[SpaceX]] is the establishment of routine flights to Mars to enable colonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kenneth Chang |title=Elon Musk's Plan: Get Humans to Mars, and Beyond |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/science/elon-musk-spacex-mars-exploration.html |date=September 27, 2016 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=September 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2017presentation"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://relayto.com/spacex/JNQ6SBFX/slides|title=Making Life Multi-planetary - RELAYTO/|last=|first=|date=2018|website=RELAYTO/|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=2019-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musks-started-spacex-because-he-wanted-to-put-life-on-another-planet-2013-3|title=Elon Musk Decided To Put Life On Mars Because NASA Wasn't Serious Enough|first=Alyson|last=Shontell|date=|website=Business Insider|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, the company is developing [[SpaceX Starship|Starship]], a spacecraft capable of crew transportation to Mars and other celestial bodies, along with its booster [[Super Heavy (rocket)|Super Heavy]].

===Zubrin===
[[Mars Direct]], a low-cost human mission proposed by [[Robert Zubrin]], founder of the [[Mars Society]], would use heavy-lift [[Saturn V]] class rockets, such as the [[Ares V]], to skip orbital construction, LEO rendezvous, and lunar fuel depots.

Two Soviet probes were sent to Mars in 1988 as part of the [[Phobos program]]. [[Phobos 1]] operated normally until an expected communications session on 2 September 1988 failed to occur. The problem was traced to a software error, which deactivated attitude thrusters causing the spacecrafts' solar arrays to no longer point at the Sun, depleting Phobos 1 batteries. [[Phobos 2]] operated normally throughout its cruise and Mars orbital insertion phases on January 29, 1989, gathering data on the Sun, interplanetary medium, Mars, and Phobos. Shortly before the final phase of the mission – during which the spacecraft was to approach within 50 m of Phobos' surface and release two landers, one a mobile 'hopper', the other a stationary platform – contact with Phobos 2 was lost. The mission ended when the spacecraft signal failed to be successfully reacquired on March 27, 1989. The cause of the failure was determined to be a malfunction of the on-board computer.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Just a few years later in 1992 [[Mars Observer]], launched by NASA, failed as it approached Mars. [[Mars 96]], an orbiter launched on November 16, 1996 by Russia failed, when the planned second burn of the Block D-2 fourth stage did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Igor Lissov, with comments from Jim Oberg |title=What Really Happened With Mars-96? |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |url=http://www.fas.org/spp/eprint/mars96lo.htm |date=1996-09-19 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of Global Surveyor and Pathfinder, another spate of failures occurred in 1998 and 1999, with the Japanese [[Nozomi (probe)|Nozomi]] orbiter and NASA's [[Mars Climate Orbiter]], [[Mars Polar Lander]], and [[Deep Space 2]] penetrators all suffering various fatal errors. The Mars Climate Orbiter was noted for mixing up [[U.S. customary units]] with [[metric system|metric units]], causing the orbiter to burn up while entering Mars' atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/space/9909/30/mars.metric.02/index.html|title=CNN – Metric mishap caused loss of NASA orbiter – September 30, 1999|website=cnn.com|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Space Agency]] has also attempted to land two probes on the Martian surface; [[Beagle 2]], a British-built lander that failed to deploy its solar arrays properly after touchdown in December 2003, and [[Schiaparelli EDM lander|''Schiaparelli'']], which was flown along the [[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]].
