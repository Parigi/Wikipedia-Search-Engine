'''Apple Store''' is a chain of [[Retail|retail stores]] owned and operated by [[Apple Inc.]] The stores sell various Apple products, including [[Macintosh|Mac]] personal computers, [[iPhone]] smartphones, [[iPad]] tablet computers, [[iPod]] portable media players, [[Apple Watch]] smartwatches, [[Apple TV]] digital media players, [[software]], and selected third-party accessories.

The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-[[CEO]] [[Steve Jobs]], after years of attempting but failing [[store-within-a-store]] concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired [[Ron Johnson (businessman)|Ron Johnson]] in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, by passing the sales numbers of competing for nearby stores and within three years reached [[United States dollar|US$]]1&amp;nbsp;billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so. Over the years, Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage, with 506&amp;nbsp;stores across 25&amp;nbsp;countries worldwide as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/retail/storelist/|title=Apple Retail Store - Store List|website=Apple|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16&amp;nbsp;billion globally in 2011.

In May 2016, [[Angela Ahrendts]], Apple's then-Senior Vice President of Retail, unveiled a significantly redesigned Apple Store in [[Union Square, San Francisco]], featuring large glass doors for the entry, open spaces, and rebranded rooms. In addition to purchasing products, consumers can get advice and help from "Creative Pros" – individuals with specialized knowledge of creative arts; get product support in a tree-lined Genius Grove; and attend sessions, conferences, and community events, with Ahrendts commenting that the goal is to make Apple Stores into "town squares", a place where people naturally meet up and spend time. The new design will be applied to all Apple Stores worldwide, a process that has seen stores temporarily relocate or close.

Many Apple Stores are located inside shopping malls, but Apple has built several stand-alone [[flagship]] stores in high-profile locations. It has been granted design [[patent]]s and received architectural awards for its stores' designs and construction, specifically for its use of glass staircases and cubes. The success of Apple Stores has had significant influence over other consumer electronics retailers, who have lost traffic, control and profits due to perceived higher quality of service and products at Apple Stores. Apple's notable [[Apple Inc.#Brand loyalty|brand loyalty]] among consumers causes long lines of hundreds of people at new Apple Store openings or product releases. Due to the popularity of the brand, Apple receives many job applications, many of which come from young workers. Apple Store employees receive above-average pay, are offered money toward education and health care, and receive product discounts; however, there are limited or no paths of career advancement. A May 2016 report with an anonymous retail employee highlighted a [[hostile work environment]] with harassment from customers, intense internal criticism, and a lack of significant bonuses for securing major business contracts.

===Third-party retail===
[[Steve Jobs]], co-founder of Apple, returned to the company as interim CEO in 1997. According to his biographer [[Walter Isaacson]], Jobs began a concerted campaign to help sales by improving the retail presentation of Macintosh computers. Even with new products launched under his watch, like the [[iMac G3|iMac]] and the [[PowerBook G3]] and an online store, Apple still relied heavily on big-box computer and electronics stores for most of its sales. There, customers continued to deal with poorly trained and ill-maintained Mac sections that did not foster customer loyalty to Apple and did not help differentiate the Mac user experience from Windows.&lt;ref name="roots"&gt;{{cite web |first=Tom |last=Hormby |title=The Roots of Apple's Retail Stores |url=http://lowendmac.com/2008/the-roots-of-apples-retail-stores/ |website=LowEndMac |date=May 19, 2008 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="together again"&gt;{{cite web |first=Janet |last=Meyer |title=Best Buy and Apple Together Again |url=http://www.applematters.com/article/best-buy-and-apple-together-again/ |website=Apple Matters |date=June 27, 2006 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the retailer trend was towards selling their own generic in-house brand PCs which used even cheaper components than those by major PC makers, increasing retailer overall margins by keeping the manufacturing profits. This "provided a powerful profit motive to convert customers interested in buying a Mac into the owners of a new, cheaply assembled, house brand PC".&lt;ref name="retail challenge"&gt;{{cite web |first=Daniel |last=Eran |title=Apple's Retail Challenge |url=http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Q4.06/1DDD598A-7CE0-479E-A6F9-912777CAB484.html |website=Roughly Drafted |date=November 8, 2006 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Cook]], who joined Apple in 1998 as Senior Vice President for Worldwide Operations, announced the company would "cut some channel partners that may not be providing the buying experience [Apple expects]. We're not happy with everybody." Jobs severed Apple's ties with every big box retailer, including Sears, Montgomery Ward, Best Buy, Circuit City, Computer City, and Office Max to focus its retail efforts with CompUSA. Between 1997 and 2000, the number of Mac authorized resellers dropped from 20,000 to just 11,000. The majority of these were cuts made by Apple itself. Jobs proclaimed that Apple would be targeting [[Dell]] as a competitor, with Cook's mandate to match or exceed Dell's lean inventories and streamlined supply chain. Jobs made an open statement to [[Michael Dell]], "with our new products and our new store and our new build-to-order, we're coming after you, buddy." While Dell had operated as direct mail order and online order company, having pulled out of retailers to realize greater profit margins and efficiency, Apple had direct orders with sales handled by its channel partners, other mail order resellers, independent dealerships, and the new relationship with CompUSA to build "stores within a store".&lt;ref name="retail challenge"/&gt;

Jobs did a study for stand-alone "store within a store" for 34 sites in Japan. These sites were designed by Eight Inc. and CEO Tim Kobe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hivelife.com/tim-kobe/|title=Tim Kobe Designed the First Apple Store. He Predicts the Future of Asian Retail|date=July 22, 2019|website=Hive Life Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was designing the Apple MacWorld and product launch events with Apple. [[CompUSA]] was one of the few retailers that kept its Apple contract by agreeing to adopt Apple's "store within a store" concept designed by Eight Inc. This required that approximately 15% of each CompUSA store would be set aside for Mac hardware and software (including non-Apple products) and would play host to a part-time Apple salesperson. However, the "store within a store" approach did not meet expectations, in part because the Apple section was in the lowest-traffic area of CompUSA stores. CompUSA president Jim Halpin, who proclaimed that he would make Apple products his top priority, was forced to resign a year later. Also, CompUSA had trouble finding well-trained staff, as most store clerks usually steered customers away from Macs and towards Windows PCs. Through these setbacks, CompUSA sales of Macs had increased. Apple then added [[Best Buy]] as a second authorized reseller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Pogue |title=Desktop Critic: CompUSA: Apple's Not-So-Superstore |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1014845/desktopcritic.html |website=[[Macworld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=March 1, 1999 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Challenges still remained, as resellers' profit margins on selling Macs was only around 9%, and selling Macs was only worthwhile if ongoing service and support contracts were provided, of which retailer experiences were inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Q4.06/1DDD598A-7CE0-479E-A6F9-912777CAB484.html|title=Apple's Retail Challenge|publisher=|accessdate=July 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Online store ====
In 1997, the year Steve Jobs returned to Apple, [[Dell]] founder and CEO [[Michael Dell]] were asked how he would fix Apple. Dell responded: "I'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders". This angered Jobs, due to Dell's success with its online store originally built by [[NeXT]], his former business that Apple acquired to bring Jobs back. A team of Apple and NeXT employees spent several months building an online store that would be better than Dell's. On November 10, 1997, Steve Jobs announced the online store at an Apple press event, and during his keynote speech, he said: "I guess what we want to tell you, Michael, is that with our new products and our new store and our new build-to-order manufacturing, we're coming after you, buddy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Seth |last=Fiegerman |title=The Slow Evolution of Apple's Online Store |url=http://mashable.com/2014/05/16/apple-online-store-history/ |website=[[Mashable]] |date=May 16, 2014 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, Apple revamped the online storefront, removing the dedicated "Store" tab and making the entire website a retail experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Panzarino |title=Apple.com, One Of The World's Biggest Stores, Gets A Redesign |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/06/apple-com-removes-standalone-store-tab-emphasizes-curation-in-huge-redesign/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=August 6, 2015 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mariella |last=Moon |title=Apple's website redesign kills separate 'Store' section |url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/08/06/apples-website-store-death/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=August 6, 2015 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
Jobs believed the Apple retail program needed to fundamentally change the relationship to the customer, and provide more control over the presentation of Apple products and the Apple brand message. Jobs recognized the limitations of third-party retailing and began investigating options to change the model.&lt;ref name="MacRumors stores"/&gt;

In 1999, Jobs personally recruited [[Millard Drexler]], former CEO of [[Gap Inc.]], to serve on Apple's board of directors.&lt;ref name="MacRumors stores"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Longtime Apple Board Member Mickey Drexler to Retire in March |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2015/01/22/mickey-drexler-to-retire/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=January 22, 2015 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rita |last=Warkov |title=Steve Jobs and Mickey Drexler: A Tale of Two Retailers |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/47520270 |website=[[CNBC]] |publisher=[[NBCUniversal News Group]] |date=May 22, 2012 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Jobs hired [[Ron Johnson (businessman)|Ron Johnson]] from [[Target Corporation|Target]]. The retail and development teams headed by Allen Moyer from [[The Walt Disney Company]] then began a series of mock-ups for the Apple Store inside a warehouse near the company's Cupertino headquarters.&lt;ref name="MacRumors stores"/&gt;

On May 15, 2001, Jobs hosted a press event at Apple's first store, located at the [[Tysons Corner Center]] mall in [[Tysons, Virginia]] near [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="First store"&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple to Open 25 Retail Stores in 2001 |url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2001/05/15Apple-to-Open-25-Retail-Stores-in-2001.html |website=Apple Press Info |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |date=May 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The store officially opened on May 19, along with another store in [[Glendale Galleria]] in [[Glendale, California]].&lt;ref name="First store"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacRumors stores"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Lisa |last=Eadicicco |title=Watch Steve Jobs Introduce the First Apple Store |url=http://time.com/4339922/steve-jobs-first-apple-store-video/ |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=May 19, 2016 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 7,700 people visited Apple's first two stores in the opening weekend, spending a total of {{US$|599,000}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Benj |last=Edwards |title=A tale of two Apple Stores (the first two) |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1159817/computers/first2applestores.html |website=[[Macworld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=May 19, 2011 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion ===
Several publications and analysts predicted the failure of Apple Stores. However, the Apple retail program established its merits, bypassing the sales-per-square-foot measurement of competing nearby stores, and in 2004 reached $1 billion in annual sales, the fastest of any retailer in history. Sales continued to grow, reaching $1 billion a quarter by 2006. Then-CEO [[Steve Jobs]] said that "People haven't been willing to invest this much time and money or engineering in a store before", adding that "It's not important if the customer knows that. They just feel it. They feel something's a little different."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jerry |last=Useem |title=Apple: America's best retailer |url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/03/19/8402321/index.htm |website=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |date=March 8, 2007 |accessdate=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Apple Stores in the United States had an average revenue of $473,000 for each employee.&lt;ref name="retail army"/&gt; According to research firm RetailSails, the Apple Store chain ranked first among U.S. retailers in terms of [[sales per unit area]] in 2011, almost doubling [[Tiffany &amp; Co.|Tiffany]], the second retailer on the list.&lt;ref name="retail army"/&gt; On a global level, all Apple Stores had a combined revenue of US$16&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="retail army"/&gt; Under the leadership of [[Ron Johnson (businessman)|Ron Johnson]], the former senior Vice President of Retail Operations, the Apple Stores have, according to an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', been responsible for "[turning] the boring computer sales floor into a sleek playroom filled with gadgets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Stephanie |last1=Clifford |first2=Miguel |last2=Helft |title=Apple Stores Chief to Take the Helm at J.C.

Apple has since re-established ties with major big box retailers like [[Best Buy]] and [[Staples Inc.|Staples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mark |last=Gurman |title=Apple to expand iPad's reach with Staples deal next month |url=https://9to5mac.com/2013/09/26/apple-to-expand-ipads-reach-with-staples-deal-next-month/ |website=9to5Mac |date=September 26, 2013 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorized Apple resellers have a dedicated [[store-within-a-store]] section, offering a distinctive Apple-style experience to showcase products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Hollie |last=Shaw |title=Best Buy Canada looking to become ground zero in Windows, Apple, Samsung electronics battle |url=http://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/best-buy-looking-to-become-ground-zero-in-windows-apple-samsung-electronics-battle |website=[[National Post]] |publisher=[[Postmedia Network]] |date=October 23, 2013 |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship with Best Buy calls for the company to send Apple Solutions Consultants (ASCs) to train Best Buy employees to be familiar with Apple's product lineup.&lt;ref name="together again"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Bangeman |title=Apple throwing its weight into Best Buy Mac sales? |url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/06/7129-2/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=June 25, 2006 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence ===
Apple Stores have considerably changed the landscape for consumer electronics retailers and influenced other technological companies to follow suit. According to ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', "Apple’s retail stores have taken traffic, control and profits away from [[Verizon Wireless|Verizon]] as well as electronics retailers, such as [[Best Buy]], that once looked at wireless phones as a lucrative profit source".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephen D. |last=Simpson |title=How Apple's fortunes affect other stocks |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/how-apples-fortunes-affect-other-stocks/article4596866/ |website=[[The Globe and Mail]] |publisher=[[The Woodbridge Company]] |date=October 8, 2012 |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[CNET]]'' has reported that the "Apple retail experience hurts Best Buy" and noted, "Buy a [[MacBook]] at the Apple Store and it's hard to go back to the Best Buy Windows laptop buying experience". The publication also wrote that "Apple salespeople are generally more knowledgeable, the products themselves are generally higher quality, and the stores are more appealing, aesthetically and practically."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brooke |last=Crothers |title=Is Best Buy following CompUSA, Circuit City to certain doom? |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/is-best-buy-following-compusa-circuit-city-to-certain-doom/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=March 29, 2012 |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, reports surfaced that Steve Jobs and his retail team would help "drastically overhaul" [[Disney Store]]s. His involvement was described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "particularly notable", given his work on the "highly successful" Apple Stores and his election to Disney's board of directors in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brooks |last=Barnes |title=Disney's Retail Plan Is a Theme Park in Its Stores |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/13/business/media/13disney.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 12, 2009 |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Scott |last=McNulty |title=NYT: Apple inspiring new Disney retail strategy |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1143263/disney_retail.html |website=[[Macworld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=October 12, 2009 |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' reported that Apple's first store in the United Kingdom, at [[Regent Street]], was the most profitable shop of its size in London, with the highest sales per square foot, taking in £60&amp;nbsp;million a year, or £2,000 per square foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple store most profitable shop in London for its size |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/apple-store-most-profitable-shop-in-london-for-its-size-6707808.html |website=[[London Evening Standard]] |date=August 28, 2009 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other electronics retailers from around the world such as Huawei, Samsung, Xiaomi started to follow the designing trend of Apple Store.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

=== Redesign ===
[[File:Apple Store San Francisco Union Square Store Interior 201605.jpg|thumb|The Genius Grove at [[Union Square, San Francisco]] after renovation in May 2016.]]
[[File:Apple_Holiday_Plaza_Shenzhen_featuring_Video_Wall.jpg|thumb|Video wall]]
In May 2016, Apple significantly redesigned its Union Square Apple Store in downtown [[San Francisco]], adding large glass doors for the entry, open spaces with touch-sensitive tables and shelves for product displays, and rebranded rooms for the store. "The Avenue" is the central location for hardware, as well as for receiving advice from salespersons and "Creative Pros" with specialized knowledge of music, photography, creativity, and apps. The "Genius Bar" becomes the "Genius Grove", a tree-lined area for help and support. "The Forum" features a large video screen and offers game nights, sessions with experts in creative arts, and community events. "The Plaza", while limited to select locations, offers a "park-like" space outside the store featuring free 24/7 [[Wi-Fi]] access and will host live concerts on some weekends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alex |last=Webb |title=Inside the New Apple Retail Store Design |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-19/why-apple-is-building-a-town-inside-its-stores |website=Bloomberg Technology |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=May 19, 2016 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Statt |title=Apple just revealed the future of its retail stores |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/19/11715726/apple-flagship-store-opening-san-francisco-photos |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=May 19, 2016 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by [[Jony Ive]] and [[Angela Ahrendts]], the idea was to make Apple Stores into "town squares", in which people come naturally to the store as a gathering place,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Avery |last=Hartmans |title=Apple's retail boss wants Apple stores to resemble 'town squares' |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/angela-ahrendts-apple-stores-social-2016-8 |website=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]] |date=August 19, 2016 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to "help foster human experiences that draw people out of their digital bubbles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mike |last=Wuerthele |title=Angela Ahrendts interview addresses Apple retail refurb, town square concept successes |url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/10/18/angela-ahrendts-interview-addresses-apple-retail-refurb-town-square-concept-successes |website=AppleInsider |date=October 18, 2016 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new design will be adopted to every store Apple has,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Angela Ahrendts talks Apple store makeover, why Tim Cook hired her |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/angela-ahrendts-apple-svp-of-retail-redesign-today-at-apple/ |website=[[CBS News]] |publisher=[[CBS]] |date=April 25, 2017 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and while renovation is undergoing, stores are either relocated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Rossignol |title=Apple Opening Three Next-Generation Stores Over the Next Week |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2016/08/19/next-gen-apple-stores-glasglow-kc-annapolis/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=August 19, 2016 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or temporarily closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Rossignol |title=Apple Retail Update: Danbury Store Closes for Next-Generation Redesign, Dubai to Get Second Store |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/02/06/apple-store-danbury-dubai-update/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=February 6, 2017 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Apple announced that its "Today at Apple" educational sessions, which launched with its Union Square redesign in 2016 and offer more than 60 free hands-on sessions for creative skills, will also be expanded to all of its stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Rossignol |title='Today at Apple' Sessions About Art, Music, and Coding Expanding to Every Apple Store in May |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/04/25/today-at-apple-sessions-launching-worldwide-may/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=April 25, 2017 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Zac |last=Hall |title=Apple Store expanding new 'Today at Apple' initiative next month, Angela Ahrendts says [Video] |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/04/25/apple-store-angela-ahrendts-interview/ |website=9to5Mac |date=April 25, 2017 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Apple Stores feature a Genius Bar, where customers can receive technical advice or set up service and repair for their products. The Genius Bar provides software support for [[macOS]] and hardware service on products that are not classified vintage or obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304210|title=Official Apple Support|publisher=|accessdate=July 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226113432/http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304210|archive-date=February 26, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in most cases the Geniuses will at least attempt to assist customers with older hardware.&lt;ref name="MacSE"&gt;{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://50lbslater.com/blog/?p=45|title=Old School Genius|publisher=Tech Today|accessdate=October 4, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015013900/http://50lbslater.com/blog/?p=45|archivedate=October 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Apple opened a store at its [[Apple Campus]] in [[Cupertino, California]]. At the time, the store was the only place in the world where Apple merchandise could be purchased, including T-shirts, mugs, and pens.&lt;ref name="mashable-campus-redesign"&gt;{{cite web |first=Karissa |last=Bell |title=Inside Apple's redesigned campus store in Cupertino |url=http://mashable.com/2015/09/19/apple-store-cupertino/ |website=[[Mashable]] |date=September 19, 2015 |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, the store was closed for renovations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jordan |last=Kahn |title=Apple's iconic company store is closing its doors next week for a major redesign |url= https://9to5mac.com/2015/06/02/apple-company-store-closing-redesign/ |website=[[9to5Mac]] |date=June 2, 2015 |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in September it was reopened, offering a new design and, for the first time, selling [[iPhone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Richard |last1=Nieva |first2=Shara |last2=Tibken |title=Apple relaunches campus store – and you can buy an iPhone there now |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-relaunches-campus-store-and-you-can-buy-an-iphone-there-now/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=September 18, 2015 |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mashable-campus-redesign"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Edward |last=Moyer |title=Apple's redesigned campus store (pictures) |url=https://www.cnet.com/pictures/apples-redesigned-campus-store-pictures/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=September 21, 2015 |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apple Store in Iran.JPG|thumb|An unauthorized Apple Store in [[Tehran, Iran]]]]
In July 2011, an American expatriate blogger who lives in the southwestern Chinese city of [[Kunming]] reported on her discovery of what she called "the best ripoff store we had ever seen"—a fake Apple Store, complete with the glass exterior, wood display tables, winding staircase and large promotional posters found in legitimate Apple Stores, and with employees wearing lanyards and the same T-shirts as actual Apple Store employees.&lt;ref name="Ultimate knockoff"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2011/07/21/the-ultimate-knock-off-a-fake-apple-store|title=The Ultimate Knock-Off: A Fake Apple Store|first=Loretta|last=Chao|work=China Real Time Report|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 21, 2011|accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that the store had "gotten widespread international attention for the remarkable lengths to which its proprietors seem to have gone to mimic the look and feel of a real Apple Store."&lt;ref name="Fake clerk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2011/07/21/china-fake-apple-store-clerk-speaks-out|title=Fake Apple Store Clerk Speaks out|first=Loretta|last=Chao|author2=Feng, Sue|work=China Real Time Report|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 21, 2011|accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fake Apple Store was mentioned by U.S. presidential contender [[Mitt Romney]] in the [[United States presidential election debates, 2012#October 16: Second presidential debate (Hofstra University)|second 2012 election debate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2012/10/17/china-fake-apple-store-blogger-romney-misusing-the-story/ |title=Mitt Romney Called Out on Fake Apple Store |last=Mozur |first=Paul |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date= October 17, 2012 |accessdate=April 8, 2014 |quote=“There’s even an Apple store in China that’s a counterfeit Apple store, selling counterfeit goods,” Mr. Romney said in response to a question about the outsourcing of American jobs, according to the transcript debate.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese law prohibits retailers from copying the look and feel of competitors' stores, but enforcement is lax.&lt;ref name="Reuters followup"&gt;{{cite web |first=Melanie |last=Lee |title=Chinese city orders two fake Apple Stores to close |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-china-fake-idUSTRE76O0M720110725 |website=[[Reuters]] |date=July 25, 2011 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Wall Street Journal'', unauthorized Apple resellers are found throughout China; the blogger's original post noted that two such stores were located within walking distance of the first knockoff, one of them with a misspelled sign reading "Apple Stoer".&lt;ref name="Fake clerk"/&gt; An employee of the first knockoff confirmed that the store was not one of the 13&lt;ref name="Reuters followup"/&gt; authorized Apple resellers in Kunming.&lt;ref name="Ultimate knockoff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fake clerk"/&gt; In a follow-up report, [[Reuters]] indicated that local authorities in Kunming had closed two fake Apple Stores in that city due to lack of official business permits, but allowed three other such stores to stay open, including the one that had attracted international attention. The operators of that store had applied for a reseller license from Apple.&lt;ref name="Reuters followup"/&gt; At the time of the report, only four legitimate Apple Stores had opened in China, with two in Beijing and two in Shanghai.&lt;ref name="Fake clerk"/&gt;
