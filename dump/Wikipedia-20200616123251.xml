'''NeXT, Inc.''' (later '''NeXT Computer, Inc.''' and '''NeXT Software, Inc.''') was an American [[computer]] and [[software]] company founded in 1985 by [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]]. Based in [[Redwood City, California]], the company developed and manufactured a series of [[computer workstation]]s intended for the [[higher education]] and business markets. NeXT was founded by Jobs after he was forced out of Apple, along with several co-workers. NeXT introduced the first [[NeXT Computer]] in 1988, and the smaller [[NeXTstation]] in 1990. The NeXT computers experienced relatively limited sales, with estimates of about 50,000 units shipped in total. Nevertheless, their innovative [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] [[NeXTSTEP]] [[operating system]] and [[development environment]] ([[Interface Builder]]) were highly influential.  

The first major outside investment was from [[Ross Perot]], who invested after seeing a segment about NeXT on a 1986 [[PBS]] documentary titled ''Entrepreneurs''.&lt;ref name="RP iPhone"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90374043/how-ross-perot-helped-bring-us-the-iphone|title=How Ross Perot befriended Steve Jobs and helped bring us the iPhone|last=McCracken|first=Harry|date=2019-07-09|website=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191201175217/https://www.fastcompany.com/90374043/how-ross-perot-helped-bring-us-the-iphone|archive-date=December 1, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, he invested $20 million in exchange for 16 percent of NeXT's stock and subsequently joined the board of directors in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff|url-access=registration|title=iCon: Steve Jobs|last=Young|first=Jeffrey S.|last2=Simon|first2=William L.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2005|isbn=0-471-72083-6|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff/page/134 134]|access-date=August 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191023023208/https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff|archive-date=October 23, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NeXT later released much of the NeXTSTEP system as a [[Application programming interface|programming environment]] standard called [[OpenStep]]. NeXT withdrew from the hardware business in 1993 to concentrate on marketing [[OpenStep#OPENSTEP for Mach|OPENSTEP for Mach]], its own OpenStep implementation, for several [[original equipment manufacturer]]s (OEMs). NeXT also developed [[WebObjects]], one of the first enterprise [[Web framework|web application frameworks]]. WebObjects never became very popular because of its initial high price of $50,000, but it remains a prominent early example of a [[Web server]] based on [[Dynamic web page|dynamic page generation]] rather than on [[static content]].

Apple purchased NeXT in 1997 for $429 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|USD|429|1997}} million in {{Inflation-year|USD}}) and 1.5 million shares of Apple stock. The merger converted Steve Jobs from Chairman and CEO of NeXT to an advisory role at Apple, the company he had co-founded in 1976;&lt;ref name="apple-acquisition"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Apple Acquires at Cnet"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-acquires-next-jobs/|title=Apple acquires Next, Jobs|last=Kawamoto|first=Dawn|date=|website=CNET|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200315025703/https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-acquires-next-jobs/|archive-date=15 Mar 2020|access-date=2020-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it promised to port NeXT's operating system to Macintosh hardware, combine it with the legacy application layer of [[Mac OS]], and yield [[OS X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/12/the-legacy-of-next-lives-on-in-os-x/|title=The legacy of NeXT lives on in OS X|last=Foresman|first=Chris|date=2012-12-19|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401090815/https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/12/the-legacy-of-next-lives-on-in-os-x/|archive-date=1 Apr 2020|access-date=2020-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title=Apple Computer, Inc.

==History==

===Background===
In 1985, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs led Apple's SuperMicro division, which was responsible for the development of the [[Macintosh]] and [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] personal computers. The Macintosh had been successful on university campuses partly because of the [[Apple University Consortium]], which allowed students and institutions to buy the computers at a discount.&lt;ref name="The NeXT Big Thing"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780689121357|title=Steve Jobs and the NeXT Big Thing|last=Stross|first=Randall|publisher=Athenium|year=1993|isbn=0-689-12135-0|access-date=August 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190628074925/https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780689121357|archive-date=June 28, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|56,67}} The consortium had earned more than $50 million on computers by February 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Morrison|first=Ann|url=http://fortune.com/1984/02/20/apple-bites-back-fortune-1984/|title=Apple Bites Back|date=February 20, 1984|work=Fortune|access-date=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190609050506/http://fortune.com/1984/02/20/apple-bites-back-fortune-1984/|archive-date=June 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jobs visited university departments and faculty members to sell Macintosh. Jobs met [[Paul Berg]], a Nobel Laureate in chemistry, at a luncheon held in [[Silicon Valley]] to honor [[François Mitterrand]], then [[President of France]].&lt;ref name="The NeXT Big Thing"/&gt;{{rp|72}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Shannon|first=Victoria|title=Apple losing its polish in Franc| work=[[International New York Times|International Herald Tribune]]|page=11|date=May 22, 2006|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/05/21/business/lobbyside.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060602104905/http://iht.com/articles/2006/05/21/business/lobbyside.php|archivedate=June 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berg was frustrated by the expense of teaching students about [[recombinant DNA]] from textbooks instead of in [[Wet laboratory|wet laboratories]], used for the testing and analysis of chemicals, drugs, and other materials or biological matter. Wet labs were prohibitively expensive for lower-level courses and were too complex to be simulated on personal computers of the time. Berg suggested that Jobs should use his influence at Apple to create for higher education a "[[3M computer]]", a term for a workstation with one [[megabyte]] of [[random-access memory]] (RAM), a one-[[Pixel#Megapixel|megapixel]] display, and one [[FLOPS|megaFLOPS]] of CPU performance.

Jobs was intrigued by Berg's concept of a workstation and contemplated starting a higher education computer company in late 1985, amid increasing turmoil at Apple. Jobs's division did not release upgraded versions of the Macintosh and much of the [[Macintosh Office]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Apple's new Mac push; can Apple Computer succeed in wooing big companies with its Macintosh Office?|last=Fuerst|first=Irene|date=1985-03-15|work=Datamation|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, sales plummeted,&lt;ref name="West of Eden"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/westofedenendofi00rose_0/page/193|title=West of Eden|last=Rose|first=Frank|publisher=Viking|year=1990|isbn=0-670-81278-1|access-date=August 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200103205807/https://archive.org/details/westofedenendofi00rose_0/page/193|archive-date=January 3, 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|193}} and Apple was forced to write off millions of dollars in unsold inventory.&lt;ref name="West of Eden"/&gt;{{rp|227}} Apple's [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) [[John Sculley]] ousted Jobs from his day-to-day role at Apple, replacing him with [[Jean-Louis Gassée]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="West of Eden"/&gt;{{rp|291}} Later that year, Jobs began a power struggle to regain control of the company. The [[board of directors]] sided with Sculley while Jobs took a business trip to [[Western Europe]] and the [[Soviet Union]] on behalf of Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff|url-access=registration|title=iCon: Steve Jobs|last=Young|first=Jeffrey S.|last2=Simon|first2=William L.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2005|isbn=0-471-72083-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff/page/118 118]|access-date=August 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191023023208/https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff|archive-date=October 23, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original NeXT team===
After several months of being sidelined, Jobs resigned from Apple on September 13, 1985. He told the board he was leaving to set up a new computer company, and that he would be taking several Apple employees from the SuperMicro division with him. He also told the board that his new company would not compete with Apple and might even consider licensing its designs back to them to market under the Macintosh brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Apple's Jobs Starts New Firm, Targets Education Market|last=Spector|first=G|date=1985-09-24|work=[[eWeek|PC Week]]|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of former Apple employees followed him to NeXT, including [[Joanna Hoffman]], [[Bud Tribble]], [[George Crow]], [[Rich Page]], [[Susan Barnes (computing)|Susan Barnes]], [[Susan Kare]], and Dan'l Lewin. After consulting with major educational buyers from around the country, including a follow-up meeting with Paul Berg, a tentative specification for the workstation was drawn up. It was designed to be powerful enough to run wet lab simulations and cheap enough for college students to use in their dormitory rooms.&lt;ref name="secondcoming"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/secondcomingofst00deut|url-access=registration|title=Second Coming of Steve Jobs|last=Deutschman|first=Alan|publisher=Broadway Books|year=2000|isbn=0-7679-0432-X|pages=[https://archive.org/details/secondcomingofst00deut/page/64 64]|access-date=August 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200103205848/https://archive.org/details/secondcomingofst00deut|archive-date=January 3, 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the specifications were finished, however, Apple sued NeXT for "nefarious schemes" to take advantage of the cofounders' [[Insider|insider information]].&lt;ref name="The NeXT Big Thing"/&gt;{{rp|75}}&lt;ref name="secondcoming"/&gt;{{rp|44}} Jobs remarked, "It is hard to think that a $2 billion company with 4,300-plus people couldn't compete with six people in blue jeans."&lt;ref name="The NeXT Big Thing"/&gt; The suit was eventually dismissed before trial.

In 1986, Jobs recruited the famous graphic designer [[Paul Rand]] to create a brand identity for $100,000.&lt;ref name="rand"/&gt; Jobs recalled, "I asked him if he would come up with a few options, and he said, 'No, I will solve your problem for you and you will pay me. You don’t have to use the solution. If you want options go talk to other people.'"&lt;ref name="NeXT logo by Paul Rand"&gt;{{Cite web | title=NeXT logo by Paul Rand | date=March 29, 2010 | publisher=Logo Design Love | url=https://www.logodesignlove.com/next-logo-paul-rand | accessdate=February 10, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423185315/https://www.logodesignlove.com/next-logo-paul-rand | archive-date=April 23, 2019 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand created a 20-page brochure detailing the brand, including the precise angle used for the logo (28°) and a new company name spelling, NeXT.&lt;ref name="rand"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paul Rand|last=Heller|first=Steven|last2=Helfand|first2=Jessica|last3=Lois|first3=George|publisher=Phaidon Press|year=2000|isbn=0-7148-3994-9|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NeXT changed its business plan in mid-1986. The company decided to develop both computer hardware and software, instead of just a low-end workstation. A team led by [[Avie Tevanian]], who was a [[Mach (kernel)|Mach kernel]] engineer at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], was to develop the NeXTSTEP operating system. The hardware division, led by [[Rich Page]]{{mdash}}one of NeXT's cofounders who had previously led Apple's [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] team{{mdash}}designed and developed the hardware. NeXT's first factory was completed in [[Fremont, California]] in 1987.&lt;ref name="The NeXT Big Thing"/&gt;{{rp|72}} It was capable of producing 150,000 machines per year.&lt;ref name="The NeXT Big Thing"/&gt;{{rp|72}} NeXT's first workstation is officially named the [[NeXT Computer]], nicknamed "the cube"&lt;ref name="byte"/&gt; because of its distinctive magnesium one-foot cube case, designed by [[Apple IIc]] case designer [[Frog Design Inc.|Frogdesign]] in accordance with an edict from Jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The original design team had anticipated completing the computer in early 1987 to be ready for sale for {{US$|3000}} by midyear.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|title=Steve Jobs building NeXT|id=WHsHKzYOV2E}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NeXT Computer received standing ovations when revealed at a lavish, invitation-only gala event, "[[NeXT Introduction]] — the Introduction to the NeXT Generation of Computers for Education" at the [[Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall]], [[San Francisco]], California on October 12, 1988. The following day, selected educators and software developers were invited (for a $100 registration fee) to attend the first public technical overview of the NeXT computer at an event called "The NeXT Day" held at the San Francisco Hilton. This event gave developers interested in developing NeXT software an insight into the software architecture, [[object-oriented programming]], and developing for the NeXT Computer. The luncheon speaker was Steve Jobs.

The first machines were tested in 1989, after which NeXT started selling limited numbers to universities with a [[Software testing#Beta testing|beta]] version of the NeXTSTEP operating system installed. Initially the NeXT Computer was targeted at U.S. [[higher education]] establishments only, with a base price of {{US$|6500|1989}}.&lt;ref name="byte"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Tom|last2=Baran|first2=Nick|date=November 1988|title=The NeXT Computer|url=http://www.simson.net/ref/NeXT/byte_article.htm|journal=[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]|volume=13|issue=12|pages=158–175|access-date=May 14, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405161616/http://www.simson.net/ref/NeXT/byte_article.htm|archive-date=April 5, 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The machine was widely reviewed in magazines, generally concentrating on the hardware. When asked if he was upset that the computer's debut was delayed by several months, Jobs responded, "Late? This computer is five years ahead of its time!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Macintosh Switcher's Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/macintoshswitche00stan|url-access=limited|last=Standefer|first=Robert|publisher=Wordware Publishing|year=2004|isbn=1-55622-045-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/macintoshswitche00stan/page/n49 33]|chapter=Evolution of Mac OS X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NeXT Computer is based on the new 25 MHz [[Motorola 68030]] [[central processing unit]] (CPU). The [[Motorola 88000]] [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] chip was originally considered, but was not available in sufficient quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Takahashi |first = Ken | title = Motorola making chips in Japan | work = Newsbytes | date = August 29, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes between 8 and 64 [[Megabyte|MB]] of [[random-access memory]] (RAM), a 256 MB [[magneto-optical drive|magneto-optical]] (MO) drive, a 40 MB ([[Paging|swap]]-only), 330 MB, or 660 MB [[hard disk drive]], 10BASE2 [[Ethernet]], [[NuBus]], and a 17-inch [[NeXT MegaPixel Display|MegaPixel]] grayscale display measuring 1120 by 832 [[pixel]]s. In 1989 a typical new PC, [[Macintosh]], or [[Amiga]] computer included a few megabytes of RAM, a 640×480 16-color or 320x240 4096-color display, a 10 to 20 megabyte hard drive, and few [[Computer network|networking]] capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

This supports sophisticated music and sound processing, including the [[Music Kit]] software.

The magneto-optical drive manufactured by [[Canon Inc.]] is the primary [[mass storage]] device. This drive technology was relatively new to the market, and the NeXT is the first computer to have used it.&lt;ref name="magneto-optical"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Developers split over optical drive (NeXT Inc's 256Mbyte erasable magneto-optical drive)|last=Rawles|first=Richard|date=September 19, 1989|work=[[MacWEEK]]|url-status=live|page=3.n33}}&lt;/ref&gt; MO drives were cheaper but much slower than hard drives; Jobs negotiated Canon's cost of $150 per blank MO disk down to a retail cost of only $50, and they have an average [[Hard disk drive performance characteristics#SEEKTIME|seek time]] of 96 ms. The design makes it impossible to move files between computers without a network, because each NeXT Computer has only one MO drive and the disk can not be removed without shutting down the system.&lt;ref name="magneto-optical" /&gt; Storage options proved challenging for the first NeXT Computers. The drive's limitations of speed and capacity make it insufficient as the primary medium running the NeXTSTEP operating system.&lt;ref name="magneto-optical" /&gt;

In 1989, NeXT struck a deal for former [[Compaq]] reseller Businessland to sell the NeXT Computer in select markets nationwide. Selling through a retailer was a major change from NeXT's original business model of only selling directly to students and educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/25/business/company-news-businessland-deal-seen-for-next-inc.html|title=COMPANY NEWS; Businessland Deal Seen for Next Inc.|date=1989-03-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-01-20|url-status=live|agency=Reuters|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701024345/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/25/business/company-news-businessland-deal-seen-for-next-inc.html|archive-date=July 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Businessland founder David Norman predicted that sales of the NeXT Computer would surpass sales of Compaq computers after 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Shaffer, Richard | title=NeXT means business now. | work=Personal Computing | date=July 1989 | publisher=[[InfoTrac|General Reference Center Gold]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Canon invested US$100 million in NeXT, giving it a 16.67 percent stake&lt;ref name="canon"&gt;{{Cite news | author=McCarthy, Vance | title=Steve Jobs just says no. | work=Fortune | date=July 17, 1993 | publisher=[[InfoTrac|General Reference Center Gold]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and making NeXT worth almost $600 million. Canon invested in NeXT with the condition of using the NeXTSTEP environment with its own workstations, which would mean a greatly expanded market for the software. After NeXT exited the hardware business, Canon produced a line of PCs called ''object.station'', including models 31, 41, 50, and 52, specifically designed to run NeXTSTEP for Intel.&lt;ref name="object"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kevra.org/TheBestOfNext/ThirdPartyProducts/ThirdPartyHardware/NeXTSTEPonNonNeXTComputers/IntelHardwareForNeXTStep/Canon-object-station41/Canon-object-station41/Canon-object-station41.html|title=Canon object.station 41|last=Ford|first=Kevin|website=The Best of NeXT Computers|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114182612/http://www.kevra.org/TheBestOfNext/ThirdPartyProducts/ThirdPartyHardware/NeXTSTEPonNonNeXTComputers/IntelHardwareForNeXTStep/Canon-object-station41/Canon-object-station41/Canon-object-station41.html|archive-date=January 14, 2012|access-date=September 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canon also served as NeXT's distributor in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last =Garfinkel | first =Simon L | title =Open Door Policy | publisher =NeXTWORLD | date =April 1994 | url =http://www.simson.net/ref/NeXT/nextworld/94.4/94.4.Apr.Japan1.html | access-date =May 11, 2008 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090208170326/http://www.simson.net/ref/NeXT/nextworld/94.4/94.4.Apr.Japan1.html | archive-date =February 8, 2009 | url-status =live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NeXT Computer was first released on the retail market in 1990, for {{US$|9999|1990}}. NeXT's original investor Ross Perot resigned from the board of directors in June 1991 to dedicate more time to [[Perot Systems]], a [[Plano, Texas]]-based systems integrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = NeXT may expand two-man board | work = PC Week | page = 125 | date = December 9, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second generation====
[[Image:NeXTstation.jpg|thumb|A [[NeXTstation]] with the original keyboard, mouse and the [[NeXT MegaPixel Display|NeXT MegaPixel]] monitor]]
NeXT released a second generation of workstations in 1990. The new range includes a revised NeXT Computer, renamed the [[NeXTcube]], and the [[NeXTstation]], nicknamed "the slab" for its form-factor of a low-rise box. Jobs explicitly ensured that NeXT staff did not use the nickname "[[Pizza box form factor|pizza box]]", so that the NeXT machines would not be compared to competing Sun workstations which already had that nickname. The magneto-optical drive was replaced with a 2.88 MB floppy drive but 2.88 MB floppy disks were expensive and the technology failed to supplant the 1.44 MB floppy. Realizing this, NeXT utilized the [[CD-ROM]] drive, which eventually became an industry standard for storage. Color graphics were available on the NeXTstation Color and on the [[NeXTdimension]] [[Video card|graphics processor]] hardware for the NeXTcube. The new computers were cheaper and faster than their predecessors, with the new [[Motorola 68040]] processor.

In 1992, NeXT launched "Turbo" variants of the NeXTcube and NeXTstation, with a 33 MHz 68040 processor and the maximum RAM capacity increased to 128 MB. NeXT sold 20,000 computers in 1992, and NeXT counted upgraded motherboards on back order as system sales. This is a small number compared with competitors, but the company reported sales of $140 million for the year which encouraged Canon to invest a further $30 million to keep the company afloat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff|url-access=registration|title=iCon: Steve Jobs|last=Young|first=Jeffrey S.|last2=Simon|first2=William L.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2005|isbn=0-471-72083-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff/page/200 200]|access-date=August 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191023023208/https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff|archive-date=October 23, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NeXT's long-term plan was to migrate to the emerging high-performance industry standard [[Reduced instruction set computer|Reduced Instruction Set Computing]] (RISC) architecture, with the NeXT RISC Workstation (NRW). Initially the NRW was to be based on the [[Motorola 88000#Implementations|Motorola 88110]] processor, but due to a lack of confidence in Motorola's commitment to the 88000-series architecture in the time leading up to the [[AIM alliance]]'s transition to [[PowerPC]], it was later redesigned around dual [[PowerPC 600#PowerPC 601|PowerPC 601s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simson.net/ref/NeXT/nextworld/NextWorld_Extra/93.03.Mar.NWE/93.03.Mar.NWExtra21.html|title=Hardware was great while it lasted|last=Garfinkel|first=Simson L.|date=March 1993|website=NeXTWORLD|accessdate=June 13, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614201019/http://www.simson.net/ref/NeXT/nextworld/NextWorld_Extra/93.03.Mar.NWE/93.03.Mar.NWExtra21.html|archive-date=June 14, 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simson.net/ref/NeXT/nextworld/NextWorld_Extra/93.03.Mar.NWE/93.03.Mar.NWExtra07.html|title=Canon to buy NeXT factory, design center|last=Lavin|first=Dan|date=March 1993|website=NeXTWORLD|url-status=live|accessdate=June 13, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614200658/http://www.simson.net/ref/NeXT/nextworld/NextWorld_Extra/93.03.Mar.NWE/93.03.Mar.NWExtra07.html|archive-date=June 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; NeXT produced some motherboards and enclosures, but exited the hardware business before full production.

NeXT systems were used by professors for scientific and engineering applications, and for developing finished newspaper layouts using News. [[George Mason University]] in the early 1990s had a set of NeXT workstations for publishing, as well as Silicon Graphics for CAD/GL and Mathematica for astrophysics. The games ''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'', ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'', and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' were [[Development of Doom#Programming|developed]] by [[id Software]] on NeXT machines. Other games based on the [[Doom engine|''Doom'' engine]], such as ''[[Heretic (video game)|Heretic]]'' and ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic]]'' by [[Raven Software]], as well as ''[[Strife (1996 video game)|Strife]]'' by [[Rogue Entertainment]], were also developed on NeXT hardware using id's tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rome.ro/2006/12/apple-next-merger-birthday.html|title=Apple-NeXT Merger Birthday!|last=Romero|first=John|date=December 20, 2006|website=Planet Rome.ro|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305165006/http://rome.ro/2006/12/apple-next-merger-birthday.html|archive-date=March 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other commercial programs were released for NeXT computers, including Altsys Virtuoso, a vector drawing program with page-layout features which was ported to Mac OS and Microsoft Windows as Aldus FreeHand v4, and the [[Lotus Improv]] [[spreadsheet]] program. The systems were bundled with a number of smaller built-in applications, such as the [[Merriam-Webster]] Collegiate Dictionary, [[Oxford University Press|Oxford]] Quotations, the complete works of [[William Shakespeare]], and the Digital Librarian search engine to access them.

===1993–96: NeXT Software, Inc.===
[[File:NeXTSTEP desktop.png|thumb|[[NeXTSTEP]], the [[operating system]] used by the NeXTcube and NeXTstation]]
NeXT started [[porting]] the NeXTSTEP operating system to [[IBM PC compatible]] computers using the [[Intel 80486]] processor in late 1991 because of a change in business strategy to withdraw from the hardware business entirely. A demonstration of the port was displayed at the NeXTWorld Expo in January 1992. By mid-1993 the product was complete and version 3.1, also known as NeXTSTEP 486, was released. Prior to this release, [[Chrysler]] planned to buy 3,000 copies in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Next Computer Close To a Deal With Chrysler | date=September 8, 1992 | work=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NeXTSTEP 3.x was later ported to [[PA-RISC]]&lt;ref name="RISC"&gt;{{Cite news | last =Sherman | first =Lee | title =First NeXT RISC Workstation | work =NeXTWORLD | year =2004 | url =http://www.simson.net/ref/NeXT/nextworld/94.4/94.4.Apr.PA-RISC1.html | accessdate =April 14, 2008 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080613180500/http://www.simson.net/ref/NeXT/nextworld/94.4/94.4.Apr.PA-RISC1.html | archive-date =June 13, 2008 | url-status =live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SPARC]]-based platforms, for a total of four versions: NeXTSTEP/NeXT (for NeXT's own hardware), NeXTSTEP/Intel, NeXTSTEP/PA-RISC, and NeXTSTEP/SPARC.

NeXT withdrew from the [[Orphaned technology|hardware]] business in 1993 and the company was renamed NeXT Software, Inc.; consequently, 300 of the 540 staff employees were laid off.&lt;ref name="employees"/&gt; NeXT negotiated to sell the hardware business, including the Fremont factory, to Canon&lt;ref name="employees"/&gt; which later pulled out of the deal. Work on the PowerPC machines was stopped, along with all hardware production. CEO of [[Sun Microsystems]] [[Scott McNealy]] announced plans to invest $10 million in 1993 and use NeXT software in future Sun systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Sun invests in Next, which will license NextStep OS for Sparc. | work=InfoWorld | date=November 29, 1993 | publisher=[[InfoTrac|General Reference Center Gold]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; NeXT partnered with Sun to create [[OpenStep]] which is NeXTSTEP's application layer hosted on a third party operating system.

After exiting the hardware business, NeXT focused on other operating systems, in effect returning to the original business plan. New products based on OpenStep were released, including OpenStep Enterprise, a version for Microsoft's [[Windows NT]]. The company launched [[WebObjects]], a platform for building large-scale dynamic web applications. Many large businesses including [[Dell]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[MCI Inc.|WorldCom]], and the [[BBC]] used WebObjects for a short time.&lt;ref name="webobjects"&gt;{{Cite web | date=June 16, 2005 | first=Johnny | last=Evans | title=Apple releases WebObjects as a free application | work=[[MacCentral]] | url=http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?NewsID=11860 | accessdate=April 14, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612210214/http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?NewsID=11860 | archive-date=June 12, 2008 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually [[WebObjects]] was used solely to power Apple's [[iTunes Store]] and most of its corporate website,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | date=June 2, 2003 | last=Dalrymple | first=Jim | title=Xserves power iTunes Music Store, 'America 24/7' | url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1024637/xserve.html | work=[[Macworld]] | accessdate=October 18, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019003410/https://www.macworld.com/article/1024637/xserve.html | archive-date=October 19, 2017 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; until discontinuing the software.

Several NeXT executives replaced their Apple counterparts when Steve Jobs restructured the company's board of directors.

NeXTSTEP's processor-independent capabilities were retained in Mac OS X, leading to both PowerPC and Intel x86 versions (although only PowerPC versions were publicly available before 2006). Apple moved to Intel processors by August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release | title=Apple to Use Intel Microprocessors Beginning in 2006 | url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html | publisher=Apple Computer | date=June 6, 2005 | accessdate=June 13, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722102013/https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html | archive-date=July 22, 2010 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate culture and community==
Jobs created a different corporate culture at NeXT in terms of facilities, salaries, and benefits. Jobs had experimented with some structural changes at Apple but at NeXT he abandoned conventional corporate structures, instead making a "community" with "members" instead of employees. There were only two different salaries at NeXT until the early 1990s. Team members who joined before 1986 were paid {{US$|75000|1986}} and those who joined afterward were paid {{US$|50000|1986}}. This caused a few awkward situations where managers were paid less than their employees. Employees were given performance reviews and raises every six months because of the spartan salary plans. To foster openness, all employees had full access to the payrolls, although few employees ever took advantage of the privilege. NeXT's [[health insurance]] plan offered benefits to not only married couples but unmarried couples and same-sex couples, although the latter privilege was later withdrawn due to insurance complications.&lt;ref name="The NeXT Big Thing"/&gt;{{rp|80}} The payroll schedule was also very different from other companies in Silicon Valley at the time because instead of being delivered twice a month in arrears at the end of the pay period, it was delivered once a month in advance.&lt;ref name="The NeXT Big Thing"/&gt;{{rp|289}}

Jobs found office space in [[Palo Alto, California]] on 3475 Deer Creek Road, occupying a glass and concrete building which featured a staircase designed by architect [[I. M. Pei]]. The first floor used hardwood flooring and large worktables where the workstations would be assembled. To avoid inventory errors, NeXT used the [[Just-in-time manufacturing|just-in-time]] (JIT) inventory strategy. The company contracted out for all major [[wikt:component|components]] such as mainboards and cases and had the finished components shipped to the first floor for assembly. The second floor was the office space with an open floor plan. The only enclosed rooms were Jobs's office and a few conference rooms.&lt;ref name="AppleConfidential"&gt;{{Cite book | first=Owen W. | last=Linzmayer | title=Apple Confidential 2.0 | publisher=No Starch Press | year=2004 |isbn=1-59327-010-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|323}}

As NeXT expanded, more office space was needed. The company rented an office at 800 and 900 Chesapeake Drive in Redwood City, also designed by Pei. The architectural centerpiece was a "floating" staircase with no visible supports. The open floor plan was retained, although furnishings became luxurious, with $5,000 chairs, $10,000 sofas, and [[Ansel Adams]] prints.&lt;ref name="The NeXT Big Thing"/&gt;{{rp|80}}

NeXT's first campus in Palo Alto was subsequently occupied by [[SAP SE|SAP AG]]. Its second campus in Redwood City was occupied by ApniCure and [[OncoMed|OncoMed Pharmaceuticals Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=The NeXT big thing: OncoMed finds a home | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2007/10/29/focus6.html?page=all | publisher=American City Business Journals | date=October 28, 2007 | accessdate=June 11, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111014158/http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2007/10/29/focus6.html?page=all | archive-date=November 11, 2013 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first issue of ''NeXTWORLD'' magazine was printed in 1991. It was published in [[San Francisco]] by Integrated Media and edited by Michael Miley and later Dan Ruby. It was the only mainstream periodical to discuss NeXT computers, the operating system, and NeXT software. The publication was discontinued in 1994 after only four volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Serial Archive Listings for NeXTWORLD | website=The Online Books Page | url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/serial?id=nextworld | accessdate=June 13, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612124153/http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/serial?id=nextworld | archive-date=June 12, 2008 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''NeXTWORLD Expo'' followed as a developer [[Convention (meeting)|conference]], held in 1991 and 1992 at the San Francisco Civic Center and in 1993 and 1994 at the [[Moscone Center]] in San Francisco, with Steve Jobs as the keynote speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=NeXT makes play for corporate market | work=PC Week | author=NextStep users seek safety in big numbers | date=January 27, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Though not very profitable, the company had a wide-ranging impact on the computer industry. [[Object-oriented programming]] and [[graphical user interface]]s became more common after the 1988 release of the NeXTcube and NeXTSTEP. The technologically successful platform was often held as the trendsetter when other companies started to emulate the success of NeXT's object-oriented system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Smith, Carrie | title=NeXT means business now. | work=Wall Street &amp; Technology | date=May 1994 | publisher=[[InfoTrac|General Reference Center Gold]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widely seen as a response to NeXT, Microsoft announced the [[Cairo (operating system)|Cairo project]] in 1991; the Cairo specification included similar object-oriented user interface features for a coming consumer version of Windows NT. Although Cairo was ultimately abandoned, some elements were integrated into other projects. By 1994, Microsoft and NeXT were collaborating on a Windows NT port of OpenStep which was never released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Smith, Carrie | title=NeXT, Microsoft tackle objects: NT to gain OpenStep port. | work=PC Week | date=November 7, 1994 | publisher=[[InfoTrac|General Reference Center Gold]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1993, [[Taligent]] was considered by the press to be a competitor in objects and operating systems even without any product release, with NeXT being a main point of comparison. For the first few years, Taligent's theoretical newness was often compared to NeXT's older but mature and commercially established platform,&lt;ref name="Unixworld April 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NeXTWORLD Feb 1994"&gt;{{Cite interview | magazine=NeXTWORLD | date=February 1994 | page=23-24 | first=Bud | last=Tribble | interviewer=NeXTWORLD | title=Bud Tribble Explains It All | url=https://archive.org/details/nextworld-1994/ | accessdate=February 10, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200103205939/https://archive.org/details/nextworld-1994/ | archive-date=January 3, 2020 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

[[WebObjects]] failed to achieve wide popularity partly because of the initial high price of US$50,000,&lt;ref name=birthdaywo&gt;{{Cite web |work=MacObserver |url=http://www.macobserver.com/article/2006/03/28.14.shtml |title=Happy Birthday: WebObjects at 10 |accessdate=June 13, 2008 |last=Stewart |first=Graham |year=2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620231311/http://www.macobserver.com/article/2006/03/28.14.shtml |archive-date=June 20, 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it remains the first and most prominent early example of a web application server that enabled dynamic page generation based on user interactions as opposed to static content. WebObjects is now bundled with [[macOS Server]] and [[Xcode]].&lt;ref name=birthdaywo/&gt;
