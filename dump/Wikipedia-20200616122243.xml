'''Third Rome''' is the hypothetical successor of the [[Roman Empire]] via the [[Byzantine Empire]] or the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rbth.com/arts/history/2017/03/30/why-do-russians-call-moscow-the-third-rome_730921 | title=Why do Russians call Moscow the Third Rome?| date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 800, the title of [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor of the Romans]] was granted to [[Charlemagne]] by [[Pope Leo III]]. The word "holy" (often retroactively applied to all emperors since Charlemagne) was added under the reign of emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I Barbarossa]] in 1157.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Moraw, ''Heiliges Reich'', in: [[Lexikon des Mittelalters]], Munich &amp; Zurich: Artemis 1977–1999,  vol. 4,  columns 2025–2028.&lt;/ref&gt;

===German claims===
Later the [[German Empire]] in 1871 also claimed to be the Third Rome, also through lineage of the HRE.&lt;ref name="Warwick Ball 2000. p. 449"&gt;Warwick Ball. ''Rome in the East: The Transformation of an Empire''. London, England, UK: Routledge, 2000. p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Craig M. White 2007. P. 169"&gt;Craig M. White. ''The Great German Nation: Origins and Destiny''. AuthorHouse, 2007. p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The title for emperors of the Holy Roman Empire, the Austrian Empire and the German Empire was ''[[Kaiser]]'' (derived from Latin Caesar), the German word for emperor.

[[Nazi Germany]] used the term ''Drittes Reich'' (meaning "Third Realm" or "Third Empire"), as successor of the first realm (HRE) and the second realm (the German Empire). In 1939, however, in a circular not intended for publication, further use of the term "Third Reich" was prohibited.&lt;ref name="Bollmus236"&gt;Reinhard Bollmus: ''Das Amt Rosenberg und seine Gegner. Studien zum Machtkampf im nationalsozialistischen Herrschaftssystem.'' Stuttgart 1970, S. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austrian claims===
[[File:Österreich-Wappen (1934-1938).svg|thumb|left|Eagle of the Federal State of Austria]]
After the Holy Roman Empire was dismantled in 1806, the [[Austrian Empire]] sought to lay claim as the heir of the Holy Roman Empire as Austria's [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] attempted to unite Germany under their rule.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

The [[Federal State of Austria]] used some symbols from the Holy Roman Empire and the Austrian Empire:&lt;br /&gt;The [[Cross potent]], symbol of the [[Fatherland Front (Austria)|Fatherland Front]], was as medieval symbol – the oldest representation is on the (German) [[Imperial Sword]] (one of the four most important parts of the [[Imperial Regalia]] of the HRE). The consistent use of this propaganda symbol was new to Austria.&lt;br /&gt;In contrast to the one-headed, graphically strictly designed eagle of the German Reich, the eagle of the estates state leaned against the two-headed ''Quaternionenadler'' of the Holy Roman Empire. Since Old Austria had led the double eagle for centuries, since the [[Habsburg]]s became [[Holy Roman Emperor]], the return to it seemed nostalgic. The traditional care with elements of imperial Austria, the admission of aristocratic titles and the partial reversal of the [[Habsburg Law]] fit in with this.&lt;br /&gt;The [[Austrian Armed Forces]] received in 1934 (with the exception of the small air forces) instead of the previously worn comparatively modern uniforms in the style of the [[Reichswehr]] such in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|manner of the Danube monarchy]].

Additionally, Austria may lay claim over the Byzantine Empire, as it can be argued that Spain lost their claim to Austria after the war of the Spanish Succession.{{cn|date=March 2020}}

===French claims===
{{Main|First French Empire}}
[[File:Napoleonic Eagle.svg|thumb|150px|right|Eagle of Napoleon Bonaparte of France]]
In four campaigns, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] transformed his "[[Charlemagne|Carolingian]]" [[feudal]] and [[Federation|federal]] empire into one modelled on the [[Roman Empire]]. The memories of imperial Rome were for a third time, after [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Charlemagne]], used to modify the historical evolution of France. Though the vague plan for an invasion of Great Britain was never executed, the [[Battle of Ulm]] and the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] overshadowed the defeat of [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], and the camp at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] put at Napoleon's disposal the best military resources he had commanded, in the form of ''[[La Grande Armée]]''.

When Napoleon proclaimed himself Emperor of France, he also called [[Crown of Napoleon|his own imperial crown]] the "Crown of Charlemagne".

Desperate for money, [[Andreas Palaiologos]] sold the rights to the Byzantine crown which he possessed since the death of his father. [[Charles VIII of France]] purchased the rights of succession from Andreas during 1494 and died on April 7, 1498.&lt;ref name="Norwich, John Julius p.446"&gt;Norwich, John Julius, ''Byzantium – The Decline and Fall'', p.446&lt;/ref&gt; The following Kings of France continued the claim and used the Imperial titles and honors: [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] and [[Francis II of France|Francis II]].  Not until [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] in 1566 did the imperial claim come to an eventual end through the rules of [[extinctive prescription]] as a direct result of desuetude or lack of use. Charles IX wrote that the imperial Byzantine title "is not more eminent than that of king, which sounds better and sweeter."&lt;ref&gt;David Potter, ''A History of France, 1460–1560: The Emergence of a Nation State'', 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==

[[File:Fascist Eagle.svg|right|thumb|150px|upright|An ''[[Aquila (Roman)|aquila]]'' clutching a [[fasces]] was a common symbol used in Fascist Italy.]]
In Italy, the concept of a "Third Rome" is related to the capital of the [[Kingdom of Italy]], created in 1861, and the current [[Italian Republic]], created in 1946.

===Risorgimento===
[[Giuseppe Mazzini]], Italian nationalist and patriot, promoted the notion of the "Third Rome" during the [[Risorgimento]]. He said, "After the Rome of the [[Roman Emperor|emperors]], after the Rome of the [[Pope]]s, there will come the Rome of the [[Italians|people]]", addressing [[Italian unification]] and the establishment of Rome as the capital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://students.washington.edu/ageparke/rome.htm Rome Seminar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204065057/http://students.washington.edu/ageparke/rome.htm |date=4 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the unification of Italy into the [[Kingdom of Italy]], the state was referred to as the Third Rome by Italian figures.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Duggan. ''The Force of Destiny: A History of Italy Since 1796''. New York, New York, USA: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2008. p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the unification, Mazzini spoke of the need of Italy as a Third Rome to have [[Italian Empire|imperial aspirations]].&lt;ref name="Silvana Patriarca p. 248"&gt;Silvana Patriarca, Lucy Riall. The Risorgimento Revisited: Nationalism and Culture in Nineteenth-Century Italy. p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Mazzini said that Italy should "invade and colonize [[Tunisia]]n lands" as it was the "key to the Central Mediterranean", and he viewed Italy as having the right to dominate the [[Mediterranean Sea]] as ancient Rome had done.&lt;ref name="Silvana Patriarca p. 248"/&gt;

===Fascist Empire===
{{see also|Italian Empire|Italian Fascism}}
In his speeches, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] referred to his [[Imperial Italy (fascist)|Fascist Italy]] as a "Third Rome" or as a [[New Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Clark, ''Mussolini: Profiles in Power'' (London: Pearson Longman, 2005), 136.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Terza Roma'' (Third Rome; the Fascist Rome after the Imperial and the Papal ones) was also a name for Mussolini's plan to expand Rome towards [[Ostia (town)|Ostia]] and the sea. The [[EUR, Rome|EUR]] neighbourhood was the first step in that direction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040624114143/http://www.fascismoeliberta.net/kf/Discorso31dicembre1925.htm Discorso pronunciato in Campidoglio per l'insediamento del primo Governatore di Roma il 31 dicembre 1925], [[Internet Archive]] copy of a page with a Mussolini speech.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 913, [[Simeon I of Bulgaria]] was crowned Emperor ([[Tsar]]) by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] and imperial regent [[Nicholas Mystikos]] outside of the Byzantine capital. In its final simplified form, the title read "Emperor and Autocrat of all Bulgarians and Romans" (''Car i samodǎržec na vsički bǎlgari i gǎrci'' in the modern vernacular). The Roman component in the Bulgarian imperial title indicated both rulership over Greek speakers and the derivation of the imperial tradition from the Romans, however this component was never recognised by the Byzantine court.

Byzantine recognition of Simeon's imperial title was revoked by the succeeding Byzantine government. The decade 914–927 was spent in a destructive [[Byzantine–Bulgarian war of 913–927|Byzantine–Bulgarian war]] over this and other matters of conflict. The Bulgarian monarch, who had further irritated his Byzantine counterpart by claiming the title "Emperor of the Romans" (''basileus tōn Rōmaiōn''), was eventually recognized, as "Emperor of the Bulgarians" (''basileus tōn Boulgarōn'') by the Byzantine Emperor [[Romanus I|Romanos I Lakapenos]] in 924. Byzantine recognition of the imperial dignity of the Bulgarian monarch and the patriarchal dignity of the [[Patriarch of All Bulgaria|Bulgarian patriarch]] was again confirmed at the conclusion of permanent peace and a Bulgarian–Byzantine dynastic marriage in 927. In the meantime, the Bulgarian imperial title may have been also confirmed by the [[Pope]]. The Bulgarian imperial title "tsar" was adopted by all Bulgarian monarchs up to the fall of Bulgaria under Ottoman rule. 

The 14th-century Bulgarian literary compositions clearly denoted the then Bulgarian capital ([[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]]) as a successor of Rome and [[Constantinople]], in effect, the "Third Rome".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duychev|1972|p=430}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgarian contemporaries called the city "Tsarevgrad Tarnov", the ''Imperial city of Tarnovo'', after the Bulgarian name for Constantinople—[[Tsarigrad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|pp=620–621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russian claims ===
{{Main|Moscow, third Rome}}
{{See also|The Tale of the Princes of Vladimir}}
[[File:Lesser Coat of Arms of Russian Empire.svg|thumb|left|[[Coat of arms]] of the [[Russian Empire]] with the [[double-headed eagle]], formerly associated with the Byzantine Empire|224x224px]]
Known as a theological and a political concept "Moscow is the Third Rome", it was formulated in the 15th–16th centuries in the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]].&lt;ref name=use/&gt; In the concept there could be traced three interrelated and interpenetrating fields of ideas: a) theology that is linked with justification of necessity and inevitability in unity of [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]; b) social politics that are derived out of the feeling of unity in [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] territories being historically tied through Christian Orthodox faith and Slavic culture; c) state doctrine, according to which the Moscow Prince should act as a supreme sovereign (Sovereign and legislator) of Christian Orthodox nations and become a defender of the Christian Orthodox Church. Herewith the Church should facilitate the Sovereign in execution of his function supposedly determined by God, the autocratic administration.&lt;ref name=use/&gt;

Within decades after the [[fall of Constantinople|capture of Constantinople]] by [[Mehmed II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] on 29 May 1453, some Eastern Orthodox people were nominating [[Moscow]] as the "Third Rome", or the "New Rome".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor1-last = Parry| editor1-first = Ken| editor2-first = David |editor2-last=Melling | title = The Blackwell Dictionary of Eastern Christianity| publisher = Blackwell Publishing| year = 1999| location = Malden, MA | isbn =978-0-631-23203-2| page = 490  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stirrings of this sentiment began during the reign of [[Ivan III of Russia]], who styled himself Czar (cf. Caesar), who had married [[Sophia Paleologue]]. Sophia was a niece of [[Constantine XI]], the last [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]].  By the rules and laws of [[Hereditary monarchy|inheritance]] followed by most European [[Monarchy|monarchies]] of the time, Ivan could claim that he and his offspring were heirs of the fallen [[Byzantine Empire|Empire]], but the Roman traditions of the empire had never recognized automatic inheritance of the Imperial office.&lt;ref&gt;Nicol, Donald MacGillivray, Last Centuries of Byzantium, 1261–1453, Cambridge University Press, Second Edition, 1993, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of Muscovy as heir to Rome crystallized with a [[panegyric]] letter composed by the [[Russia]]n monk [[Philotheus of Pskov|Philotheus (Filofey) of Pskov]] in 1510 to their son Grand Duke [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili III]],&lt;ref name="use"&gt;Mashkov, A.D. ''[http://leksika.com.ua/10651009/legal/moskva_-_tretiy_rim Moscow is the Third Rome (МОСКВА – ТРЕТІЙ РИМ)]. [[Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia]].''&lt;/ref&gt; which proclaimed, "Two Romes have fallen. The third stands. And there will be no fourth. No one shall replace your Christian [[Tsar]]dom!" Contrary to the common misconception, Filofey&lt;ref&gt;[http://orthodoxwiki.org/Philotheus_of_Pskov Filofey]&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly identifies Third Rome with [[Muscovy]] (the country) rather than with [[Moscow]] (the city), although the term "Muscovy" was considered synonymous with the Russian lands at the time. Somewhat notably, [[Seven hills of Moscow|Moscow is placed on seven hills]], as were [[Seven hills of Rome|Rome]] and [[Seven hills of Constantinople|Constantinople]].

=== Anatolian Seljuk claims ===
[[File:Seljuqs Eagle.svg|thumb|150px|The double-headed Seljuq Eagle]]
The [[Sultanate of Rum|Sultanate of Rûm]] (1077–1308) was established in the parts of [[Anatolia]] which had been conquered from the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] by the Seljuk Empire. The name ''[[Rûm]]'' is the Persian name of Rome and the Roman Empire, from the Arabic {{lang|ar|الرُّومُ}} ''ar-Rūm'', a loan from the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Ρωμιοί}} "[[Names of the Greeks#Rhomaioi|Romans]]".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Kazhdan, "Rūm" ''The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium'' (Oxford University Press, 1991), vol. 3, p. 1816.
[[Paul Wittek]], ''Rise of the Ottoman Empire'', Royal Asiatic Society Books, Routledge (2013), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=FQwukvsKY-AC&amp;pg=PA81 p. 81]:
"This state too bore the name of Rûm, if not officially, then at least in everyday usage, and its princes appear in the Eastern chronicles under the name 'Seljuks of Rûm' (Ar.: ''Salâjika ar-Rûm'').
A. Christian Van Gorder, ''Christianity in Persia and the Status of Non-muslims in Iran'' p. 215: "The Seljuqs called the lands of their sultanate ''Rum'' because it had been established on territory long considered 'Roman', i.e. Byzantine, by Muslim armies."&lt;/ref&gt; 

The double-headed Seljuk Eagle relief was used in [[caravanserai]]s, madrasas and other official architectural works. A royal association of the motif is suggested by its appearance on the keystone of an arch of the citadel built at [[Konya]] (Ikoniom) under [[Kayqubad I]] (r. 1220–1237).&lt;ref&gt;"It was from the East Roman Empire, however, that the Turks adopted the double-headed eagle.  A royal association with this emblem is suggested by its appearance on the keystone of an arch from the Seljuk citadel at Ikonion.  This is made even more explicit by the double-headed eagle emblazoned with the word ''al-Sultan'' on a ceramic tile excavated at the palace of Alaeddin Kaykubad at Kubadabad, near Akşehir" Helen C.  Evans, William D.  Wixom, ''The Glory of East Roman Empire: Art and Culture of the Middle East Roman Era, A.D. 843&amp;ndash;1261'', Metropolitan Museum of Art (1997), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Caqa12aj55wC&amp;pg=PA411#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 411].&lt;/ref&gt; The motif also appears on [[Turkmens|Turkomen]] coins of this era, notably on coins minted under Artuqid ruler [[Nasir al-Din Mahmud (Artuqid)|Nasir al-Din Mahmud]] of [[Hasankeyf]] (r. 1200–1222).&lt;ref&gt;"Artuqids of Mardin, Nasir al-Din Mahmud (1200 - 1222 AD), AE Dirhem 26 mm; minted AH 617 (1220/1221 AD) obv: Two-headed eagle.

=== Ottoman claims ===
[[File:Gennadios II and Mehmed II.jpg|thumb|left|Sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror with patriarch [[Gennadius II]] depicted on an 18th-century mosaic]]
After the fall of Constantinople in 1453 AD, [[Mehmed II]] declared himself ''Kayser-i Rum'', literally "[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] of [[Roman Empire|Rome]]".&lt;ref&gt;İlber Ortaylı, "Büyük Constantin ve İstanbul", Milliyet, 28 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The claim was recognized by the Orthodox [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], but not by the Roman Catholic Western Europe. [[Gennadius II|Gennadios]] (Georgios Scholarios), a staunch enemy of the West, had been enthroned Patriarch of Constantinople with all the ceremonial attributes of Byzantium by Mehmed himself acting as Roman Emperor and in turn Gennadios recognized Mehmed as successor to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dimitri Kitsikis]], Türk-Yunan İmparatorluğu. Arabölge gerçeği ışığında Osmanlı Tarihine bakış – İstanbul, İletişim Yayınları, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Mehmed's claim rested with the concept that Constantinople was the seat of the Roman Empire, after the transfer of its capital to Constantinople in 330 AD and the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. Mehmed also had a blood lineage to the Byzantine Imperial family; his predecessor, Sultan [[Orhan I]] had married a Byzantine princess, and Mehmed may have claimed descent from [[John Tzelepes Komnenos]].&lt;ref name="Norwich 1995 413–416"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Norwich | first = John Julius | authorlink = John Julius Norwich  | year = 1995 | title = Byzantium:The Decline and Fall | pages = 81–82 | publisher = Alfred A.

The term appeared for the first time during the debates of [[Prime Ministers of Greece|Prime Minister]] [[Ioannis Kolettis]] with [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]] that preceded the promulgation of the 1844 constitution.&lt;ref name="BA0"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-26420 ''History of Greece''] Encyclopædia Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt; This was a visionary nationalist aspiration that was to dominate foreign relations and, to a significant extent, determine domestic politics of the Greek state for much of the first century of independence. The expression was new in 1844 but the concept had roots in the Greek popular psyche. It long had hopes of liberation from Turkish rule and restoration of the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref name="BA0" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Πάλι με χρόνια με καιρούς,
:πάλι δικά μας θα 'ναι!

(''Once more, as years and time go by, once more they shall be ours'').&lt;ref name="BK0"&gt;D. Bolukbasi and D. Bölükbaşı, ''Turkey And Greece: The Aegean Disputes'', Routledge Cavendish 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Megali Idea'' implied the goal of reviving the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, by establishing a [[Greece|Greek state]], which would be, as ancient geographer [[Strabo]] wrote, a Greek world encompassing mostly the former Byzantine lands from the [[Ionian Sea]] to the west, to [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Black Sea]] to the east and from [[Thrace]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Epirus]] to the north, to [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]] to the south. This new state would have [[Constantinople]] as its capital: it would be the "Greece of Two Continents and Five Seas" (Europe and Asia, the Ionian, Aegean, Marmara, Black and Libyan seas, respectively).

In 1345, the Serbian King [[Stefan Dusan|Stefan Uroš IV Dušan]] proclaimed himself Emperor ([[Tsar]]) and was crowned as such at [[Skopje]] on [[Easter]] 1346 by the newly created [[Serbian Patriarch]], and by the [[Patriarch of All Bulgaria]] and the autocephalous [[Archbishop of Ohrid]]. His imperial title was recognized by the Bulgarian Empire and various other neighbors and trading partners but not by the Byzantine Empire. In its final simplified form, the Serbian imperial title read "Emperor of Serbs and Romans" (''цар Срба и Римљана'' in modern Serbian). It was only employed by Stefan Uroš IV Dušan and his son Stefan Uroš V in Serbia (until his death in 1371), after which it became extinct. A half-brother of Dušan, [[Simeon Uroš]], and then his son [[Jovan Uroš]], claimed the same title, until the latter's abdication in 1373, while ruling as dynasts in [[Thessaly]]. The "Roman" component in the Serbian imperial title indicates both rulership over Greeks and the derivation of the imperial tradition from the Romans.

=== Latin claims ===

The [[Latin Empire]] (official Empire of Romania) was a Crusader state founded after the [[Fourth Crusade]] on lands captured and [[Usurper|usurped]] the imperial throne from the Byzantine Empire. The Latin Empire was intended to supplant the Byzantine Empire as the titular Roman Empire in the east, with a Western [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] emperor enthroned in place of the Eastern [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Roman emperors. [[James of Baux]] willed his titular claims to Duke [[Louis I, Duke of Anjou|Louis I of Anjou]], also claimant to the throne of Naples, but Louis and his descendants (including the  Holy Roman Emperor from the [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] and the Austrian emperors through [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]]) never used the title.

=== Spanish claims ===

The claimant Eastern Roman Emperor [[Andreas Palaiologos]] ceded the Roman Imperial crown to [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] in his last will dated April 7, 1502.&lt;ref&gt;Polychrones Kyprianos Enepekides, ''Das Wiener Testament des Andreas Palaiologos vom 7. April 1502''&lt;/ref&gt; 
Many cities and institutions in the Kingdom of Spain to this day use the double-headed Roman eagle. The city of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[province of Toledo]] and the [[province of Zamora]] are just few of many examples.

==In popular culture==
The concept of a "Third Rome" figures greatly in the second memoir of [[Whittaker Chambers]].  Although published posthumously as ''Cold Friday'' (1964), Chambers had planned it from inception as "The Third Rome". A long chapter called "The Third Rome" appears in the memoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chambers| first = Whittaker | title = Cold Friday| publisher = Random House| date = 1964| place = New York| lccn = 64020025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = O'Brien| first = Conor Cruise | title = The Perjured Saint| work = [[The New York Review of Books]] | date = 19 November 1964 | url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1964/nov/19/the-perjured-saint/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Chambers| first = David| title = Whittaker Chambers (1901–1961): Ghosts and Phantoms| publisher = WhittakerChambers.org| date = 9 July 2011| url = http://whittakerchambers.org/2011/07/09/whittaker-chambers-1961-ghosts-and-phantoms/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1997 film, ''[[The Saint (1997 film)|The Saint]]'', the villain, Russian oil magnate Ivan Tretiak, publishes a book titled ''The Third Rome''.

''Third Rome'' is also a DLC for the historical grand strategy game ''[[Europa Universalis IV]]''. It adds features for [[Russian people|Russian]] nations and the Orthodox religion.
