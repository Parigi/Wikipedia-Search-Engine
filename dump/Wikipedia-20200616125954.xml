As of 2019, twelve '''[[Nobel Prize]]''' laureates have been [[Muslim]]s, more than half in the 21st century. Seven of the twelve laureates have been awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], while three have been for the sciences. The recipient of the 1979 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], [[Abdus Salam]], was a member of the [[Ahmadiyya]] community of [[Pakistan]]. [[Aziz Sancar]] is the second Turkish Nobel laureate and was awarded the [[Nobel prize in Chemistry]] in the field of [[molecular biology]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2015/&lt;/ref&gt;
