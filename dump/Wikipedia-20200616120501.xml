'''''FutureSex/LoveSounds''''' is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter [[Justin Timberlake]]. Released on September 8, 2006, by [[Jive Records]] and its affiliated label of the [[Zomba Group of Companies]]. During a two-year hiatus, Timberlake resolved his feelings on being unable to record any new material, and as he returned to record some new music, he began collaborating with his longtime [[record producer]] [[Timbaland]], alongside the latter's colleague [[Danja (record producer)|Danja]]. The album's contents were produced at Timbaland's [[Thomas Crown Studios]]. The album shares some lyrical themes with Timberlake's debut album ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]'' (2002), although ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' was influenced by a wider range of genres, including [[trance music|trance]], [[funk]] and [[rock music|rock]].&lt;ref name="rstone"/&gt; The [[reprise]]s and [[bridge (music)|interlude]]s interspersed on the album's tracks were created by the production team with the goal of channeling Timberlake's influences.

''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' received mostly positive reviews from critics, who noted its wide range of influences and collection of eclectic sounds. The album produced six singles that attained chart success; including US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one singles: "[[SexyBack]]", "[[My Love (Justin Timberlake song)|My Love]]", and "[[What Goes Around... Comes Around]]". With "[[Summer Love (Justin Timberlake song)|Summer Love]]", the album achieved four US [[Mainstream Top 40]] number-one songs. Many music publications considered it among the best albums of the 2000s. Aside from earning numerous best-of-the-decade lists, the album received several [[49th Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nominations, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]], while its first four singles won in their respective categories. It has been [[Music recording sales certification|certified multi-platinum]] in many countries worldwide, and has sold over 10 million copies, with four million in the United States. The album has been added to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]'s musical library and archive. It is also considered by critics and fans to be one of Timberlake's best albums to date. To further promote the album, Timberlake embarked on his second concert tour, entitled [[FutureSex/LoveShow]], which became one of the highest-grossing tours in 2007.

In November 2002, Justin Timberlake released his debut album, ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/justified/id252606580|title=Justified by Justin Timberlake|publisher=[[iTunes Store]] (US). [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and produced the U.S. top-five singles "[[Rock Your Body]]" and "[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=justin timberlake|chart=all}}|title=Justin Timberlake Album &amp; Song Chart History|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Cry Me a River" in particular was credited for having helped the album sell and peak on the music charts.&lt;ref name="rolling stone cover story"/&gt; ''Justified'' ended selling four million copies in the United States alone.&lt;ref name="rolling stone cover story"/&gt; Although the album established Timberlake's career outside his then-band [['NSYNC|*NSYNC]],&lt;ref name="burnt out"/&gt; Timberlake (who was 22 years old at the time), was "at a crossroads" and felt he was at the stage of being "burnt out",&lt;ref name="rolling stone cover story"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mtvnews1"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |title=Road To The Grammys: Justin Wanted To Channel Coldplay On FutureSex/LoveSounds |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1552019/20070208/timberlake_justin.jhtml |date=February 9, 2007 |publisher=MTV News. Viacom |accessdate=January 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thought he had lost his voice "in regards to knowing what (and how) he wanted to sing".&lt;ref name="mtvnews1"/&gt; Timberlake stated that ''Justified'' had been years in the making, and a record that would re-create its success would be a challenge he was not ready to take.&lt;ref name="Moss2"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Moss |first=Corey |title=Don't Expect Justified 2: Timberlake Enlists Rick Rubin For New LP |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1519771/20060105/timberlake_justin.jhtml |publisher=MTV News. Viacom |date=January 5, 2006 |accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, Timberlake went partially idle in the music industry.&lt;ref name="rolling stone cover story"&gt;{{Cite news|ref=harv |last=Scaggs |first=Austin |title=Justin Timberlake Revs Up His Sex Machine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11514699/cover_story_justin_timberlake_revs_up_his_sex_machine |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=[[Jann S.

In October 2003, he hosted and was the guest musician on the late-night [[variety show]] ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where he showcased his acting potentials. He also paired with American actor [[Jimmy Fallon]] on ''[[The Barry Gibb Talk Show]]''. After the show, Timberlake was reportedly "inundated" with acting offers, which he readily accepted partly because he needed inspiration and did not want to pass up the opportunities.&lt;ref name="rolling stone cover story"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Moss |first=Corey |title=Justin Timberlake: A New Justification |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/t/timberlake_justin/news_qa_060220/ |publisher=MTV News.

Viacom |accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2004, Timberlake then contacted record producers [[Rich Harrison]] and [[Rodney Jerkins]], who had produced songs for *NSYNC. Both producers were "impressed" by the live band-driven late-night shows Timberlake had participated in and wanted to incorporate this in his music.&lt;ref name="Moss6"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Moss |first=Corey |title=Justin's Talking With Hitmakers About His New LP |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1493494/20041105/timberlake_justin.jhtml |publisher=MTV News.

In 2005, Timberlake felt inspired to record songs again. Motivated by the "sad state" of pop radio, he decided he needed to experiment with music.&lt;ref name="rolling stone cover story"/&gt; Reportedly, it was not until Timberlake turned to producer [[Timbaland]] "that he figured out the direction he wanted the record to take".&lt;ref name="VineyardMTVFunk"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|title='Back' In Style: Justin Timberlake Mixes Funk, Rock On New Single|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1535791/justin-back-style-on-new-single.jhtml|accessdate=September 11, 2011|publisher=MTV News. Viacom|date=July 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2005, Timberlake visited Timbaland's brand-new [[Thomas Crown Studios]] in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], United States. Timbaland had previously collaborated with Timberlake, producing four tracks for ''Justified'' including "Cry Me a River".&lt;ref name="rolling stone cover story"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

Once in the studio, however, the team had no clear direction for the album as there were no concepts being discussed.&lt;ref name="Vineyard2"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |title=Justin Timberlake's Fooling 'Around' Resulted In Award-Nominated Song: Behind The Grammys |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1581045/20080206/timberlake_justin.jhtml |publisher=MTV News.

While in the studio, Timbaland played on the stereo plenty of songs by American singer and musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] for them to listen to. Early in their sessions, they reportedly were "fooling around" and "freestyling".&lt;ref name="Vineyard2"/&gt; One night, Danja was playing a guitar [[riff]] and caught the attention of Timberlake, who then started humming to the [[melody]] and later sung the lyrics. Timbaland, who was at their side, added drums onto the progressing sound. After an hour, with no lyrics written on paper, Timberlake recorded in the vocal booth a song that would become "[[What Goes Around... Comes Around]]".&lt;ref name="Vineyard2"/&gt; Timberlake, having been teased by Timbaland, said to the latter: "Let's do something we would never do. Let's go far left and just see what happens."&lt;ref name="mtvnews1"/&gt;

==Production==
Official production for ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' started in December 2005. When production began, [[Jive Records]] Chairman and CEO, [[Barry Weiss]], asked when the album would be completed, to which Timberlake replied that it could possibly take a year.{{sfn|Scaggs|2006|p=3}} The title was not finalized until Jive Records gave Timberlake a deadline on finishing what would become ''FutureSex/LoveSounds''.&lt;ref name="Moss3"/&gt; The collective thought the album is comparable with [[Michael Jackson]]'s landmark record, ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'', dubbing their own as ''Thriller 2006''.&lt;ref name="rolling stone cover story"/&gt;

According to Timberlake, ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' is like a "fashion editorial, [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|YSL]] and [[Gucci]] suits, which goes with the sonics".&lt;ref name="LongObserverSexy"/&gt; The album's artworks were shot by American fashion photographer [[Terry Richardson]].&lt;ref name="LongObserverSexy"/&gt; The cover features Timberlake stomping a [[disco ball]] using his black pointy shoe.

For his new project, Timberlake collaborated with only few producers.&lt;ref name="Moss3"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Moss |first=Corey |title=Justin Timberlake 'In A Good Place' With His Collabos |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1521577/20060125/timberlake_justin.jhtml |work=MTV News |date=January 25, 2006 |accessdate=May 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; With no concrete plans, however, Timberlake's goal for the album was "'to capture moments' with a vivid, raw, off-the-cuff sound".{{sfn|Moss|p=2}} Timberlake, who included [[Record producer|record production]] in his repertoire, managed the recording sessions with no formula.&lt;ref name="Moss3"/&gt; His sessions with Timbaland and Danja were described as free-flowing, and he referred to themselves in the process as "looking like [mad men], a mad scientist".{{sfn|Vineyard|2007}}

On his collaboration with Timbaland, Timberlake asserted that they "have a very interesting connection" in music.&lt;ref name="Moss3"/&gt; In ten days, they composed at least eight to ten songs with the lyrics, melodies, and vocals all in place. In three weeks, after that transitional moment with "What Goes Around... Comes Around", the collective was able to produce songs like "[[My Love (Justin Timberlake song)|My Love]]", "[[SexyBack]]", and "Sexy Ladies".{{sfn|Scaggs|2006|p=5}} Unlike ''Justified'' which was recorded in six weeks, Timberlake said that ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' took one year to complete.&lt;ref name="LongObserverSexy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Long|first=Camilla|title='I'm bringing back sexy'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jul/16/popandrock.justintimberlake?INTCMP=SRCH|work=The Observer|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=September 15, 2011|date=July 16, 2006|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sessions for the album also saw Timberlake collaborating with [[Rick Rubin]] and [[will.i.am]], the latter himself a member of the hip hop group [[The Black Eyed Peas]], whose 2003 single "[[Where Is the Love?]]" Timberlake lent vocals to. For the production, they are credited as Jawbreakers, a production team of their own established during their collaboration for The Black Eyed Peas' album.&lt;ref name="Moss3"/&gt; Four songs were produced with will.i.am,&lt;ref name="Moss3"/&gt; although only "Damn Girl" made it to the standard edition of the album.

Actor [[Chris Rock]] recommended producer Rubin to Timberlake, who considered the idea and discussed it with Rubin when he saw him at a music festival in [[Coachella, California]].&lt;ref name="Moss2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LongObserverSexy"/&gt; Timberlake went to singer-songwriter [[Neil Diamond]]'s studio, where Rubin played him some [[demo (music)|demos]], one of which was a [[ballad (music)|ballad]] that would become "(Another Song) All Over Again". Timberlake suggested that the collaboration was meant to "do the anti-whatever-you-want-to-call-it that [Timbaland and] I came up with".{{sfn|Moss|p=2}}

==Music==
During the production of ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'', Timberlake was interested in [[rock music]].{{sfn|Scaggs|2006|p=4}} This inspiration was used in his approach in recording the songs, rather than in composing them. Timberlake reveals, "I wanted to sing the song like a rock and roll singer, not an R&amp;B singer."&lt;ref name="VineyardMTVFunk"/&gt; On the influences he drew from, he said that if ''Justified'' was "characterized" by [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Stevie Wonder]], ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' is more like [[David Bowie]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].&lt;ref name="LongObserverSexy"/&gt; Other influences include late [[INXS]]-frontman [[Michael Hutchence]],{{sfn|Moss|p=2}} [[Arcade Fire]], [[David Byrne]], [[The Killers]], [[The Strokes]], and [[Radiohead]].{{sfn|Scaggs|2006|p=4}}

Although Timberlake expressed interest in recording songs with rock influences, Timbaland was initially reluctant to pursue the idea because he was not accustomed to producing such music.{{sfn|Vineyard|2007}} Nonetheless, he suggested that they could produce a handful, since they were afraid of alienating Timberlake's urban fan base.{{sfn|Vineyard|2007}} Because of this concern, they produced several [[reprise]]s, encores and [[prelude (music)|preludes]] with a rock influence, instead of full-length songs.{{sfn|Vineyard|2007}}
As to the sound of ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'', "[[My Love (Justin Timberlake song)|My Love]]", the second song composed, steered the album's direction. Danja revealed that it "changed the whole album",&lt;ref name="HovaVibeStudio"/&gt; and the energy derived from the song was sustained throughout the process. On his inspiration for the infusion of R&amp;B with [[trance music|trance]] on the album, Danja remembers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I heard [[Electronic dance music|dance]] and [[techno]] and was always interested in it but didn't really know where to go. But I went to a club one night and saw that people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't really that I wanted to mimic that sound. I just wanted to have that energy and have people going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R&amp;B with trance.&lt;ref name="HovaVibeStudio"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike his previous record that was intended to focus on [[contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] and [[pop music|pop]] [[genre]]s,{{sfn|Vineyard|2007}} ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' is less concentrated on one particular sound,&lt;ref name="Moss2"/&gt; thus representing a wider range. Timberlake explains, "It's more broad as far as the styles I wanted to mix in to my own type of thing."&lt;ref name="Moss2"/&gt; A musically "complex" album, ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' is a fusion of [[hip hop music|rap]], rock, [[funk]], [[soul music|soul]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[opera]], and [[world music]].&lt;ref name="LongObserverSexy"/&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' noted that the album's sound is a "sonic departure" from both *NSYNC and ''Justified''.{{sfn|Collis|2007|p=1}} Although "What Goes Around" sounds similar to ''Justified'', Timberlake admitted that it is the only song in the new album to have such similarity.{{sfn|Vineyard|2007}}
Critics noted that the influences and styles are varied across the album's track list. The title track "[[FutureSex/LoveSound]]" incorporates early 1980s [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[industrial rock]]. The song "Sexy Ladies" takes on [[Minneapolis sound|Minneapolis funk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caramanica|first=Jon|title=Justin Timberlake: FutureSex/LoveSounds|journal=Vibe|date=October 2006|volume=14|page=142|issn=1070-4701|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8iYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA142|accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another funk song on the album is the lead single "SexyBack", the style of which is described by Timberlake as "club funk".&lt;ref name="VineyardMTVFunk"/&gt; Meanwhile, the track "Damn Girl", which was produced by the Jawbreakers, incorporates '60s [[soul music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stack|first=Tim|title=WILL.I.AM Is Having a Moment|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1540511,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time, Inc|accessdate=September 14, 2011|date=September 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gospel (music)|Gospel music]] is infused in "Losing My Way", which is the only song on the album that features choir [[arrangement]].

==Lyrics==
[[File:RickRubinSept09.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Rick Rubin]] produced "(Another Song) All Over Again", the only song on the album that was written on paper.]]

Most of the songs' lyrics were not written down on paper,{{sfn|Vineyard|2007}} as Timberlake believed it would only slow him down.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; For most of the album's production, Timberlake composed the lyrics in his head and would record the song shortly after. Some songs were conceptualized within a relatively shorter time, while others took longer because Timberlake had wanted to incorporate variation. For instance, the lyrics to "Losing My Way" were in a narrative style which took Timberlake longer to write.{{sfn|Vineyard|2007}} The only song that Timberlake wrote down on paper was the [[Rick Rubin]]-produced "(Another Song) All Over Again". Rubin felt it was unusual for Timberlake because he requested the latter to write the lyrics first instead of recording it directly in the vocal booth.{{sfn|Vineyard|2007}}

Sharing common themes with ''Justified'', ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' contains songs that are thematically based on and, according to Timberlake, were motivated by sex and love.&lt;ref name="Vineyard3"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |title=Justin's Album Shows Off Two Sides: Over-The-Top Saucy, Unassumingly Sweet |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1539749/20060829/timberlake_justin.jhtml |work=MTV News |date=August 29, 2006 |accessdate=May 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MTV]] editor Jennifer Vineyard summarizes that the album illustrates "the very nature of how sex and love are interchangeable and immutable and contradictory and complementary all at once".&lt;ref name="Vineyard3"/&gt; The first half of the album, ''FutureSex'', generally focuses on themes about sex that are evident on songs like the title track "FutureSex/LoveSound", "LoveStoned", "Damn Girl" and "Sexy Ladies".&lt;ref name="Vineyard3"/&gt; The second half, ''LoveSounds'', is the album's "sweet side",&lt;ref name="Vineyard3"/&gt; encompassing songs such as "My Love", the [[slow jam]] "Until the End of Time" and "What Goes Around... Comes Around". Meanwhile, "LoveStoned" transitions to the two-minute prelude "I Think She Knows".&lt;ref name="Vineyard3"/&gt;

Although themes of sex and love are dominant on the album, the song "Losing My Way" diverges to a more serious topic, which was inspired by a [[documentary film|documentary]] of [[Methamphetamine|crystal meth]] addiction that Timberlake watched.&lt;ref name="Vineyard3"/&gt; Meanwhile, "(Another Song) All Over Again" is a homage to [[soul music|soul]] musician [[Donny Hathaway]], according to Timberlake.{{sfn|Moss|p=2}}
The lyrics to "What Goes Around... Comes Around" are thought to have similar meaning to "Cry Me a River". In an interview, he revealed that the song was based on one of his friends' experience.{{sfn|Moss|p=2}} "My Love" was also noted as "arguably" similar with "Cry Me a River".&lt;ref name="LongObserverSexy"/&gt; Timberlake however confirmed in many interviews that the record is not autobiographical, although he himself had an experience from which to draw.&lt;ref name="LongObserverSexy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vineyard3"/&gt;

==Singles==
Six major [[single (music)|singles]] were issued from the album, led by "[[SexyBack]]" which was released on July 7, 2006, two months prior to the publication of the album. Regarding the song, Timberlake surmised he did not sound like he did before.&lt;ref name="WeinerNYTLeading"&gt;{{cite news|last=Weiner|first=Jonah|title=Leading Man, Miles Beyond the Boy Band|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/movies/justin-timberlake-friends-with-benefits-bad-teacher.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;sq=Timberlake%20futuresex&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=13|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 11, 2011|page=2|date=July 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "SexyBack", which lacks his distinctive [[falsetto]], is seen as a complete departure from Timberlake's recognized sound,{{sfn|Collis|2007|p=3}} and his management thought it might risk being unrecognizable as a "Justin Timberlake song".&lt;ref name="WeinerNYTLeading"/&gt; But that risk nonetheless appealed to Timberlake,&lt;ref name="WeinerNYTLeading"/&gt; who reportedly insisted to have "SexyBack" released as the album's lead single.&lt;ref name="WeinerNYTLeading"/&gt; [[Jive Records]] executive Barry Weiss, who initially doubted the suggestion, later told in an interview in February 2007 that albeit an "unusual record", it was a "risk that clearly paid off".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vozick-Levinson|first=Simon|title=This Ain't No Jive|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20040784,00.html|accessdate=September 11, 2011|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time, Inc|date=May 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"SexyBack" was followed with the release of "[[My Love (Justin Timberlake song)|My Love]]" in the third quarter of 2006, and "[[What Goes Around... Comes Around]]" in early January 2007. The single releases for the standard edition of the album spanned a year, during which time the fourth single, "[[LoveStoned/I Think She Knows]]", was released. When the deluxe edition was issued, the duet version of "[[Until the End of Time (Justin Timberlake and Beyoncé Knowles song)|Until the End of Time]]" was also released in the same month. The single version includes as its [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] the "Set the Mood (Prelude)", which is juxtaposed with "[[Summer Love (Justin Timberlake song)|Summer Love]]" in the album's track listing. The European release of "Until the End of Time" omits "Set the Mood (Prelude)", and instead included "Summer Love" as double A-side.

Commercially, the album's first three singles have been the most successful in the domestic music market. They each peaked at number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], giving Timberlake credit as the only artist to achieve such feat since R&amp;B singer [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] accomplished four chart-topping singles between February and December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chart Beat |url=https://www.billboard.com/bbcom/chart_beat/bonus_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003548872 |work=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc |date=February 22, 2007 |accessdate=February 22, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070302081541/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/chart_beat/bonus_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003548872 |archivedate=March 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "SexyBack" and "My Love" have since been certified multi-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), an achievement that was seen as "rare" amidst free file-sharing in the Internet, which had made reaching the million mark in sales a struggle in the music industry.&lt;ref name="BrownEWWants"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Ethan|title=Everyone Wants Timbaland|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20015777,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time, Inc|accessdate=September 11, 2011|date=March 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tour==
[[File:Jtstpaul.jpg|thumb|Timberlake performing at [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], Minnesota, one of the venues of his first worldwide tour, the [[FutureSex/LoveShow]]]]
{{main|FutureSex/LoveShow}}
In support of the album, Timberlake embarked on the [[FutureSex/LoveShow]], his first concert tour on a global scale. Promoted primarily by [[AEG Live]], the concert tour reached North America, Europe, Asia and Oceania, with 119 venues in total. It began on January 8, 2007, in [[San Diego]], California, and culminated in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates]], on December 6, 2007. FutureSex/LoveShow, which drew 1.6 million people worldwide, grossed a total of [[United States Dollar|US$]]126.8 million, the third top-grossing concert tour in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Police Score Top-Grossing Tour Of '07|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1047044/the-police-score-top-grossing-tour-of-07|accessdate=September 11, 2011|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, it was announced that Timberlake signed a deal with [[HBO]] network to broadcast the live concert. Timberlake had previously appeared on HBO, which aired the [[No Strings Attached Tour|*NSYNC Live From Madison Square Garden]] concert in 2000. FutureSex/LoveShow was taped on the second night at the [[Madison Square Garden]] on August 16, 2007. The footage was broadcast by HBO on September 3, 2007, and later on September 6 due to demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=La Rocco|first=Claudia|title=For Pop Stars, Big Reputations Can Rest on the Smallest of Movements|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/05/arts/dance/05timb.html|work=The New York Times|date=September 5, 2007|accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 20, 2007, a two-disc edition of  ''[[FutureSex/LoveShow: Live from Madison Square Garden]]'' was released on DVD and Blu-ray formats that were sold exclusively by the retailer [[Best Buy]]. The release included extra footage including a song-by-song commentary by Timberlake and pre- and post-show clips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Orzeck|first=Kurt|title=Beyonce, Fall Out Boy, Nine Inch Nails, Nirvana, U2 And Gorillaz Kick-Start The Holiday Rush, In New Releases|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1574673/beyonce-fall-out-boy-nine-inch-nails-amp-more-new-releases.jhtml|accessdate=September 11, 2011|work=MTV News|date=November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the broadcast earned Timberlake an [[Emmy Award]] in the category Outstanding Picture Editing For A Special (Single Or Multi-Camera).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Justin Timberlake: FutureSex/Loveshow|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/justin-timberlake-futuresexloveshow|work=Emmys.com|accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Timberlake's performance of "What Goes Around... Comes Around" at the Madison Square Garden, [[Josh Tyrangiel]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine ranked it second on its list of top ten live performances in 2007. Tyrangiel writes, "It's a little on the long side, but Timberlake earns this symphonic take on What Goes Around from his HBO special."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tyrangiel|first=Josh|title=Top 10 Live Performances|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1686204_1686244_1690841,00.html|work=Time|accessdate=September 11, 2011|date=December 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 31, 2007, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine announced the finalists for the 2007 ''Billboard'' Touring Awards, which was based on actual box office performance from January 1, 2007, to September 30, 2007.

==Release and promotion==
''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' was released worldwide on September 13, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Justin Timberlake&amp;nbsp;– FutureSex/LoveSounds&amp;nbsp;– Album |url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/timberlake_justin/albums.jhtml?albumId=1337290|work=MTV|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than a year after its initial release, a deluxe edition of the album was issued on November 27, 2007.&lt;ref name="MTVStaff"&gt;{{Cite news |author=MTV News Staff |title=Justin Timberlake's Deluxe Sounds; Plus Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, 50 Cent, Ashlee Simpson &amp; More, In For The Record |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1571918/20071015/timberlake_justin.jhtml |work=MTV News |date=August 15, 2007 |accessdate=May 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This edition contains three additional tracks on the album, each featuring guest artist. One of the tracks is a re-recording of "[[Until the End of Time (Justin Timberlake and Beyoncé song)|Until the End of Time]]", now a duet between Timberlake and American R&amp;B singer [[Beyoncé]]. Also included with the Deluxe Edition is a bonus DVD, which contains footage from Timberlake's live performances and behind the scenes on the music videos of four singles, including "SexyBack" and "What Goes Around... Comes Around". The main album included with the Deluxe Edition is the edited version; and an explicit version was not issued.

According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine, Jive's mother company [[Sony BMG]] offered 71 distinct products to tie in with ''FutureSex/LoveSounds''. This was an attempt at finding solutions to declining sales in physical albums, and Timberlake's album was among those offered in various configurations and versions. Aside from the album itself, the project included digital versions, [[ringtones]], wallpapers and individual tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christman|first=Ed|title=New Wrinkles and Ringles|journal=Billboard|date=May 19, 2007|volume=199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JRMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Futuresex+Timberlake#v=onepage&amp;q=Futuresex%20Timberlake&amp;f=false|accessdate=September 4, 2011|page=7|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before, an artist's release was made available in less than ten formats.&lt;ref name="BargfredeLaw"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bargfrede|first=Allen|title=Music Law in the Digital Age|year=2009|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=978-0-87639-099-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6kZ4hbjQ7EC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Futuresex+Timberlake#v=onepage&amp;q=Future%20sex%20Timberlake&amp;f=false|author2=Mak, Cecily|accessdate=September 11, 2011|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, however, versioning strategies have been increasingly applied to the recording industry. On the 2010 book ''The Music Industry: Music in the Cloud'' which examines such context, author Patrik Wikström noted ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' as one "high-profile" example.&lt;ref name="WikströmCloud"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wikström|first=Patrik|title=The Music Industry: Music in the Cloud|year=2010|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-4390-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lrGfgm8IA7oC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=Futuresex+Timberlake#v=onepage&amp;q=Futuresex%20Timberlake&amp;f=false|edition=Illustrated, Reprint|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the project, a total of 115 versions or products have been sold.&lt;ref name="BargfredeLaw"/&gt; According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), the project has sold {{as of|2008|lc=y}} more than 19 million units worldwide, 20 percent of which were sales on CD format.&lt;ref name="WikströmCloud"/&gt;

''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' was met with generally positive reviews from critics.

==Legacy==
The success of ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' affected both Timberlake's and Timbaland's careers. For Timberlake, it further established his career as a solo artist. He comments, "'SexyBack' was the point when people stopped asking me when *NSYNC&lt;sup&gt;{{sic}}&lt;/sup&gt; were going to reunite and started asking what I was going to do next."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collis|first=Clark|title=Justin Timberlake: Entertainer of the Decade|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20324127,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time, Inc|accessdate=September 11, 2011|date=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timberlake has also beefed up his fan base, gaining "hipster" fans in the wake of the album's success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryzik|first=Melena|title=Timberlake, Pop Juggernaut, Is Gaining Some Unusual Fans|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/07/arts/music/07just.html?scp=13&amp;sq=justin+timberlake+futuresex&amp;st=nyt|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 18, 2011|date=February 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining the international success of Timberlake's ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' and [[Nelly Furtado]]'s ''[[Loose (Nelly Furtado album)|Loose]]'', demands for Timbaland's work reportedly surged.&lt;ref name="BrownEWWants"/&gt; Writing for ''Entertainment Weekly'', Chris Willman remarked that ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' is "like Timberlake's '[[credibility|cred]]' record",&lt;ref name="WillmanEWReview"&gt;{{cite news|last=Willman |first=Chris |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1532765,00.html |title=FutureSex/LoveSounds |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=September 11, 2006 |accessdate=December 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Chris Collis said Timbaland nearly stole the spotlight, sharing with Timberlake the "star" status.&lt;ref name="CollisEWRecord"&gt;{{cite news|last=Collis|first=Clark|title=Records of the Year|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20006509,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time, Inc|accessdate=September 14, 2011|date=December 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from earning critical acclaim for the album, according to Sia Michel of ''[[The New York Times]]'', Timberlake was responsible for popularizing in 2006 the catchphrase "I'm bringing sexy back",{{sfn|Collis|2007|p=1}}&lt;ref name="MichelNYTCommit"&gt;{{cite news|last=Michel|first=Sia|title=He's Bringing Commitment Back (and Not in a Box)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/09/arts/music/09timb.html?scp=11&amp;sq=Timberlake%20futuresex&amp;st=cse|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 11, 2011|date=February 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is culled from the lead single "SexyBack".

Justin is a leader, setting the bar for what's expected of others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The TIME 100|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1595326_1595332_1615988,00.html|work=Time|accessdate=September 11, 2011|author=Timbaland|date=May 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album has been added to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]'s musical library and archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.rockhall.com/catalog/70685084 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20160515190533/http://catalog.rockhall.com/catalog/70685084 |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 15, 2016 |title=FutureSex/LoveSounds [sound recording] / Justin Timberlake |accessdate=March 2, 2016 |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Barker of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' (2016) stated the album "helped recalibrate the sonic frequency of several years' worth of [[contemporary hit radio|pop-radio]] trends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/music/features/justin-timberlake-trolls-cant-stop-the-feeling-woody-allen-pharrell-1201898888/ |title=Justin Timberlake Talks 'Trolls,' Family Life and His New Album with Pharrell Williams |work=Variety |date=November 1, 2016 |accessdate=November 1, 2016 |author=Berker, Andrew |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161102015331/http://variety.com/2016/music/features/justin-timberlake-trolls-cant-stop-the-feeling-woody-allen-pharrell-1201898888/ |archivedate=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Maura Johnston from ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' called it an "ambitious classic", writing ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' "musically propelled the pop&amp;B genre with audio novellas, interlude twists, Timbaland's weirdo sound effects and that irresistible falsetto" and "embraced the hard/soft duality implied by the title to thrilling effect—and because of their mastery of that balancing act, ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' would go on to influence, if not define, much of the pop music that came after it." also adding it "pushed boundaries more forcefully than works by fellow crooners R. Kelly and Usher."&lt;ref name="vibelist"/&gt; For its 10th anniversary, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' editor Brittany Spanos wrote "Ten years ago, Timberlake destroyed any doubt of his artistry or potential with the mature, innovative ''FutureSex/LoveSounds''. The pop star experimented with R&amp;B, funk and rock to create a piece of music well ahead of its time. Today, the LP's influence can still be heard in everything from the worldly electro-soul of [[Zayn Malik]] to the moody sound of newcomers like [[Bryson Tiller]]. The album also signaled Timberlake's transition from pop hitmaker and Hollywood It Boy to a legitimate force as a musician and actor."&lt;ref name="rstone"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/justin-timberlakes-futuresexlovesounds-10-things-you-didnt-know-w438594 | title=Justin Timberlake's 'FutureSex/LoveSounds': 10 Things You Didn't Know | work=Rolling Stone | date=September 8, 2016 | accessdate=September 9, 2016 | author=Spanos, Brittany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"It changed the game. A bold departure from the warm, synthesized soul that The Neptunes helmed on ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]'', ''FutureSex'' was steely and sweaty, a universal dance opus that made room for intimacy. The album had some of Timbaland's smartest work as a producer, with beds of elastic funk and electro-pop for Timberlake to roll around in. The album also had adult themes and f-bombs, speeding up the transition from Curly-Haired Boy to Shaved-Head Man for Timberlake. And it was so blindingly successful, from blockbuster sales to hit singles to a huge tour to real critical acclaim, that the pop world grew deeply anxious while awaiting Timberlake's post-''FutureSex'' return, which finally occurred seven years later with ''[[The 20/20 Experience]]''. And still, to me, those are not the greatest achievements of Timberlake's 2006 album. Ten years later, it's more clear than ever: ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' had the best first half of any pop album in 25 years. You have to go back to 1979 for ''[[Off the Wall (album)|Off The Wall]]'', by JT's idol [[Michael Jackson]], to find a pop album with a first half that matches up."|[[Fuse TV]]'s music critic Jason Lipshutz writing for the 10th anniversary of the release.&lt;ref name="fuse"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fuse.tv/2016/01/justin-timberlake-futuresex-lovesounds-class-of-2006 | title=The Greatest Achievement of Justin Timberlake's 'FutureSex/LoveSounds' |work=Fuse | author=Lipshutz, Jason | date=January 26, 2016 | accessdate=February 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
