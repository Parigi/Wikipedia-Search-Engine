'''iMac''' is a family of [[All-in-One PC#All-in-one|all-in-one]] [[Macintosh]] [[desktop computer]]s designed and built by [[Apple Inc.]] It has been the primary part of Apple's consumer desktop offerings since its debut in August 1998, and has evolved through [[List of Macintosh models by case type|seven distinct forms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Olivarez-Giles |first=Nathan |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/05/apple-updates-imac-line-with-thunderbolt.html |title=Apple updates iMac line with quicker processors, graphics and Thunderbolt I/O |work=Los Angeles Times |date=May 3, 2011 |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its original form, the [[iMac G3]] had a [[gumdrop]] or [[Oval#Egg shape|egg-shaped]] look, with a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitor, mainly enclosed by a colored, [[Transparency and translucency|translucent]] plastic case, which was refreshed early on with a sleeker design notable for its [[Optical drive#Loading mechanisms|slot-loaded optical drive]]. The second major revision, the [[iMac G4]], moved the design to a hemispherical base containing all the main components and an [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] monitor on a freely moving arm attached to it. The third and fourth major revisions, the [[iMac G5]] and the [[iMac (Intel-based)|Intel iMac]] respectively, placed all the components immediately behind the display, creating a slim unified design that tilts only up and down on a simple metal base. The fifth major revision (mid-2007) shared the same form as the previous model, but was thinner and used [[anodized aluminum]] and a glass panel over the entire front. The sixth major revision (late 2012) uses a different display unit, omits the [[SuperDrive]], and uses different production techniques from the older unibody versions. This allows it to be thinner at the edge than older models, with an edge thickness of 5.9 mm (but the same maximum depth). It also includes a dual microphone setup, and includes [[solid-state drive]] (SSD) or hard disk storage, or an Apple [[Fusion Drive]], a hybrid of solid state and hard disk drives. This version of the iMac was announced in October 2012, with the {{convert|21.5|in|cm|adj=on}} version released in November and the {{convert|27|in|cm|adj=on}} version in December; these were refreshed in September 2013, with new [[Haswell (microarchitecture)|Haswell]] processors, faster graphics, faster and larger SSD options and [[IEEE 802.11ac|802.11ac]] Wi-Fi cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple Updates iMac|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2013/09/24Apple-Updates-iMac.html|publisher=Apple|accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, the seventh major revision of the {{convert|27|in|cm|adj=on}} iMac was announced, whose main feature is a "[[Retina Display|Retina]] [[5K_resolution|5K]]" display at a resolution of 5120 × 2880 pixels. The new model also includes a new processor, graphics chip, and IO, along with several new storage options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple Introduces 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K Display|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2014/10/16Apple-Introduces-27-inch-iMac-with-Retina-5K-Display.html|publisher=Apple|accessdate=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seventh major revision of the {{convert|21.5|in|cm|adj=on}} iMac was announced in October 2015. Its main feature is a "[[Retina Display|Retina]] [[4K_resolution|4K]]" display at a resolution of 4096 × 2304 pixels. It has the same new processor, graphics chip, and I/O as the 27-inch iMac, along with several new storage options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple adds retina display to new iMacs|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/personal/2015/10/13/apple-adds-retina-display-new-imac.html|publisher=Brett Molina|accessdate=October 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2017, Apple announced a workstation-class version of the iMac, called the "iMac Pro". The iMac Pro shares the design and screen of the 5K iMac, but is colored in Space Gray rather than silver. It comes with Intel [[Xeon]] processors and standard SSD storage. Apple began shipping the iMac Pro in December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Kastrenakes, Jacob (December 12, 2017). [https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/12/12/16766358/imac-pro-release-days-away-apple-phil-schiller "Apple’s iMac Pro will be available starting Thursday"]. ''[[The Verge]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The announcement of iMac in 1998 was a source of controversy and anticipation among commentators, Mac fans, and detractors. Opinions were divided over Apple's drastic changes to the Macintosh hardware. At the time, Apple had suffered a series of setbacks as consumers increasingly opted for [[Wintel]] (Windows PCs) machines instead of Apple's [[Performa]] models. Many in the industry thought that "beleaguered" Apple would soon be forced to start selling computers with a custom interface built on top of one or more potential operating system bases, such as [[Taligent]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], or [[Windows 98]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macspeedzone.com/archive/art/con/be.shtml|title=Apple Confidential: The Day They Almost Decided To Put Windows On The Mac Instead Of OS X!|quote=Hancock ordered her staff to consider Microsoft's Windows, Sun Microsystems' Solaris, and even the ill-fated Taligent, which Apple had handed off to partner IBM in December 1995. Hancock was partial to Unix-based Solaris, while COO Marco Landi preferred cutting a deal for Windows NT.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The designer behind iMac's case was [[Jonathan Ive]].&lt;ref&gt;Gladwell, Malcolm (November 14, 2011). [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/11/14/111114fa_fact_gladwell?currentPage=2 "The Tweaker: The real genius of Steve Jobs."] ''[[The New Yorker]]''. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken Segall was an employee at an L.A. ad agency handling Apple's account who came up with the name "iMac" and pitched it to Steve Jobs. After Jobs' death, Segall claimed Jobs preferred "MacMan" for the name of the computer, but after Segall pitched "iMac" to him twice, the name was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2012/06/04/man-behind-imac-name-simplicity.html | title = Man behind iMac name: Simplicity drives business growth | accessdate = March 30, 2013 | last = Hawley | first = Brenna | date = June 4, 2012 | work = Kansas City Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Segall says that the "i" stands for "[[Internet]]",&lt;ref name="Alyson Raletz"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/blog/2012/06/man-who-came-up-with-imac-name-tells.html?page=all | title = Man who came up with iMac name tells what the ‘i’ stands for | accessdate = March 30, 2013 | last = Raletz | first = Alyson | date = June 7, 2012 | work = Kansas City Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also represents the product as a personal and revolutionary device ('i' for "individuality" and "innovation").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BHPtoTctDY |title=The First iMac Introduction |publisher=YouTube |date=January 30, 2006 |accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apple later [[Internet-related prefixes|adopted the 'i' prefix]] across its consumer hardware and software lines, such as [[iPod]], [[iBook]] (later MacBook), [[iPhone]], [[iPad]] and various pieces of software such as the [[iLife]] suite and [[iWork]] and the company's media player/store, [[iTunes]].

Attention was given to the [[out-of-box experience]]: the user needed to go through only two steps to set up and connect to the Internet. "There's no step 3!" was the catch-phrase in a popular iMac commercial narrated by actor [[Jeff Goldblum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://www.theapplecollection.com/Collection/AppleMovies/mov/3_steps.html|title=iMac Bondi 3 steps|people=[[Jeff Goldblum]]|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|medium=Internet|access-date=April 24, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110184516/http://www.theapplecollection.com/Collection/AppleMovies/mov/3_steps.html|archive-date=November 10, 2006|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another commercial, dubbed "Simplicity Shootout", pitted seven-year-old Johann Thomas and his [[border collie]] Brodie, with an iMac, against Adam Taggart, a [[Stanford University]] [[MBA]] student, with an [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] Pavilion 8250, in a race to set up their computers. Johann and Brodie finished in 8 minutes and 15 seconds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wap.org/journal/imac/default.html |title=iMac Review: It's a Mac |publisher=Washington Apple Pi |date=December 13, 1998 |accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Adam was still working on it by the end of the commercial.

==Updates==

By 2005, it had become more and more apparent that IBM's development for the desktop implementation of PowerPC was grinding to a halt. Apple announced at the [[Worldwide Developers Conference]] that it would be [[Apple's transition to Intel processors|switching the Macintosh to the x86 architecture]] and Intel's line of Core processors.  The first Intel-equipped Macs were unveiled on January 10, 2006: the Intel iMac and the introductory MacBook Pro.  Within nine months, Apple had smoothly transitioned the entire Macintosh line to Intel.  One of the highly touted side benefits of this switch was the ability to run Windows on Mac hardware.[[File:Timeline of the product Apple iMac.svg|thumb|400px|The timeline of iMac from 1998 to 2015, comparing it with the original [[Macintosh 128K]] (1984). This chart shows the change of the physical characteristics and appearance of the product.]]

On July 27, 2010, Apple updated its line of iMacs to feature the new Intel Core "i-series" processors across the line. The 21.5" models now feature the [[Intel Core i3|Core i3]] processor, but these are upgradable to the Core i5. The high end 27" features a [[Intel Core i5|Quad-Core i5]] processor, which is upgradable to a [[Intel Core i7|Quad-Core i7]]. On this date Apple also announced its new "[[Apple Magic Trackpad]]" peripheral, a trackpad similar to that of MacBook Pro for use with iMac or any other Apple computer. Apple also introduced a AA NiMH battery charger intended to simplify the use of batteries in these peripherals. Apple offers an option to use a solid state drive instead of a large mechanical drive.

On May 3, 2011, Apple updated its iMac line with the introduction of Intel [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] technology and Intel Core [[Intel Core i5|i5]] and [[Intel Core i7|i7]] [[Sandy Bridge]] processors as well as a 1 mega pixel [[high definition video|high definition]] [[iSight|FaceTime]] camera, features which were first introduced in the [[MacBook Pro]] line in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/05/03imac.html |title=Apple Announces New iMac With Next Generation Quad-Core Processors, Graphics &amp; Thunderbolt I/O Technology |publisher=Apple |date=May 3, 2011 |accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 23, 2012, a new iMac was announced (for a November/December release) with a substantially thinner edge, new Apple [[Fusion Drive]], faster processors (Intel Core [[Intel Core i5|i5]] and [[Intel Core i7|i7]] [[Ivy Bridge (microarchitecture)|Ivy Bridge]]) and graphics along with updates to the ports, but with the same overall depth (stand depth: 8 inches (20.3&amp;nbsp;cm)). To reduce the edge, the [[SuperDrive]] was removed on these iMacs.

On October 16, 2014, a new version of the 27-inch (69&amp;nbsp;cm) iMac was announced, whose main feature is a "[[Retina Display|Retina 5K]]" display at a resolution of 5120 × 2880 pixels.&lt;ref name=Retina5KPixels&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple - iMac with Retina 5K display - Features|url=https://www.apple.com/imac-with-retina/features/|publisher=Apple Inc |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new model also includes a new [[Haswell (microarchitecture)|processor]], [[AMD Radeon Rx 200 Series|graphics chip]], and [[Input/output|I/O]], along with several new [[Computer data storage|storage]] options. This computer was designed with professional photographers and video editors in mind, with the 5K resolution allowing 4K video to be played at its native resolution in Final Cut Pro, with room for toolbars on the side.

On June 6, 2017, Apple’s 21.5-inch iMac, which has a "Retina 4K" display at a resolution of 4096 × 2304 pixels, and the latest Intel 7th generation i5 processor, was announced. The iMac has Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz supported, and 1 TB hard drive. Apple’s iMac with 4K display has Intel Core i5 quad-core processor with 3GHz or 3.4GHz clock speed. The RAM on board is 8GB, and it will support Turbo boost of up to 3.8GHz. This iMac has options of 1TB hard drive or 1TB Fusion Drive. This 21.5-inch iMac also has the option of Radeon Pro 555 with 2GB of video RAM for graphics or a Radeon Pro 560 with 4GB of video RAM. Apple’s 27-inch iMac with the 5K display comes with the quad-core Intel Core i5 processor, which is clocked at 3.4GHz, 3.5GHz or 3.8GHz. This iMac supports Turbo boost of up to 4.2Ghz, and comes with 8GB RAM option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gadgets/apple-new-macbook-pro-macbook-imac-2017-price-in-india-now-out-specs-features-4692592/|title=Apple new MacBook Pro, MacBook, iMac Price in India now out|date=2017-06-07|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March of 2019, Apple updated the iMac to feature 9th-generation Intel Core i9 processors and Radeon Vega graphics. Unlike most other Apple releases, Apple opted not to announce the iMac at an event, rather to update the specs and release a press statement. For the first time, the iMac can support 6-core or 8-core Intel processors. Apple claims the 21.5-inch model is up to 60% faster than the previous model, and the 27-inch is up to 2.4 times faster. The exterior of the machine remained the same as the previous model.

== Influence ==

The [[iMac G3|original iMac]] was the first [[legacy-free PC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Compaq Hopes to Follow the iMac|url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/compaq-hopes-to-follow-the-imac/104658|first=John G.|last=Spooner|date=December 16, 1999|work=[[ZDNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first Macintosh computer to have a [[USB]] port but no [[floppy disk drive]]. Subsequently, all Macs have included USB. Via the USB port, hardware makers could make products compatible with both x86 PCs and Macs. Previously, Macintosh users had to seek out certain hardware, such as keyboards and mice specifically tailored for the "old world" Mac's unique [[Apple Desktop Bus|ADB]] interface and printers and modems with [[Mini-DIN connector#8-pin|MiniDIN-8]] serial ports. Only a limited number of models from certain manufacturers were made with these interfaces, and often came at a premium price. USB, being cross-platform, has allowed Macintosh users to select from a large selection of devices marketed for the [[Wintel]] PC platform, such as [[USB hub|hubs]], [[image scanner|scanners]], [[data storage device|storage devices]], [[USB flash drives]], and [[Mouse (computing)|mice]]. After the iMac, Apple continued to remove older peripheral interfaces and floppy drives from the rest of its product line.

Borrowing from the 1997 [[Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh]], the various LCD-based iMac designs continued the all-in-one concept first envisioned in Apple's original Macintosh computer. The successful iMac allowed Apple to continue targeting the [[Power Macintosh]] line at the high-end of the market. This foreshadowed a similar strategy in the notebook market when the iMac-like [[iBook]] was released in 2006. Since then, the company has continued this strategy of differentiating the consumer versus professional product lines. Apple's focus on design has allowed each of its subsequent products to create a distinctive identity. Apple avoided using the beige colors then pervading the PC industry. The company would later drift from the multicolored designs of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The latter part of the decade saw Apple using [[Anodizing|anodized]] aluminum; glass; and white, black, and clear [[polycarbonate]] plastics among their build materials. Today many PCs are more design-conscious than before the iMac's introduction, with multi-shaded design schemes being common, and some desktops and laptops available in colorful, decorative patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/135017/2008/08/imacanniversary.html |title=Eight ways the iMac changed computing |accessdate=August 27, 2008 |work=[[Macworld]] |date=August 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's use of translucent, candy-colored plastics inspired similar [[industrial design]]s in other consumer products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2008/09/gallery-imac-anniversary/ |title=10 Years of Cuddly, Friendly iMacs |work=Wired |first=Benj |last=Edwards |date=September 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple's later introduction of the iPod, iBook G3 (Dual USB), and iMac G4 (all featuring snowy-white plastic), inspired similar designs in other companies' consumer electronics products. The color rollout also featured two distinctive ads: one called 'Life Savers' featured the [[Rolling Stones]] song, "[[She's a Rainbow]]" and an advertisement for the white version had the introduction of [[Cream (band)|Cream]]'s "[[White Room]]" as its backing track{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.

==Reception==

iMac has received considerable critical acclaim, including praise from technology columnist [[Walt Mossberg]] as the "Gold Standard of desktop computing";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Apple faced a class-action lawsuit filed in 2008 for allegedly deceiving the public by promising millions of colors from the LCD screens of all Mac models while its 20-inch model only held 262,144 colors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/03/31/apple_hit_with_another_millions_of_colors_lawsuit.html Apple sued over 20 inch iMac marketing being incorrect and using a less efficient screen type.] Apple insider, March 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This issue arose due to the use of 6-bit per pixel [[Liquid crystal display#Twisted nematic (TN)|Twisted nematic LCD]] screens. The case was dismissed on January 21, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|url=http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?page=1&amp;xmldoc=20091650672cjfsupp2d978_11563.xml |litigants=Sanders v.

While not a criticism of iMac ''per se'', the integrated design has some inherent tradeoffs that have garnered criticism. In ''The Mythical Midrange Mac Minitower'', Dan Frakes of ''Macworld'' suggests that with iMac occupying the midrange of Apple's product line, Apple has little to offer consumers who want some ability to expand or upgrade their computers, but do not need (or cannot afford) the [[Mac Pro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frakes |first=Dan |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/58562/2007/06/midrangemac.html |title=The Mythical Midrange Mac Minitower |work=Macworld |accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, iMac's integration of monitor and computer, while convenient, commits the owner to replacing both at the same time. For a time before the [[Mac mini]]'s introduction, there were rumors of a "headless iMac"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bangeman |first=Eric |url=https://arstechnica.com/old/content/2004/12/4488.ars |title=Apple supposedly prepping cheap "headless iMac" |publisher=ARStechnica |date=December 29, 2004 |accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the G4 Mac mini as introduced had lower performance compared to the iMac, which at the time featured a G5 processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1042363/macminireview.html |title=Mac mini: Perfect Bookshelf Box for Mac Minimalists |first=Jennifer |last=Berger |work=[[Macworld]] |date=January 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some third party suppliers such as [[Other World Computing]] provide upgrade kits that include specialized tools for working on iMacs.

Similarly, though the graphics chipset in some Intel models is on a removable [[Mobile PCI Express Module|MXM]], neither Apple nor third parties have offered retail iMac [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] upgrades, with the exception of those for the original iMac G3's "mezzanine" PCI slot. Models after iMac G5 (excluding the August 7, 2007 iMac update) made it difficult for the end-user to replace the hard disk or optical drive, and Apple's warranty explicitly forbids upgrading the socketed CPU. While conceding the possibility of a minitower cannibalizing sales from the Mac Pro, Frakes argues there is enough frustration with iMac's limitations to make such a proposition worthwhile. This disparity has become more pronounced after the G4 era since the bottom-end Power Mac G5 (with one brief exception) and Mac Pro models have all been priced in the US$1999–2499 range, while base model Power Macs G4s and earlier were US$1299–1799. The current generation iMac has Intel 5th generation i5 and i7 processors, ranging from quad core 2.7&amp;nbsp;GHz i5 to a quad core 3.4&amp;nbsp;GHz i7 processor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/imac/specs/ |title=iMac Technical Specifications |date=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it is possible to upgrade the 2010 edition of the iMac quite easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Upgrade+iMac+Intel+Core+i3+CPU+to+Core+i7/8670/1 |title=Upgrade iMac Intel Core i3 CPU to Core i7 |first=Stephen |last=Rawlins |work=EnglandGreen |date=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
