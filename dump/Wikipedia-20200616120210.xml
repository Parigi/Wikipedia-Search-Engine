For the background information, causes, effects and policy responses see [[Financial crisis of 2007–08]]. For a timeline see [[Subprime crisis impact timeline]].

==Prelude==

The [[subprime mortgage crisis]] reached a critical stage during the first week of September 2008, characterized by severely contracted [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] in the global credit markets&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080930/credit_markets.html Banks in Miser Mode] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003212714/http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080930/credit_markets.html |date=October 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and insolvency threats to investment banks and other institutions.

==US Government takeover of home mortgage lenders==
{{main article|Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac}}
The United States director of the [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]] (FHFA), [[James B. Lockhart III]], on September 7, 2008 announced his decision to place two United States [[Government-owned corporation|government-sponsored enterprises]] (GSEs), [[Fannie Mae]] (Federal National Mortgage Association) and [[Freddie Mac]] (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation), into [[conservatorship]] run by FHFA.&lt;ref name="USTreasury-Paulson-2008-09-07"&gt;{{cite press release |first=Henry M., Jr. |last=Paulson |title=Statement by Secretary Henry M.

He further said that "I attribute the need for today's action primarily to the inherent conflict and flawed business model embedded in the GSE structure, and to the ongoing [[United States housing market correction|housing correction]]."&lt;ref name="USTreasury-Paulson-2008-09-07" /&gt; The same day, [[Federal Reserve Bank]] Chairman [[Ben Bernanke]] stated in support: "I strongly endorse both the decision by FHFA Director Lockhart to place Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship and the actions taken by Treasury Secretary Paulson to ensure the financial soundness of those two companies."&lt;ref name="Federal Reserve-Bernanke-2008-09-07"&gt;{{cite news | first= Ben S. | last= Bernanke | title= Statement by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben S.

==Developing global financial crisis==
{{Main article|Financial crisis of 2007-08}}
[[Image:Dowjones crash 2008.svg|thumb|right|250px|Dow Jones Industrial Average Jan 2006 - Nov 2008]]
Beginning with [[bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers]] at midnight  Monday, September 15, 2008, the financial crisis entered an acute phase marked by failures of prominent American and [[Europe]]an banks and efforts by the American and European governments to rescue distressed financial institutions, in the United States by passage of the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] and in European countries by infusion of capital into major banks. Afterwards, [[Iceland]] almost claimed to go bankrupt as the country's three largest banks, and in effect financial system, collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iceland.org/info/faq/banks/ "Financial Crisis in Iceland: Affected Banks"]&lt;/ref&gt; Many financial institutions in Europe also faced the [[liquidity]] problem that they needed to raise their capital adequacy ratio. As the crisis developed, stock markets fell worldwide, and global financial regulators attempted to coordinate efforts to contain the crisis. The US government composed a $700 billion plan to purchase unperforming [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]s and assets. However, the plan failed to pass because some members of the [[US Congress]] rejected the idea of using taxpayers' money to bail out [[Wall Street]] investment bankers. After the stock market plunged, Congress amended the $700 billion bail out plan and passed the legislation. The market sentiment continued to deteriorate, however, and the global financial system almost collapsed. While the market turned extremely pessimistic, the British government launched a 500 billion pound bail out plan aimed at injecting capital into the financial system. The British government nationalized most of the financial institutions in trouble. Many European governments followed suit, as well as the US government. Stock markets appeared to have stabilized as October ended. In addition, the falling prices due to reduced demand for [[oil]], coupled with projections of a global recession, brought the [[2000s energy crisis]] to temporary resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Jolly | first = David | author-link = | publication-date = October 10, 2008 | title = Oil Closes Below $78 as Demand Forecast Is Cut | newspaper = The New York Times | pages = B8 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/11/business/worldbusiness/11oil.html | accessdate = 2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Krauss | first = Clifford | author-link = | publication-date = October 13, 2008 | title = Commodity Prices Tumble | newspaper = The New York Times | pages = | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/14/business/economy/14commodities.html | accessdate = 2009-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Eastern Europe]]an economies of [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], and [[Ukraine]] the economic crisis was characterized by difficulties with loans made in hard currencies such as the [[Swiss franc]]. As local currencies in those countries lost value, making payment on such loans became progressively more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=awd1vGnyyBJQ "`Panic' Strikes East Europe Borrowers as Banks Cut Franc Loans"] article by Ben Holland, Laura Cochrane and Balazs Penz; ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'', October 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

As the financial panic developed during September and October 2008, there was a "[[flight-to-quality]]" as investors sought safety in [[U.S. Treasury bonds]], [[gold]], and currencies such as the US dollar (still widely perceived as the world’s reserve currency) and the [[Yen]] (mainly through unwinding of carry trades). This currency crisis threatened to disrupt international trade and produced strong pressure on all world currencies. The [[International Monetary Fund]] had limited resources relative to the needs of the many nations with currency under pressure or near collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

However, as events progressed during early 2009, it was U.S. Treasury bonds which were the main refuge chosen. This inflow of money into the United States translated into an outflow from other countries restricting their ability to raise money for local rescue efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Major US financial firms' crisis==
[[Image:Lehman Brothers Times Square by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|200px|The collapse of [[Lehman Brothers]] was a symbol of the global financial crisis]]

On Sunday, September 14, it was announced that [[Lehman Brothers]] would file for bankruptcy after the Federal Reserve Bank declined to participate in creating a financial support facility for Lehman Brothers. The significance of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy is disputed with some assigning it a pivotal role in the unfolding of subsequent events. The principals involved, Ben Bernanke and Henry Paulson, dispute this view, citing a volume of toxic assets at Lehman which made a rescue impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/business/economy/16bernanke.html | title=Bernanke Says Bailout Will Need Time to Work | publisher=The New York Times | date=2008-10-15 | accessdate=2008-10-15 | first=Michael M. | last=Grynbaum }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/business/economy/23paulson.html | title=Struggling to Keep Up as the Crisis Raced On | publisher=The New York Times | date=2008-10-22 | accessdate=2008-10-23 | first=Joe | last=Nocera |author2=Edmund L. Andrews}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately following the bankruptcy, [[JPMorgan Chase]] provided the broker dealer unit of [[Lehman Brothers]] with $138 billion to "settle securities transactions with customers of Lehman and its clearance parties" according to a statement made in a New York City Bankruptcy court filing.&lt;!-- Please explain on the talk page why the following sentence is notable, besides the fact that the blogosphere doesn't understand what it means. Is it the only time the fed has backed such transactions during a bankruptcy?  Did the Fed pay it or only guarantee that JP Morgan would pay it?  There is no indication that this is any different from normal: "The cash advance was backed the Federal Reserve Bank of NY."--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aX7mhYCHmVf8&amp;refer=home | title=JPMorgan Gave Lehman $138 Billion After Bankruptcy | publisher=Bloomberg | date=2008-09-16 | accessdate=2008-09-16 | first=Tiffany | last=Kary | author2=Chris Scinta | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920014104/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087 | archivedate=2008-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same day, the sale of [[Merrill Lynch]] to [[Bank of America]] was announced.&lt;ref name="Lehman Merrill"&gt;
[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/business/15lehman.html "Lehman Files for Bankruptcy; Merrill Is Sold"] article by Andrew Ross Sorkin in ''[[The New York Times]] September 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the week was marked by extreme instability in global stock markets, with dramatic drops in market values on Monday, September 15, and Wednesday, September 17. On September 16, the large insurer [[American International Group]] (AIG), a significant participant in the [[credit default swap]]s markets, suffered a [[liquidity crisis]] following the downgrade of its credit rating. The [[Federal Reserve]], at [[AIG]]'s request, and after AIG had shown that it could not find lenders willing to save it from insolvency, created a credit facility for up to US$85 billion in exchange for a 79.9% equity interest, and the right to suspend dividends to previously issued common and preferred stock.&lt;ref&gt;See [[American International Group]] for details and citations.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Money market funds insurance and short sales prohibitions===
On September 16, the [[Reserve Primary Fund]], a large [[money fund|money market mutual fund]], lowered its share price below $1 because of exposure to Lehman debt securities. This resulted in demands from investors to return their funds as the financial crisis mounted.&lt;ref name="NYT-Bernard-2008-09-17"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/business/yourmoney/18money.html "Money Market Funds Enter a World of Risk"] article by Tara Siegel Bernard in ''[[The New York Times]] September 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; By the morning of September 18, money market sell orders from institutional investors totalled $0.5 trillion, out of a total market capitalization of $4 trillion, but a $105 billion liquidity injection from the Federal Reserve averted an immediate collapse.&lt;ref name="NYPost-Gray-2008-09-18"&gt;Gray, Michael.

===US Troubled Asset Relief Program===
{{main article|Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|Troubled Assets Relief Program}}
On September 19, 2008 a plan intended to ameliorate the difficulties caused by the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] was proposed by the Secretary of the Treasury, [[Henry Paulson]]. He proposed a [[Troubled Assets Relief Program]] (TARP), later incorporated into the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|Emergency Economic Stabilization Act]], which would permit the United States government to purchase [[Market liquidity|illiquid]] assets, informally termed ''toxic assets'', from financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/business/19fed.html "Vast Bailout by U.S. Proposed in Bid to Stem Financial Crisis"] article by Edmund L.

Consultations between the [[Secretary of the Treasury]], the [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]], and the Chairman of the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]], Congressional leaders and the [[George W. Bush|President of the United States]] moved forward plans to advance a comprehensive solution to the problems created by illiquid mortgage-backed securities.  Of this time the President later said: "... I was told by [my] chief economic advisors that the situation we were facing could be worse than the [[Great Depression]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175023/greater_than_the_great_depression_ Greater than the great depression]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/13/nation/na-bush-press-conference-excerpt Bush Press Conference ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clipsandcomment.com/2009/01/12/transcript-president-george-w-bush-final-press-conference-january-12-2009/ Bush Press Conference Transcript]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the close of the week the Secretary of the Treasury and President Bush announced a proposal for the federal government to buy up to US$700 billion of illiquid [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] with the intent to increase the liquidity of the [[secondary mortgage market]]s and reduce potential losses encountered by financial institutions owning the securities. The draft proposal of the plan was received favorably by investors in the stock market. Details of the bailout remained to be acted upon by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/business/20fed.html "Bush Officials Urge Swift Action on Rescue Powers"] article by Edmund L.

==Week of September 21==
On Sunday, September 21, the two remaining US [[investment bank]]s, [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Morgan Stanley]], with the approval of the Federal Reserve, converted to [[bank holding company|bank holding companies]], a status subject to more regulation, but with readier access to capital.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/22/business/22bank.html "Shift for Goldman and Morgan Marks the End of an Era"] article by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Vikas Bajaj in ''[[The New York Times]]'' September 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On September 21, Treasury Secretary [[Henry Paulson]] announced that the original proposal, which would have excluded foreign banks, had been widened to include foreign financial institutions with a presence in the US. The US administration was pressuring other countries to set up similar bailout plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Schwartz | first = Nelson D. |author2=Carter Dougherty | title = Foreign Banks Hope Bailout Will Be Global | work = The New York Times | date = 2008-09-22 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/22/business/22global.html?hp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday and Tuesday during the week of September 22, appearances were made by the US Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve before Congressional committees and on Wednesday a prime-time presidential address was delivered by the President of the United States on television. Behind the scenes, negotiations were held refining the proposal which had grown to 42 pages from its original 3 and was reported to include both an oversight structure and limitations on executive salaries, with other provisions under consideration.

==Key risk indicators in September==
[[Image:TED spread 2008.svg|thumb|The [[TED spread]] – an indicator of credit risk – increased dramatically during September 2008.]]

Key risk indicators became highly volatile during September 2008, a factor leading the U.S. government to pass the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]]. The “[[TED spread]]” is a measure of credit risk for inter-bank lending. It is the difference between: 1) the risk-free three-month U.S. treasury bill rate; and 2) the three-month London InterBank Offered Rate ([[LIBOR]]), which represents the rate at which banks typically lend to each other. A higher spread indicates banks perceive each other as riskier counterparties. The t-bill is considered "risk-free" because the full faith and credit of the U.S. government is behind it; theoretically, the government could just print money so that the principal is fully repaid at maturity. The TED spread reached record levels in late September 2008. The diagram indicates that the Treasury yield movement was a more significant driver than the changes in LIBOR. A three-month t-bill yield so close to zero means that people are willing to forgo interest just to keep their money (principal) safe for three months – a very high level of risk aversion and indicative of tight lending conditions. Driving this change were investors shifting funds from money market funds (generally considered nearly risk free but paying a slightly higher rate of return than t-bills) and other investment types to t-bills.&lt;ref name="Gullapalli"&gt;Gullapalli, Diya and Anand, Shefali. [http://wsj.com/article/SB122186683086958875.html?mod=article-outset-box "Bailout of Money Funds Seems to Stanch Outflow"], [[The Wall Street Journal]], September 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These issues are consistent with the September 2008 aspects of the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] which prompted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush on October 2, 2008.

In addition, an increase in LIBOR means that financial instruments with variable interest terms are increasingly expensive. For example, car loans and [[credit card interest]] rates are often tied to LIBOR; some estimate as much as $150 trillion in loans and [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] are tied to LIBOR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/libor-jump-ted-spread-show/story.aspx?guid={3632A7B4-4B54-4AF5-86C2-78EFA350E927} Markewatch Article - LIBOR Jumps to Record]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the basis swap between one-month LIBOR and three-month LIBOR increased from 30 basis points in the beginning of September to a high of over 100 basis points. Financial institutions with liability exposure to 1 month LIBOR but funding from 3 month LIBOR faced increased funding costs. Overall, higher interest rates place additional downward pressure on consumption, increasing the risk of recession.
