"'''TKO'''" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Justin Timberlake]] for his fourth [[studio album]], ''[[The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2]]'' (2013). It was written and produced by Timberlake, [[Timbaland|Timothy "Timbaland" Mosley]] and [[Jerome "J-Roc" Harmon]], with additional writing from [[James Fauntleroy]] and a sample of [[Barry White]]'s "Somebody's Gonna off the Man". The song was distributed on September 20, 2013 by [[RCA Records]], as the second single from ''The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2''. A remix of the track by rappers [[J. Cole]], [[ASAP Rocky]] and [[Pusha T]], known as the "Black Friday Remix", was also released. The lyrics use boxing metaphors to explain how somebody being knocked out feels to them when they see their ex out with another guy.

"TKO" entered the top 40 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], where it reached number 36. The song was eventually certified Gold by [[Music Canada]]. The seven-minute official accompanying music video was released in October 2013, and stars [[Elvis Presley]]'s granddaughter [[Riley Keough]] as Timberlake's love interest.

== Production and composition ==
"TKO" was written and produced by [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Timbaland]] and [[Jerome "J-Roc" Harmon]], with [[James Fauntleroy]] also serving as co-writer of the track. The song samples [[Barry White]]'s "Somebody's Gonna Off the Man". Jerome Harmon performed as keyboardist, while Elliot Ives played the guitar. Justin Timberlake handled production and arrangement of his vocals, which were recorded at Larrabee Studios in [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles|North Hollywood]]. The track was engineered by Chris Godbey, and mixed by Jimmy Douglass, Godbey and Timberlake at Larabee Studios, with assistance from Alejandro Baima,&lt;ref name="Album Credits"&gt;{{cite AV media notes |title=The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2|others=[[Justin Timberlake]] |year=2013 |type=booklet |publisher=[[RCA Records]], a division of [[Sony Music Entertainment]] |location=[[New York City]], NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song contains heavy drums and "scratchy" studio effects, which according to a staff writer of ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'', is reminiscent of a "slightly more refined ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2013/09/listen-to-new-justin-timberlake-t-k-o |title=Listen to new Justin Timberlake: "T K O" |publisher=[[Consequence of Sound]] |date=September 20, 2013 |accessdate=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Jocelyn Vena of ''[[MTV News]]'', "Timberlake wasn't lying when he said that this album would be 'more dangerous' than part 1 of the [[The 20/20 Experience|20/20 Experience]], as evidenced by 'TKO,' writing that, "The track is a Timberlake/Timbaland joint, with signature bleepy production and dark undertones, a far cry from the album's lead single, upbeat throwback jam '[[Take Back the Night (song)|Take Back the Night]]'."&lt;ref name=mtvnews/&gt;

Lyrically, "TKO" leans heavy on boxing metaphors, specially with the title "TKO", which means [[technical knockout]], to describe the feeling of being knocked out when he sees his ex out with another guy,&lt;ref name="popcrush"/&gt; with lines like "I'm out for the count, yeah girl you knock me out."&lt;ref name=billboardtko/&gt; During the song, Timberlake sings, "It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie/ Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy/ Can't fight, knocked down, then I got over you/ Can't fight no more, you knock me out/ What am I supposed to do?." The song is punctuated by beat-boxing and Timbaland repeating the line, "Kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo."&lt;ref name=mtvnews&gt;{{cite news|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|title=Justin Timberlake Knocks Fans Out With New Track, 'T.K.O.'|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1714355/justin-timberlake-tko-new-single.jhtml|accessdate=January 1, 2014|newspaper=[[MTV News]]|date=September 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Release ==
After releasing "[[Take Back the Night (song)|Take Back the Night]]" as the first single from the second part of ''[[The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2|The 20/20 Experience]]'' album, Timberlake faced controversy for its title, due to the "[[Take Back the Night Foundation|Take Back the Night]] foundation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/07/timberlake-controversy-take-back-the-night|title=Justin Timberlake Addresses Controversy Surrounding "Take Back the Night" Single|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|publisher=Complex Media|last=Nostro|first=Lauren|date=July 16, 2013|accessdate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, on September 19, 2013, the singer teased his fans with an [[Instagram]] post, saying, "Should I release a new single today???."&lt;ref name=instagram1&gt;{{cite news|title=Justin Timberlake on Instagram|url=http://instagram.com/p/ecrhscydm8/|accessdate=January 1, 2014|newspaper=[[Instagram]]|date=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he posted another photo, saying, "Get Ready...", attached to a photo of him in the studio recording a song.&lt;ref name=instagram2&gt;{{cite news|title=Justin Timberlake on Instagram|url=http://instagram.com/p/ecy1ZNydhl/|accessdate=January 1, 2014|newspaper=[[Instagram]]|date=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five hours later, Timberlake posted a tease of the track with a 15-second snippet.&lt;ref name=ryanseacrest&gt;{{cite news|last=Perricone|first=Kathleen|title=Justin Timberlake Teases Next Single on Instagram Video|url=http://www.ryanseacrest.com/2013/09/19/justin-timberlake-teases-next-single-on-instagram-video/|accessdate=January 1, 2014|newspaper=[[Ryan Seacrest]]|date=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To finish the teasing, the singer posted the single's cover art, saying, "You ready to hear it in full???," also revealing its title: "TKO".&lt;ref name=instagram3&gt;{{cite web|title=You ready to hear it in full??? #TKO #newsingle|url=http://instagram.com/p/edqIa_Sdo9/|work=[[Instagram]]|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 20, 2013, the single was released.&lt;ref name=billboardtko&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|first=Billboard|title=Justin Timberlake Hits Fans With 'TKO': Listen|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5719243/justin-timberlake-hits-fans-with-tko-listen|accessdate=January 1, 2014|newspaper=[[Billboard Magazine]]|date=September 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A remix of "TKO", subtitled the "Black Friday Remix", premiered on November 29, 2013. It features new rap verses from [[J. Cole]], [[ASAP Rocky]] and [[Pusha T]]. Cole starts the song off and responds to [[Kendrick Lamar]]'s "Control" verse while also borrowing the [[Migos]] flow à la [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]] on the "[[Versace (song)|Versace]]" remix. Rocky jumps in next and delivers some slick bars before Pusha addresses what everyone will be talking about come December. "All this album of the year talk/Niggas claiming they the best out," he barks before making his own case.&lt;ref name=complex&gt;{{cite news|last=Ortiz|first=Edwin|title=Premiere: Justin Timberlake f/ J.

== Critical reception ==

"TKO" received mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. In a favorable review of the song for PopCrush, Amy Sciarretto wrote that "TKO" "would have been quite comfortable nestled in the track listing of ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]'' or ''[[FutureSex/LoveSounds]]''," however, Timberlake isn't recycling old music material, but giving it a modernized update. She added that the song is essentially this decade's "[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]".&lt;ref name="popcrush"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popcrush.com/justin-timberlake-tko-song-review/ |title=Justin Timberlake, 'TKO' - Song Review |publisher=PopCrush |first=Amy |last=Sciarretto |date=September 20, 2013 |accessdate=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James Shotwell of ''Under the Gun Review'', the song is "not what you would call a conventional single choice," but an infectious  Timbaland-built production: "There is something about how the heavy bass and snare blends with JT’s signature voice that taps into the soul of every pop music fan when Timbaland is in the mix that simply cannot be denied." He also expressed his opinion that "TKO" was far superior to Timberlake's previous single, "[[Take Back the Night (song)|Take Back the Night]]".&lt;ref name="under the gun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underthegunreview.net/2013/09/20/required-listening-justin-timberlake-tko/ |title=Required Listening: Justin Timberlake – "TKO" |publisher=Under the Gun Review |first=James |last=Shotwell |date=September 20, 2013 |accessdate=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a less enthusiastic review, Tom Breihan of [[Stereogum]] commented that the song "works as a midtempo club track that doesn’t have much of the old-school loverman slickness that Timberlake brought to the last album," referring to ''[[The 20/20 Experience]]'', and that "the melody doesn’t quite stick the way you’d hope a Timberlake melody would."&lt;ref name="stereogum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1483951/justin-timberlake-tko/mp3s/ |title=Justin Timberlake – "TKO" |publisher=[[Stereogum]] |first=Tom |last=Breihan |date=September 20, 2013 |accessdate=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sal Cinquemani of [[Slant Magazine]] called the track "another underwhelming single" and "a retread of Timberlake's past work with longtime collaborator Timbaland." However, he commented that the second half of the song is slightly more sonically interesting.&lt;ref name="slant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2013/20/single-review-justin-timberlake-tko |title=Single Review: Justin Timberlake, "TKO" |publisher=[[Slant Magazine]] |first=Sal |last=Cinquemani |date=September 20, 2013|accessdate=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annie Zaleski of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote the song is "sunk by both its tired boxing clichés and chattering Timbaland beats that break no new ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/justin-timberlake-the-2020-experience2-of-2,103532/ |title=Justin Timberlake: The 20/20 Experience—2 of 2 &amp;#124; Music &amp;#124; MusicalWork Review |last=Zaleski |first=Annie |work=[[The A.V. Club]] |date=October 1, 2013 |accessdate=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle Jackson of [[Common Sense Media]] was disappointed, writing that, "JT is notably lacking the swagger that has made him an icon. The lyrics are repetitive and heavily reliant upon weak metaphors and predictable songwriting, and the production is uninteresting at best, monotonous at worst."&lt;ref name = "Common Sense Media"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Kyle|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/music-reviews/tko|title="TKO" - Music Review|work=[[Common Sense Media]]|accessdate=December 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial performance==
In its first week of release, the single sold 79,000 downloads in the US, debuting at number 54 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/5740583/chart-moves-ylvis-the-fox-scampers-up-hot-100-pearl-jam-ties-alt-rock-record |title=Chart Moves: Ylvis' 'The Fox' Scampers Up Hot 100, Pearl Jam Ties Alt Rock Record, Luke Bryan Stays Atop Hot Country Songs |last=Trust |first=Gary |work=Billboard|date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the chart issue date December 14, 2013, the song reached a peak of number 36.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/charts/2013-12-14/the-billboard-hot-100|title=The Billboard Hot 100: Dec 14, 2013|work=Billboard|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song did better on other Billboard genre charts, such as the [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs]] and [[Pop Songs]] chart, where it reached number 9 and 12, respectively.&lt;ref name=r&amp;b/&gt;&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; In [[Canada]], the song only managed to reach number 28.&lt;ref name=canada/&gt; Elsewhere, the single didn't manage to even reach the top-forty, peaking at number 58 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], in [[Switzerland]] number 68&lt;ref name=swiss/&gt; and [[France]] 163.&lt;ref name=france/&gt;

==Music video==

A music video for the song, directed by Ryan Reichenfeld, was released on October 29, 2013.&lt;ref name=videostatic&gt;{{cite news|title=Justin Timberlake "TKO" (Ryan Reichenfeld, dir.)|url=http://www.videostatic.com/watch-it/2013/10/29/justin-timberlake-tko-ryan-reichenfeld-dir|accessdate=January 1, 2014|newspaper=[[Video Static]]|date=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timberlake's love interest in the video is played by [[Elvis Presley]]'s granddaughter [[Riley Keough]], with the video lasting for 7 minutes.&lt;ref name=billboardtkovideo&gt;{{cite news|title=Justin Timberlake's 'TKO' Video Is A Knock-Out: Watch|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5770653/justin-timberlakes-tko-video-is-a-knock-out-watch|accessdate=January 1, 2014|newspaper=[[Billboard Magazine]]|date=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was written by Timberlake and director Ryan Reichenfeld, and it splices scenes from a cushy loft—where Timberlake and Keough engage in various adult activities—and a not-too-distant future where the singer is roped behind a moving truck driven on a dusty road by his lady.&lt;ref name=billboardtkovideo/&gt; In another scene, Keough delivers a cast-iron skillet to Timberlake's cranium. Through it all, Timberlake keeps his chin up and continues to sing even while being dragged to his death.&lt;ref name=billboardtkovideo/&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyXtoTLLcDk |title=Justin Timberlake&amp;nbsp;— TKO |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=October 29, 2013 |accessdate=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video received positive reception from most critics. Carl Williot of ''[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]'' wrote that Timberlake "dropped another epic visual from '[[The 20/20 Experience]]' with 'TKO,' and while the subject matter couldn’t be further from that of his instant classic '[[Mirrors (Justin Timberlake song)|Mirrors]]' video, this one is just as sprawling and beautifully shot."&lt;ref name=idolatorvid&gt;{{cite news|last=Willot|first=Carl|title=Justin Timberlake’s "TKO" Video: Watch Him Get More Than Knocked Out|url=http://www.idolator.com/7490942/justin-timberlake-tko-video|accessdate=January 1, 2014|newspaper=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|date=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Billboard Magazine]]'' wrote that the video is "a knock-down, drag-out good time, with the singer getting into a bit of a mess with co-star Riley Keough in a slickly produced and thematic seven-minute clip."&lt;ref name=billboardtkovideo/&gt; Erika Harwood of ''[[The Michigan Daily]]'' called it "Disturbing and captivating, [...] another well crafted addition to the Timberlake canon."&lt;ref name=michigan&gt;{{cite news|last=Harwood|first=Erika|title=Music Video Review: 'TKO' theatrics typical for exceptional Timberlake|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/arts/10music-video-review-tko31|accessdate=January 1, 2014|newspaper=[[The Michigan Daily]]|date=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Melinda Newman of ''[[HitFix]]'' didn't like the violence on the video, writing that, "[...] this is a misguided look at domestic violence and there’s really no way you can make it work unless you take a much more obviously  cartoon-y look than they do here (they already pull all their punches- the sex is pretty antiseptic, no blood after the skillet hit, he almost seems to be enjoyed being dragged)  or you really commit and go all out (and run a link to a domestic violence hotline afterwards)."&lt;ref name=hitfixvideo&gt;{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Melinda|title=Justin Timberlake in 'TKO' revenge fantasy music video: Watch|url=http://www.hitfix.com/news/justin-timberlake-in-tko-revenge-fantasy-music-video-watch|accessdate=January 1, 2014|newspaper=[[HitFix]]|date=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
