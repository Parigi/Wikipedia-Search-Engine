The '''Grand Duchy of Tuscany''' ({{lang-it|Granducato di Toscana}}; {{lang-la|Magnus Ducatus Etruriae}}) was a central [[Italy|Italian]] [[monarchy]] that existed, with interruptions, from 1569 to 1859, replacing the [[Duchy of Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, Paul: ''The Medici: Godfathers of the Renaissance'', Vintage books, London, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-09-952297-3}}, pp. 315–321&lt;/ref&gt; The grand duchy's capital was [[Florence]]. In the 19th century the population of the Grand Duchy was about 1,815,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=commercio|first=Italia : Ministero di agricoltura, industria e|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_nwW6_HBLcTIC|title=Popolazione censimento degli antichi Stati sardi (1. gennaio 1858) e censimenti di Lombardia, di Parma e di Modena (1857-1858) pubblicati per cura del Ministero d'agricoltura, industria e commercio: Relazione generale con una introduzione storica sopra i censimenti delle popolazioni italiane dai tempi antichi sino all'anno 1860. 1.1|date=1862|publisher=Stamperia Reale|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Tuscany was ruled by the [[House of Medici]] until the extinction of its senior branch in 1737. While not as internationally renowned as the old republic, the grand duchy thrived under the Medici and it bore witness to unprecedented economic and military success under [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I]] and his sons, until the reign of [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando II]], which saw the beginning of the state's long economic decline. It peaked under [[Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it//enciclopedia/cosimo-iii-de-medici-granduca-di-toscana_(Dizionario-Biografico)|title=COSIMO III de' Medici, granduca di Toscana in "Dizionario Biografico"|website=www.treccani.it|language=it-IT|access-date=2020-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephen of Lorraine]], a cognatic descendant of the Medici, succeeded the family and ascended the throne of his Medicean ancestors. Tuscany was governed by a viceroy, [[Marc de Beauvau, Prince of Craon|Marc de Beauvau-Craon]], for his entire rule. His descendants ruled, and resided in, the grand duchy until its end in 1859, barring one interruption, when [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] gave Tuscany to the [[House of Bourbon-Parma]] ([[Kingdom of Etruria]], 1801–7). Following the collapse of the Napoleonic system in 1814, the grand duchy was restored. The [[United Provinces of Central Italy]], a client state of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], annexed Tuscany in 1859. Tuscany was formally annexed to Sardinia in 1860, as a part of the [[italian unification|unification of Italy]], following a landslide referendum, in which 95% of voters approved.&lt;ref name="Heraldica"/&gt;

==Medici Period==

===Foundation===
[[Image:Cosimo-GDuke-BR.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici]]]]&lt;!--KEEP THIS ON LEFT TO AVOID INTERFERENCE WITH INFOBOX--&gt;

In 1569, [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo de' Medici]] had ruled the [[Duchy of Florence]] for 32 years. During his reign, Florence purchased the island of [[Elba]] from the [[Republic of Genoa]] (in 1548),&lt;ref name="Strathern, p 340"/&gt; conquered [[Republic of Siena|Siena]] (in 1555)&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, p 335&lt;/ref&gt; and developed a well-equipped and powerful naval base on Elba. Cosimo also banned the clergy from holding administrative positions and promulgated laws of freedom of religion, which were unknown during his time.&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, p 375, 381.&lt;/ref&gt; Cosimo also was a long-term supporter of [[Pope Pius V]], who in the light of Florence's expansion in August 1569 declared Cosimo Grand Duke of Tuscany, a title unprecedented in Italy.&lt;ref name="Strathern, p 340"&gt;Strathern, p. 340&lt;/ref&gt;

The international reaction to Cosimo's elevation was bleak. [[Catherine de' Medici|Queen Catherine of France]], though herself a Medici, viewed Cosimo with the utmost disdain.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, Leonie: ''Catherine de' Medici'', Orion books, London, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7538-2039-0}}, pp. 268–269&lt;/ref&gt; Rumours circulated at the Viennese court that had Cosimo as a candidate for King of England.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Cecily: ''Cosimo I – Duke of Florence'', University Press, 1921 (pre-dates use of the ISBN), p 232&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and his cousin [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II of Spain]] reacted quite angrily, as Florence was an Imperial fief and declared Pius V's actions invalid. However, Maximilian eventually confirmed the elevation with an Imperial diploma in 1576.&lt;ref name=Hale145&gt;Hale, J.R.: ''Florence and the Medici'', Orion books, London, 1977, {{ISBN|1-84212-456-0}}, p 145&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]] of 1571, Cosimo fought against the [[Ottomans|Ottoman Empire]], siding with the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Holy League inflicted a crushing defeat against the Ottomans at the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]].&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, p. 271–272&lt;/ref&gt; Cosimo's reign was one of the most militaristic Tuscany had ever seen.

Cosimo experienced several personal tragedies during the later years of his reign. His wife, [[Eleanor of Toledo]], died in 1562, along with four of his children due to a plague epidemic in Florence. These deaths were to affect him greatly, which, along with illness, forced Cosimo to unofficially abdicate in 1564. This left his eldest son, [[Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Francesco]], to rule the duchy. Cosimo&amp;nbsp;I died in 1574 of [[apoplexy]], leaving a stable and extremely prosperous Tuscany behind him, having been the longest ruling Medici yet.&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, p. 340–341&lt;/ref&gt;

===Francesco and Ferdinando I===
{{See also|Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany}}
[[File:Ferdinando i de' medici 12.JPG|thumb|The Grand Duke Ferdinando I.]]
Francesco had little interest in governing his realm, instead participating in scientific experiments.&lt;ref name=Hale145/&gt; The administration of the state was delegated to bureaucrats. He continued his father's Austrian/Imperial alliance, cementing it by marrying [[Joanna of Austria, Grand Duchess of Tuscany|Johanna of Austria]].&lt;ref name="Hale, p 147"&gt;Hale, p 147&lt;/ref&gt; Francesco is best remembered for dying on the same day as his second wife, [[Bianca Cappello]], spurring rumours of poisoning.&lt;ref name="Hale, p 147"/&gt; He was succeeded by Ferdinando de' Medici, his younger brother, whom he loathed.&lt;ref name="Hale, p 147"/&gt;

Ferdinando eagerly assumed the government of Tuscany.&lt;ref name="Hale, p 151"&gt;Hale, p 151&lt;/ref&gt; He commanded the draining of the Tuscan marshlands, built a road network in Southern Tuscany, and cultivated trade in [[Livorno]].&lt;ref name=Hale151&gt;Hale, p 150&lt;/ref&gt; To augment the Tuscan silk industry, he oversaw the planting of [[Morus (plant)|Mulberry trees]] along the major roads (silk worms feed on Mulberry leaves).&lt;ref name="Hale, p 151"/&gt; He shifted Tuscany away from Habsburg&lt;ref&gt;Austria and Spain were ruled by the House of Habsburg; the two are interchangeable terms for the time period in question&lt;/ref&gt; hegemony by marrying the first non-Habsburg candidate since [[Alessandro de' Medici, Duke of Florence]], [[Christina of Lorraine]], a granddaughter of [[Catherine de' Medici]]. The Spanish reaction was to construct a citadel on their portion of the island of Elba.&lt;ref name=Hale151/&gt; To strengthen the new Tuscan alliance, he married the deceased Francesco's younger daughter, [[Marie de' Medici|Marie]], to [[Henry IV of France]]. Henry explicitly stated that he would defend Tuscany from Spanish aggression, but later reneged.&lt;ref name=Hale151/&gt; Ferdinando was forced to marry his heir, Cosimo, to [[Archduchess Maria Maddalena of Austria]] to assuage Spain (where Maria Maddalena's sister was the incumbent Queen consort).&lt;ref name=Hale151/&gt; Ferdinando sponsored a Tuscan [[Thornton expedition|colony in America]], with the intention of establishing a Tuscan settlement in the area of what is now [[French Guiana]]. Despite all of these incentives to economic growth and prosperity, the population of Florence, at dawn of the 17th century, was a mere 75,000 souls, far smaller than the other capitals of Italy: Rome, Milan, Venice, Palermo and Naples.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, p 158&lt;/ref&gt; Francesco and Ferdinando, due to lax distinction between Medici and Tuscan state property, are thought to be wealthier than their ancestor, [[Cosimo de' Medici]], the founder of the dynasty.&lt;ref name=Hale160&gt;Hale, p 160&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Duke alone had the prerogative to exploit the state's mineral and salt resources. The fortunes of the Medici were directly tied to the Tuscan economy.&lt;ref name=Hale160/&gt;

Ferdinando, despite no longer being a cardinal, exercised much influence at successive [[Papal conclave]]s; elections which chose the [[Pope]], the head of the [[Catholic Church]]. In 1605, Ferdinando succeeded in getting his candidate, Alessandro de' Medici, elected as [[Pope Leo XI]]. Leo XI died less than a month later, but fortunately for the Medici his successor [[Pope Paul V]] was also pro-Medici.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, p 165&lt;/ref&gt; Ferdinando's pro-Papal foreign policy, however, had drawbacks. Tuscany was overcome with religious orders, all of whom were not obliged to pay taxes. Ferdinando died in 1609, leaving an affluent realm; however, his inaction in international affairs drew Tuscany into the provincial yolk of politics.

===Cosimo II and Ferdinando II===
[[Image:Cosimo ii de' medici adn two.jpg|thumb|Maria Maddalena, Cosimo II and Ferdinando II, painting after [[Justus Sustermans]]]]
{{main|Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany}}
Ferdinando's elder son, Cosimo, mounted the throne following his death. Like his uncle, Francesco I, government held no appeal for him, and Tuscany was ruled by his ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, p 187&lt;/ref&gt; Cosimo II's twelve-year reign was punctuated by his contented marriage with Maria Maddalena and his patronage of astronomer [[Galileo Galilei]].

When Cosimo died, his oldest son, [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando]], was still a minor. This led to a regency of Ferdinand's grandmother, [[Christina of Lorraine|Dowager Grand Duchess Christina]], and his mother, Maria Maddalena of Austria. Christina heavily relied on priests as advisors, lifting Cosimo I's ban on clergy holding administrative roles in government, and promoted monasticism. Christina dominated her grandson long after he came of age until her death in 1636.&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, p. 375–37, 380–381.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother and grandmother arranged a marriage with [[Vittoria Della Rovere|Vittoria della Rovere]], a granddaughter of the [[Duchy of Urbino|Duke of Urbino]], in 1634. Together they had two children: [[Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo]], in 1642, and [[Francesco Maria de' Medici, Duke of Rovere and Montefeltro]], in 1660.&lt;ref&gt;Acton, p 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferdinando was obsessed with new technology, and had several [[hygrometer]]s, [[barometer]]s, [[thermometer]]s, and [[telescope]]s installed in the [[Palazzo Pitti|Pitti]].&lt;ref&gt;Acton, p 27&lt;/ref&gt; In 1657, [[Leopoldo de' Medici]], the Grand Duke's youngest brother, established the [[Accademia del Cimento]], which set up to attract scientists from all over Tuscany to Florence for mutual study.&lt;ref&gt;Acton, p 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuscany participated in the [[Wars of Castro]] (the last time Medicean Tuscany proper was involved in a conflict) and inflicted a defeat on the forces of [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] in 1643.&lt;ref name=Hale180&gt;Hale, p 180&lt;/ref&gt; The treasury was so empty that when the Castro mercenaries were paid for the state could no longer afford to pay interest on government bonds. The interest rate was lowered by 0.75%.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The economy was so decrepit that [[barter|barter trade]] became prevalent in rural market places.&lt;ref name=Hale180/&gt; The exchequer was barely adequate to cover the state's current expenditure, resulting in a complete termination of banking operations for the Medici.&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, p 381&lt;/ref&gt; Ferdinando II died in 1670, succeeded by his oldest surviving son Cosimo.&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosimo III===
[[Image:Cosimo III elderly.JPG|thumb|The Grand Duke Cosimo III in old age]]
[[Image:Giangastonecoronation.jpg|thumb|The Grand Duke Gian Gastone's coronation portrait; he was the last Medicean monarch of Tuscany]]
{{main|Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany}}
Cosimo III's reign was characterised by drastic changes and a sharp decline of the Grand Duchy. Cosimo III was of a puritan character, banning May celebrations, forcing prostitutes to pay for licenses and, beheading sodomites. He also instituted several laws censoring education&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced anti-Jewish legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Acton, p. 140–141.&lt;/ref&gt; He imposed crippling taxes&lt;ref&gt;Acton, p 185&lt;/ref&gt; while the country's population continued to decline. By 1705, the grand ducal treasury was virtually bankrupt, and the population of [[Florence]] had declined by approximately 50%, while the population of the entire grand duchy had decreased by an estimated 40%.&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, p 392&lt;/ref&gt; The once powerful navy was reduced to a pitiful state.&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, pp. 390–391.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosimo frequently paid the Holy Roman Emperor, his feudal overlord, high dues.&lt;ref&gt;Acton, p 243&lt;/ref&gt; He sent munitions to the Emperor during the [[Battle of Vienna]]. Tuscany was neutral during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], partly due to Tuscany's ramshackle military; a 1718 military review revealed that the army numbered less than 3,000 men, many of whom were infirm and elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Acton, pp. 272 – 273&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the state's capital, Florence, had become full of beggars.&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, p 400&lt;/ref&gt; Europe heard of the perils of Tuscany, and [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor]] asserted a remote claim to the grand duchy (through some Medici descent), but died before he could press the matter.

Cosimo married [[Marguerite Louise d'Orléans]], a granddaughter of [[Henry IV of France]] and Marie de' Medici. Their union wrought a high level of discontentment, but despite the tension they had three children, [[Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany|Ferdinando]], [[Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici|Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici, Electress Palatine]] and the last Medicean grand duke of Tuscany, [[Gian Gastone de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Gian Gastone de' Medici]]. Neither of Cosimo's two sons was a suitable heir; Ferdinando was an alcoholic and [[Epilepsy|epileptic]], while his younger son, Gian Gastone, according to historian [[Paul Strathern]], was not appropriate material{{clarify|date=April 2013}} for the role of sovereign.

Cosimo contemplated restoring the [[Republic of Florence]],&lt;ref name=Heraldica&gt;{{cite web | title=The Grand-Duchy of Tuscany | publisher=heraldica.org| date=July 4, 2005|author=François Velde|url=http://google.com/search?q=cache:kUU_EPqvxDoJ:www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/tuscany.htm+The+Grand-Duchy+of+Tuscany&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ie&amp;client=firefox-a | accessdate=2009-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Acton, p 254&lt;/ref&gt; a decision that was complicated by the Grand Duchy's feudal status: Florence was an Imperial fief, Siena a Spanish one.&lt;ref name=Heraldica/&gt; The plan was about to be approved by the powers convened at [[Geertruidenberg]] when Cosimo abruptly added that if himself and his two sons predeceased his daughter, the Electress Palatine, she should succeed and the republic be re-instituted following her death.&lt;ref&gt;Acton, p 255&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal sank, and ultimately died with Cosimo in 1723.

===The last years of the Medici===
Cosimo III  was succeeded by his son, [[Gian Gastone]], who, for most of his life, kept to his bed and acted in an unregal manner, rarely appearing to his subjects, to the extent that, at times, he had been thought dead. Gian Gastone would repeal his father's puritan laws.&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, pp. 402–405&lt;/ref&gt; In 1731, the Powers gathered at Vienna to decide who would succeed Gian Gastone. They drew up the [[Treaty of Vienna (1731)|Treaty of Vienna]], which gave the grand ducal throne to [[Charles III of Spain|Don Carlos, Duke of Parma]]. Gian Gastone was not as steadfast in negotiating Tuscany's future as his father was. He capitulated to foreign demands, and instead of endorsing the claim to the throne of his closest male relative, the [[Princes of Ottajano|prince of Ottajano]], he allowed Tuscany to be bestowed upon [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephen of Lorraine]]. Don Carlos became [[List of monarchs of Naples|King of Naples]] shortly after his arrival in Florence in 1735, by the [[Treaty of Turin (1733)|Treaty of Turin]]. Soon after, Francis Stephen of Lorraine became heir to the Tuscan throne. Gian Gastone had no say in events and had become quite attached to the Spanish Infante. The Tuscans despised the new occupying "Lorrainers", as they interfered with the Tuscan government, while the occupying Spaniards had not done so.&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, pp. 408–409&lt;/ref&gt; On July&amp;nbsp;9 1737, Gian Gastone died; the last male Medici of the Grand Ducal line.&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, p 410&lt;/ref&gt;

===Francis Stephen===
{{main|Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor}}
Francis I (as Francis Stephen became known) lived in Florence briefly with his wife, the [[Habsburg]] heiress [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], who became Tuscany's grand duchess. Francis had to cede his ancestral [[Lorraine (duchy)|Duchy of Lorraine]] in order to accommodate the deposed ruler of Poland, whose daughter [[Maria Leszczyńska|Marie Leszczyńska]] became Queen of France and of Navarre in 1725. Marie's father [[Stanisław Leszczyński|Stanisław I of Poland]] ruled Lorraine as compensation for his loss of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Kingdom of Poland]]. Francis was reluctant to resign the duchy, but [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]] (Maria Theresa's father) stated that if he didn't relinquish his rights to Lorraine, he could not marry Maria Theresa. Francis did not live in his Tuscan realm, and lived in the capital of his wife's realm, Vienna. He was elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1745. He died at [[Innsbruck]] from a stroke in 1765; his wife pledged the rest of her life to mourning him, while co-ruling with her son, and Francis' imperial successor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. Tuscany passed to another son, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold]].&lt;ref name=LeopoldI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/336666/Leopold-
 |title=Leopold II (holy Roman emperor) -- Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=2009-10-11|publisher=Britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administrative structure of the grand duchy itself would see little change under Francis&amp;nbsp;I.

===Reform===

[[File:Flag of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany (1840).svg|thumb|State flag of Tuscany (1765-1800, 1815–1848, 1849-1860)&lt;ref name="rbvex.it"&gt;[http://www.rbvex.it/toscana.html Bandiere degli Stati italiani preunitari: Toscana].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Map Kingdom of Etruria.jpg|thumb|The [[Kingdom of Etruria]], Tuscany's successor state during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]]]
Francis' second surviving son [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Peter Leopold]] became grand duke of Tuscany and ruled the country until his brother Joseph's death. He was unpopular among his subjects, though his many reforms brought the Grand Duchy to a level of stability that had not been seen in quite a while.&lt;ref name=LeopoldI/&gt;

Leopold developed and supported many social and economic reforms. He revamped the taxation and tariff system.&lt;ref name=LeopoldI/&gt; [[Smallpox]] vaccination was made systematically available (Leopold's mother Maria Theresa had been a huge supporter on [[inoculation]] against smallpox), and an early institution for the rehabilitation of [[Juvenile delinquency|juvenile delinquents]] was founded. Leopold also abolished [[capital punishment]]. On 30&amp;nbsp;November 1786, after having de&amp;nbsp;facto blocked capital executions (the last was in 1769), Leopold promulgated the reform of the penal code that abolished the death penalty and ordered the destruction of all the instruments for capital execution in his land. [[Torture]] was also banned.&lt;ref name=Leopoldedict&gt;[[Humphry William Woolrych|Woolrych, Humphry William]]: ''The history and results of the present capital punishments in England; to which are added, full tables of convictions, executions, etc'', Saunders and Benning, 1832, (pre-dates use of the ISBN), p 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Leopold also introduced radical reforms to the system of neglect and inhumane treatment of the [[Mental disorder|mentally ill]]. On 23&amp;nbsp;January 1774, the ''legge sui pazzi'' (law regarding the insane) was established, the first of its kind to be introduced in Europe, allowing steps to be taken to hospitalize individuals deemed insane. A few years later Leopold undertook the project of building a new hospital, the Bonifacio. He used his skill at choosing collaborators to put a young physician, Vincenzo Chiarugi, at its head. Chiarugi and his collaborators introduced new humanitarian regulations in the running of the hospital and caring for the mentally ill patients, including banning the use of chains and physical punishment, and in so doing have been recognized as early pioneers of what later came to be known as the moral treatment movement.&lt;ref&gt;Mora, G. (1959) Vincenzo Chiarugi (1759–1820) and his psychiatric reform in Florence in the late 18th century (on the occasion of the bi-centenary of his birth) ''J Hist Med.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Leopold attempted to secularize the property of the religious houses or to put the clergy entirely under the control of the government. These measures, which disturbed the deeply rooted convictions of his people and brought him into collision with the pope, were not successful.

Leopold also approved and collaborated on the development of a political constitution, said to have anticipated by many years the promulgation of the French constitution and which presented some similarities with the [[Virginia Bill of Rights]] of 1778. Leopold's concept of this was based on respect for the political rights of citizens and on a harmony of power between the executive and the legislative. However, the constitution was so radically new that it garnered opposition even from those who might have benefited from it. In 1790, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] died without issue and Leopold was called to Vienna, to assume the rule of his family's [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian dominions]] and become Emperor.&lt;ref name=Leopoldedict/&gt; His second son Ferdinand became ruler of the Grand Duchy. Leopold himself died in 1792.

===Tuscany during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars===
{{main|Kingdom of Etruria}}
Leopold was succeeded by [[Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinand III]]. Ferdinand was the son of the incumbent Grand Duke, and [[Maria Luisa of Spain|Grand Duchess Maria Louisa]]. He was forced out by the French during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], first in 1799, and then after the [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1801)]], becoming instead [[Elector of Salzburg]], ruling the territory of the former archbishopric. The Grand Duchy was then dissolved, and replaced by the [[Kingdom of Etruria]] under the house of [[Bourbon-Parma]], in compensation for their loss of [[Duchy of Parma]]. In 1803, the first King of Etruria, [[Louis I of Etruria|Louis I]], died and was succeeded by his infant son, [[Charles II, Duke of Parma|Charles Louis]], under the regency of his mother, Queen [[Maria Luisa of Spain, Duchess of Lucca|María Luisa]].

Etruria lasted less than a decade. By the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1807)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] (27 October 1807), Etruria was to be annexed by France. The negotiations had been between Spain and France, and the Etrurian regent was kept entirely in the dark, only being informed that she would have to leave her young son's kingdom on 23 November 1807. She and her court left on 10 December. On 30 May 1808, Etruria was formally annexed to France. An "Extraordinary Giunta" was placed in charge under General [[Jacques François Menou]]. Tuscany was divided into the ''[[département]]s'' of [[Arno (département)|Arno]], [[Méditerranée]] and [[Ombrone (département)|Ombrone]]. In March 1809 a "General Government of the Departments of Tuscany" was set up, and [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] put his sister [[Elisa Bonaparte]] at its head, with the title of Grand Duchess of Tuscany.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson-Laufer, Guida Myrl:''Women Rulers Throughout the Ages: An Illustrated Guide'', ABC-CLIO, 1999, {{ISBN|978-1-57607-091-8}}, p 142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[H. A. L. Fisher]], "The French Dependencies and Switzerland", in A. Ward ''et al.'' (eds.), ''Cambridge Modern History, IX: Napoleon'' (Cambridge, 1934), p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tuscany restored and its final demise===
[[File:Leopold II of Tuscany.jpg|thumb|[[Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] (r. 1824–1859) in the uniform of an Austrian Field Marshal, 1828, after [[Pietro Benvenuti]]]]
The Napoleonic system collapsed in 1814, and the following territorial settlement, the [[Congress of Vienna]], ceded the [[State of Presidi]] to a restored Tuscany. Ferdinand III resumed his rule, and died in 1824. [[Italian nationalism]] exploded in the post-Napoleonic years, leading to the establishment of secret societies bent on a unified Italy. Whence these leagues arrived in Tuscany, a concerned Ferdinand requisitioned an Austrian garrison, from his brother [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Francis of Austria]], for the defence of the state. Ferdinand aligned Tuscany with Austria.&lt;ref name="CATHOLIC ENCY."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15103b.htm|author=Catholic Encyclopaedia|accessdate=18 October 2009|title=Tuscany|publisher=newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mappa del Granducato di Toscana nel 1815.png|thumb|300px|left|Map of Grand Duchy of Tuscany in 1815]]
Following Ferdinand's death, his elder son, [[Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Leopold II]], succeeded him. Leopold was contemporarily acknowledged as a liberal monarch.&lt;ref name="CATHOLIC ENCY."/&gt; Despite his merits, his subjects dismissed him as a foreigner. His affinity for Austria was equally unpalatable. In 1847, Leopold, following the death of the then-incumbent Duchess of Parma, [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie Louise of Austria]], annexed the [[Duchy of Lucca]]. (A state created solely to accommodate the [[House of Bourbon|House of Bourbon-Parma]] until they could re-assume their Parmese sovereignty). The same year, a Tuscan state council was brought into being.

In Leopold's years Italy was engulfed in popular rebellion, culminating in the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. The said revolution toppled the throne of France, and caused disarray across Europe. In Tuscany, Leopold II sanctioned a liberal constitution; and instituted a liberal ministry. Despite his attempts at acquiescence, street fighting in opposition to the regime sprang up in August, in Livorno. Leopold II lent his support to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states#The 1848 war with Austria|Austro-Sardinian War]]. In February 1849, Leopold II had to abandon Tuscany to Republicans and sought refuge in the Neapolitan city of [[Gaeta]]. A provisional republic was established in his stead. It was only with Austrian assistance that Leopold could return to Florence. The constitution was revoked in 1852.&lt;ref name="CATHOLIC ENCY."/&gt; The Austrian garrison was withdrawn in 1855.

The [[Second Italian War of Independence|Second Austro-Sardinian war]] broke out in the summer of 1859. Leopold felt obliged to espouse Austria's cause.&lt;ref name=BrittanicaLeopold&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/336677/Leopold-II|title=Leopold II (grand duke of Tuscany) -- Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate= 26 September 2009|publisher=Britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia]] captured Tuscany in its entirety, and held it for the duration of the conflict; Leopold fled Tuscany as a result. [[Armistice of Villafranca#The peace|The Peace of Villafranca]] allowed Leopold to return once more. Upon arrival, he abdicated in favour of his elder son, [[Ferdinand IV of Tuscany|Ferdinand]]. Ferdinand IV's hypothetical reign didn't last long; the [[House of Habsburg|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] was formally deposed by the National Assembly on 16 August 1859.&lt;ref name="CATHOLIC ENCY."/&gt;

In December 1859, the Grand Duchy was joined to the Duchies of [[Duchy of Modena|Modena]] and [[Duchy of Parma|Parma]] to form the [[United Provinces of Central Italy]], which were annexed by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] a few months later. On 22 March 1860, after a referendum  that voted overwhelmingly (95%&lt;ref name=Heraldica/&gt;) in favour of a union with Sardinia; Tuscany was formally annexed to Sardinia.&lt;ref name=Heraldica/&gt; Italy was unified in 1870, when the remains of the Papal States were annexed in that September, deposing [[Pope Pius IX]].

==Government==
Tuscany was divided into two main administrative districts: the ''stato nuovo'' (the new state) consisting of the former [[Republic of Siena]], and the ''stato vecchio'' (the old state), the old Republic of Florence and her dependencies. The two areas were governed by separate laws. They were divided because the ''stato nuovo'' was a Spanish [[fief]] and the ''stato vecchio'' an [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] one. Siena was ruled by a governor appointed by the grand duke. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] proclaimed Alessandro de' Medici, ruler of Florence "for his lifetime, and after his death to be succeeded by his sons, male heirs and successors, of his body, by order of primogeniture, and failing them by the closest male of the Medici family, and likewise in succession forever, by order of primogeniture."&lt;ref name=Heraldica/&gt;

Following the Republic's surrender in the [[Siege of Florence (1529–1530)|Siege of Florence]], Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor issued a proclamation explicitly stating that he and he alone could determine the government of Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, p 118&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 August 1530, the Emperor created the Medici hereditary rulers (''capo'') of the ''Republic'' of Florence.&lt;ref name=Hale119&gt;Hale, 119&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Clement VII]] willed his relative [[Alessandro de' Medici]] to be the monarchical ruler of Florence, and went about requisitioning that dignity carefully; he wanted to give the impression that the Florentines democratically chose Alessandro to be their monarch.&lt;ref name=Hale119/&gt; In April 1532, the Pope convinced the ''Balía'', Florence's ruling commission, to draw up a new constitution. The document in question was officiated on the 27th of that month. It formally created a hereditary monarchy, abolished the age-old ''signoria'' (elective government) and the office of ''[[gonfaloniere]]'' (titular ruler of Florence elected for a two-month term); in their place was the ''consigliere'', a  four-man council elected for a three-month term, headed by the "Duke of the Florentine Republic" (and later the Grand Duke of Tuscany). The Senate, composed of forty-eight men, chosen by the constitutional reform commission, was vested with the prerogative of determining Florence's financial, security, and foreign policies. Additionally, the senate appointed the commissions of war and public security, and the governors of Pisa, Arezzo, Prato, Voltera and Cortona and ambassadors.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, p 121&lt;/ref&gt; To be eligible, one had to be male and a noble.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, p 153&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Two Hundred was a petitions court; membership was for life. This constitution was still in effect through the Medicean grand duchy, albeit the institutions decayed and powerless by the rule of [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando II]].&lt;ref&gt;Hale, p 178&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the Medici acquired several territories, which included: the County of [[Pitigliano]], purchased from the [[Orsini family]] in 1604; the [[County of Santa Fiora]], acquired from the [[Sforza|House of Sforza]] in 1633; Spain ceded [[Pontremoli]] in 1650, Silvia Piccolomini sold her estates, the [[Marquisate of Castiglione]] at the time of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I]], [[Pietrasanta|Lordship of Pietra Santa]], and the Duchy of [[Capistrano (VV)|Capistrano]] and the city of [[Penna San Giovanni|Penna]] in the [[Kingdom of Naples]].&lt;ref name=Heraldica/&gt; [[Vittoria della Rovere]] brought the Duchies of Montefeltro and Rovere into the family in 1631, upon her death in 1694, they passed to her younger son, [[Francesco Maria de' Medici, Duke of Rovere and Montefeltro|Francesco Maria de' Medici]]. They reverted to the crown with the ascension of Gian Gastone.&lt;ref&gt;Acton, pp. 207–208&lt;/ref&gt;

Gian Gastone, the last Medici, resigned the grand duchy to Francis Stephen of Lorraine. Under him, Tuscany was ruled by a [[viceroy]], [[Marc de Beauvau-Craon (1679-1754)|Marc de Beauvau-Craon, Prince de Craon]]. Francis Stephen altered the laws of succession in 1763, when he declared his second son, Leopold, heir to the grand duchy. If Leopold's line were to become extinct, it would revert to the main line. Every grand duke after Leopold resided in Florence. The grand duke Leopold II agreed to ratify a liberal constitution in 1848. The grand duke was briefly deposed by a provisional government in 1849. He was restored the same year by Austrian troops. The government was finally dissolved upon its annexation to the United Provinces of Central Italy in 1859.&lt;ref name=Heraldica/&gt;
