'''Apple Pay''' is a [[mobile payment]] and [[digital wallet]] service by [[Apple Inc.]] that allows users to make [[payment]]s in person, in [[App Store (iOS)|iOS apps]], and on the web. It is supported on the [[iPhone]], [[Apple Watch]], [[iPad]], and [[Macintosh|Mac]]. It digitizes and can replace a [[credit card|credit]] or [[debit card|debit]] card [[chip and PIN]] transaction at a contactless-capable [[point-of-sale terminal]]. Apple Pay does not require Apple Pay-specific [[contactless payment]] terminals; it works with any merchant that accepts contactless payments.&lt;ref name="pocket-lint.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207957|title=Countries and regions that support Apple Pay|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|date=July 17, 2019|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to contactless payments, with the addition of [[two-factor authentication]] via Touch ID, [[Face ID]], PIN, or passcode. Devices wirelessly communicate with point of sale systems using [[near field communication]] (NFC), with an embedded secure element (eSE) to securely store payment data and perform cryptographic functions, and Apple's [[Touch ID]] and [[Face ID]] for biometric authentication.

Originally launching in the United States, Apple Pay is available in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[China]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]], [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Belarus]], [[Montenegro]] and all countries in the [[European Economic Area|European Economic Area (EEA)]].&lt;ref name="pocket-lint.com" /&gt; Apple Pay supports both international payment schemes—such as [[American Express]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] (including [[Visa Electron|Electron]] and [[V Pay]]), [[Mastercard]] (including [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]]), and [[Discover Card|Discover]]—as well as country-specific domestic payment schemes like China's [[UnionPay]], Japan's [[JCB Co., Ltd.|JCB]], France's [[Groupement des Cartes Bancaires CB|Cartes Bancaires]], Australia's [[eftpos]] and Saudi Arabia's [[Saudi Payments Network|mada]]. Participating banks vary by region. Apple Pay can also be used to ride some public transport networks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207958|title=Where you can ride transit with Apple Pay|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] Support|access-date=2019-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; either through the use of credit/debit cards (open loop) or dedicated travel cards such as [[JR East]]'s [[Suica]] or the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]]'s [[OMNY]] (closed loop).

==Service==
===Device compatibility===
The service is compatible with [[iPhone 6]] and newer, [[iPad Air 2]] and newer, Macs with Touch ID, and all [[Apple Watch|Apple Watches]]. Users with the [[iPhone 5]] and [[iPhone 5C]] can use the service through an Apple Watch, though it lacks Touch ID security. (The iPhone 5s has Touch ID but not NFC; iPhone 5s users must use an Apple Watch and confirm using Touch ID on the iPhone 5s.)&lt;ref name="The Verge: allows you"/&gt; Instead, Apple Pay is activated with a passcode and remains active for as long as the user wears the Apple Watch.&lt;ref name="COM AW theft 1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cultofmac.com/295024/apple-watch-anti-theft|title=Clever trick will safeguard Apple Watch from thieves |publisher= Cult Of Mac |date= September 10, 2014 |accessdate= November 10, 2014 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can store eight or 12 cards depending upon the device.&lt;ref name="Set up Apple Pay"&gt;{{cite web |title= Set up Apple Pay |url= https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht204506 |publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] |accessdate=June 4, 2018 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
Apple Pay uses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = How Apple Pay Really Works and Why You Should Begin Using it Immediately | url = http://www.kirklennon.com/a/applepay.html | date = 2014-10-20 | first = kirk | last = Lennon |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the EMV Payment Tokenisation Specification.&lt;ref name="emvpaytok"&gt;{{cite web | title =  Payment Tokenisation | url = http://www.emvco.com/specifications.aspx?id=263 | publisher = EMVco | date = 2014-03-01 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The service keeps customer payment information private from the retailer by replacing the customer's credit or debit card [[Primary Account Number|Funding Primary Account Number]] (FPAN) with a tokenized Device Primary Account Number (DPAN), and creates a "dynamic security code [...] generated for each transaction".&lt;ref name="The Verge: allows you"/&gt; The 'dynamic security code' is the cryptogram in an [[EMV]]-mode transaction, and the Dynamic Card Verification Value (dCVV) in a magnetic stripe data emulation-mode transaction. Apple added that they would not track usage, which would stay between the customers, the vendors, and the banks. Users can also remotely halt the service on a lost phone via the [[Find My iPhone]] service.&lt;ref name="The Verge: allows you"/&gt;

To pay at points of sale, users hold their authenticated Apple device to the point of sale system's NFC card reader. iPhone users authenticate by using Touch ID, Face ID,&lt;ref name="The Verge: allows you"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Apple Pay security"&gt;{{cite web | title=Apple Pay security and privacy overview | publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] | date=July 12, 2019 | url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203027 | access-date=August 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; or passcode,&lt;ref name="Apple Pay security" /&gt; whereas [[Apple Watch]] users authenticate by double clicking a button on the device.&lt;ref name="The Verge: watch works"/&gt; To pay in supported iOS apps, users choose Apple Pay as their payment method and authenticate with Touch ID or Face ID.&lt;ref name="The Verge: allows you"/&gt; Users can add payment cards to the service in any of four ways: through the payment card listed on their iTunes accounts, by taking a photo of the card, being provisioned from within the card issuer's app, or by entering the card information manually.

Although users receive immediate notification of the transaction, the Apple Pay system is not an [[instant payment]] instrument, because the funds transfer between counter-parties is not immediate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/retpaym/instant/html/index.en.html |title= Definition of instant payment system |publisher=[[European Central Bank]] |date=February 24, 2018 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement time depends on the payment method chosen by the customer. (An exception being payments made using a Japanese [[Suica]] card, which stores the user's balance on the card itself and can transfer funds directly to the merchant without the need for an online connection.)

In the [[United Kingdom]], traditional contactless payments using bank cards are limited to £45 (previously £30 until April 2020 and then previously £20 until August 2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Titcomb |first= James |title= Most Apple Pay UK transactions will be limited to £20, for now |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/11696699/Most-Apple-Pay-UK-transactions-will-be-limited-to-20-for-now.html |accessdate= July 13, 2015 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date= June 24, 2015 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as no cardholder authentication is provided as part of the transaction. Payments using Apple Pay, however, support payments of any amount owing to the increased security and lower risk of fraud in Apple Pay transactions (although some issuing banks may impose their own transaction limits, and not all contactless readers support this functionality – see CDCVM below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204906|title=About Apple Pay for merchants in the UK |publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] |accessdate= July 12, 2015 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar transaction limits apply in other countries.

Apple assumes some liability for fraudulent use of the service.&lt;ref name="The Verge: allows you" /&gt; Banks are expected to carry the burden of the service, and Apple is said to have negotiated smaller transaction fees. In turn, the banks hoped to capture purchases that were formerly handled without credit.&lt;ref name="NYT: Apple's Way" /&gt; ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported that Apple receives 0.15% cut of US purchases made with the service,&lt;ref name="The Register: 0.15%" /&gt; but, following the UK launch, reported that Apple's cut is much lower in the UK. This is largely because Regulation (EU) 2015/751 capped [[interchange fees]] in the [[European Economic Area]] at 0.3% for personal credit cards and 0.2% for personal debit cards with effect from June 8, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Arnold |first= Martin |title= UK banks put squeeze on Apple Pay fees |url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/02287f44-2a3d-11e5-8613-e7aedbb7bdb7.html |work=[[Financial Times]] |date= July 14, 2015 |accessdate= July 15, 2015 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Regulation (EU) 2015/751 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 29, 2015 on interchange fees for card-based payment transactions |url= http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2015.123.01.0001.01.ENG |publisher= [[European Commission]] |accessdate= July 25, 2015 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, Apple receives 0.05% for debit cards and 0.12% for credit cards of each purchase, in addition, the bank pays 45 rubles a year for each card added in the service.&lt;ref name="Ведомости: комиссия"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.vedomosti.ru/finance/articles/2016/10/07/659962-apple-pay-komissiyu |title= Apple Pay берет с банков небольшую комиссию за каждую транзакцию |date= 2016-10-07 |publisher= Ведомости | language=Russian |accessdate= 2016-12-06 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|CDCVM}}Consumer Device Cardholder Verification Method (CDCVM) ===
In EMV-mode transactions, Apple Pay supports the use of the Consumer Device Cardholder Verification Method (CDCVM) using Touch ID, Face ID or the phone's or watch's passcode. The use of CDCVM allows for the device itself to provide verification for the transaction and may not require the cardholder to sign a receipt or enter their PIN. Additionally, in certain markets which have a 'no verification contactless limit' using contactless cards (such as the £30 limit in the United Kingdom and the C$100 limit in Canada), the use of CDCVM can enable merchants to accept transactions higher than these amounts using Apple Pay, providing their terminal software is updated to support the latest network contactless specifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202527 |title= Consumer Device Cardholder Verification Method |publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] |access-date= 2016-12-01 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Express Transit or Express Travel ===
Since iOS 12.3, supported credit and debit cards, as well as some [[stored-value card|stored-value transport cards]] (such as Shanghai &amp; Beijing transit cards, [[Suica]], [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] and [[TriMet]]) can be used to pay for journeys on certain public transport networks without requiring the user to authenticate the payment with [[Touch ID]] or [[Face ID]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209495|title=Use Express Transit with Apple Pay|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] Support|access-date=2019-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a supported credit, debit or transit card is selected as a user's Express Transit/Travel card, the user can simply hold their device near the card reader, for example at ticket barriers, to initiate or complete payment for the journey.

Within iOS, the functionality is labelled as "Express Transit" in North America and "Express Travel" in most other English-speaking countries, because "transit" in most varieties of English has a narrower meaning of travelling through a jurisdiction or airport during a journey as opposed to travel or transport in general.

On iPhone XR, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and later, Express Transit/Travel cards can be used up to five hours on Power Reserve after the device has powered off due to a drained battery. The typical low-battery icon will display with "Express Cards Available" text appearing at the bottom of the display, letting users know that Express Transit/Travel is still available for usage.

Express mode is also available for contactless student ID cards stored in the Wallet app.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208965|title=Use student ID cards in Wallet on your iPhone or Apple Watch|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] Support|access-date=2019-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global acceptance ===
About two-thirds of merchants accept Apple Pay, but many terminals don’t.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple Card Review: Actually Owning It Changed Our Minds|url=https://thewirecutter.com/money/credit-cards/apple-credit-card-review/|last=Tepper|first=Taylor|date=11 May 2020|website=Wirecutter|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to [[provisioning]] differences between countries (and even between issuers), users may encounter acceptance issues when travelling to a different country. Some known issues include:
* Canada, UK, and possibly other non-US-issued VISA cards only support EMV-mode transactions and not legacy magnetic stripe data emulation transactions. Some contactless terminals in the US do not support EMV-mode contactless transactions (even if they support EMV contact transactions), and therefore these visitors to the US will receive a 'Could Not Complete Payment' error on the iPhone screen and an error on the terminal when attempting to use Apple Pay.

=== Apple Cash ===
'''Apple Cash''', formerly '''Apple Pay Cash''', is a feature that allows the transfer of money from one user to another via [[iMessage]]. When a user receives a payment, the funds are deposited in the recipient's Apple Cash card, where it is available for immediate use at merchants that accept Discover. Alternatively, the user can choose to transfer the balance to a nominated bank account via [[ACH Network|ACH transfer]]. Apple Cash is only available in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.macworld.com/article/3236545/ios/apple-pay-cash-guide-what-it-is-how-it-works-and-what-it-costs.html |title= Apple Pay Cash guide: What it is, how it works, and what it costs |work=[[Macworld]] |access-date= 2018-08-05 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2017/12/19/how-to-use-apple-pay-cash/ |title= How To Use Apple Pay Cash |last= Chowdhry |first= Amit |work=[[Forbes]] |access-date= 2018-08-05 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== 2013 ===
The service was in preparation for "a long time", as Apple acquired startups, hired executives and filed patents related to payments.&lt;ref name="The Verge: allows you" /&gt; Apple partnered with American Express, [[MasterCard]] and Visa. Their joint project began in January 2013, though they had discussed Apple's potential involvement for years. Their joint solution was a system where single-use digital tokens would replace the transfer of personal information.&lt;ref name="NYT: Apple's Way" /&gt; A Visa executive said that 750 people at the company worked on the anonymized "token" system for a year, and the other partners had similar teams in collaboration.&lt;ref name="The Verge: most revolutionary" /&gt; MasterCard began work on the project in 2013 and hoped that their joint work would become a "standard for mobile payments".&lt;ref name="The Verge: most revolutionary" /&gt; The announcement of the service came at a time when MasterCard and Visa policy created strong incentives for upgrading to mobile payment-compatible point of sale systems.&lt;ref name="The Verge: allows you" /&gt; Apple then approached several big banks in mid 2013 and did not divulge the names of the other banks. To maintain secrecy, JPMorgan set up a windowless "war room" where the majority of the sensitive work was done. Of their 300 people on the project, about 100 knew that the partner was Apple. Others close to the project did not know it was named "Apple Pay" until the announcement. The company's participation remained a secret leading up to its announcement.&lt;ref name="NYT: Apple's Way" /&gt;

=== 2014 ===
The service was announced at Apple's iPhone 6 event on September 9, 2014. At its announcement, Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]] described the magnetic stripe card payment process as broken for its reliance on plastic cards' "outdated and vulnerable magnetic interface", "exposed numbers", and insecure "security codes".&lt;ref name="The Verge: allows you" /&gt; The [[iOS 8]].1 software update accompanying the service's launch activated Apple Pay on compatible devices.&lt;ref name="The Verge: allows you" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Verge: watch works" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= How To Set Up Apple Pay On Your iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch| work= TaletLeopard |url= http://talentleopard.com/how-to-set-up-apple-pay-on-iphone-or-ipad/ |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company announced an API for app developers to build Apple Pay checkout into their apps.&lt;ref name="The Verge: allows you" /&gt;

==Reception==
===Reviews===
Journalists noted the multiple previously unsuccessful efforts of other retailers to build mobile payments services,&lt;ref name="The Verge: allows you"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Verge: most revolutionary"/&gt; including those of [[PayPal]], [[Walmart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]],&lt;ref name="The Verge: allows you"/&gt; [[Google Wallet]], and [[Softcard]].&lt;ref name="The Verge: most revolutionary"/&gt; They noted that previous efforts did not solve customer inconvenience issues, and felt that Apple Pay potentially did.&lt;ref name="The Verge: allows you"/&gt; ''[[The Verge]]''{{'s}} Adrianne Jeffries noted that mobile payment market fragmentation was partially due to Apple's refusal to enter the market. [[Bloomberg Businessweek|''BusinessWeek'']]'s Joshua Brustein added that Apple has a history of letting "first movers fail" with an early version of the service before releasing "a more polished version of the same idea".&lt;ref name="The Verge: allows you"/&gt; ''The Verge''{{'s}} Dieter Bohn called Apple Pay the "week's most revolutionary product" and the announcement "a classic Apple moment of simplification and integration", and the partnership between payments services and Apple "a rare piece of collaboration and agreement". He predicted that the service's effect on the mobile payments industry would be similar to the [[iPhone]]'s effect on the [[smartphone]] industry.&lt;ref name="The Verge: most revolutionary"/&gt; Nathaniel Popper of ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to the banks' level of coordination with Apple as "elaborate" and indicative of mutual "preparation and investment".&lt;ref name="NYT: Apple's Way"/&gt; Some analysts added that the service could reduce the standard credit card transaction fees over time, since fees traditionally cover [[credit card fraud]]. The banks were willing to work with Apple in the face of efforts like [[Bitcoin]] and the [[Merchant Customer Exchange]], which seeks to work around the card networks.&lt;ref name="NYT: Apple's Way"/&gt;

Early reviews of the service regarded it as easy to use, but were not sure whether the service would become widely adopted.&lt;ref name="The Verge: hands"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT: problem"/&gt; ''The Verge''{{'s}} [[Nilay Patel]] wrote that the product demo was "remarkably smooth" and "a cohesive user experience".&lt;ref name="The Verge: hands"/&gt; Patel said the process took five to ten seconds at a retail card reader, and added that it may be less smooth at stores such as Walgreens, where cashiers prompt customers for loyalty cards and charity donations.&lt;ref name="The Verge: hands"/&gt; ''The New York Times''{{'}} Neil Irwin wrote that Apple exaggerated the inconvenience of credit cards. Among the plastic card's benefits, he included how others could make purchases on another's behalf and how dead cell phones could leave the owner stranded.&lt;ref name="NYT: problem"/&gt;

In a 2018 publication released by ''[[Consumer Reports]]'', Apple Pay was the leading payment service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fingas |first=Jon |date=August 6, 2018 |title=Apple Pay Cash leads Consumer Reports' first payment service test |url=https://www.engadget.com/amp/2018/08/06/consumer-reports-p2p-payment-service-test/ |publisher=[[Engadget]] |accessdate=2018-08-07 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, Apple faced opposition by the mobile payments industry, particularly the [[Merchant Customer Exchange]] (MCX) which was trialing a competing system known as [[CurrentC]]. Several participants of CurrentC, such as [[Best Buy]], [[Walmart]], and [[Publix]] had initially stated that they would not accept Apple Pay as a result of exclusivity deals. [[CVS Pharmacy]] and [[Rite-Aid]] subsequently disabled all NFC payment systems in favor of CurrentC,&lt;ref name="NYT: Apple's Way"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/banks-did-it-apples-way-in-payments-by-mobile |title= Banks Did It Apple's Way in Payments by Mobile |work= [[The New York Times]] |first= Nathaniel |last= Popper |date= September 11, 2014 |archiveurl= https://archive.today/20140915052657/http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/banks-did-it-apples-way-in-payments-by-mobile/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=2 |archivedate= September 15, 2014 |url-status = live|df= mdy-all |access-date= March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techcrunch-currentc"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/25/currentc |title= CurrentC Is The Big Retailers' Clunky Attempt To Kill Apple Pay And Credit Card Fees |work=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL Inc.]] |first= Josh |last= Constine |date= October 25, 2014 |accessdate= October 26, 2014 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-cvsriteaid"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/10/apple-pay-goes-offline-at-cvs-rite-aid |title= Apple Pay goes offline at CVS, Rite Aid |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date= October 30, 2014 |accessdate= October 30, 2014 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; although due to the exclusivity period ending in August 2015, Rite Aid has begun accepting it August 15, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.macrumors.com/2015/08/11/rite-aid-apple-pay-august-15/ |title= Rite Aid Reverses Course, Will Accept Apple Pay Starting August 15 |publisher=[[MacRumors]] |date= August 11, 2015 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/08/11/rite-aid-apple-pay/31455651/ |title= Rite Aid to accept Apple Pay after initial refusal |work=[[USA Today]] |date=August 11, 2015 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Best Buy]] has begun to accept Apple Pay at all stores starting in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macrumors.com/2015/09/17/best-buy-apple-pay-rolling-out/ |title=Best Buy Rolling Out In-Store Apple Pay Support in U.S. |publisher=[[MacRumors]] |date=September 17, 2015 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Target Corporation|Target's]] CEO [[Brian Cornell]] said that they would be open to accepting Apple Pay eventually after the conversion to chip and PIN technology is done, but they remain involved with MCX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://recode.net/2015/05/27/target-ceo-loves-apple-pay-but-wants-chip-and-pin-cards-first/|website=re/code|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104151100/http://recode.net/2015/05/27/target-ceo-loves-apple-pay-but-wants-chip-and-pin-cards-first/ |archive-date=January 4, 2016 |title=Target CEO Loves Apple Pay, but Wants Chip-and-PIN Cards First (Video)|author=Arik Hesseldahl|date=May 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 22, 2019, Target announced the roll-out of Apple Pay support to all of its US stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/22/18192802/apple-pay-target-iphone-watch |date=January 22, 2019 |author=Makena Kelly |publisher=The Verge |title=Target is adding Apple Pay and Google Pay to all US stores}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2016, according to ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', Apple said its mobile payment platform is gaining a million new users each week, yet the company did not reveal the total number of Apple Pay users. Apple also revealed that transaction volume through the service is five times what it was a year ago, and that payment volume within apps more than doubled in the second half of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/02/grubhub-apple-pay/|title=Grubhub Adds Apple Pay To Food Delivery Apps |date= 2016-06-02|website=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|access-date=2016-06-03 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the launch of Apple Pay in China, the service hit three million provisions inside its first three days, while, more generally, it is adding one million new users per week worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/17/apple-pay-goes-live-in-china/|title=Apple Pay Goes Live In China|last=Russell|first=Jon|website=[[TechCrunch]]|access-date=2016-07-08 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
