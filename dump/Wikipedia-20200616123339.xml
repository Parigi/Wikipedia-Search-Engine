'''Joanna Karine Hoffman''' (born July 27, 1953)&lt;ref&gt;[https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:K1S9-HCT Joanna Hoffman public record] accessed 11-7-2015&lt;/ref&gt; is an American marketing executive. She was one of the original members of both the [[Apple Computer]] [[Macintosh]] team and the [[NeXT]] team.&lt;ref name="iswa"&gt;{{cite book |last=Isaacson |first=Walter |date= |title=[[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]] |url= |location= |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |page=ebook |isbn= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=out&gt;{{cite web

==Early life and education==
Hoffman was born in Poland, the daughter of film director [[Jerzy Hoffman]] and his Armenian former wife Marlena Nazarian. She lived with her mother in the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenian SSR]] until age 10, when she went to live with her father in [[Warsaw]], Poland. In 1967, her mother married an American and moved to [[Buffalo, New York]]. Hoffman joined them in the United States in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://on.aol.com/video/megan-smith-joanna-hoffman-the-2016-makers-conference-519466581 Joanna Hoffman Interview at Makers Conference 2016] accessed 2-7-2015&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffman quickly became fluent in English and excelled in school.

She has a background in anthropology, physics, and linguistics,&lt;ref name=machis/&gt; a Bachelor of Science in Humanities and Science from [[MIT]], and pursued a doctorate (which she did not complete) in archaeology at the [[University of Chicago]] at the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]]. In 1979, she was scheduled to travel to [[Iran]] for an archaeology dig. She stopped in Poland to visit her grandmother and received word from Iran that she would have to return to the United States because of the [[Iranian Revolution]].&lt;ref name=machis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mac-history.net/apple-history-2/mac-history/2010-02-01/the-wizards-behind-the-macintosh |title=The Wizards behind the Macintosh|accessdate=2015-09-07|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Mac-history.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Hoffman was on a leave of absence from the University of Chicago when she was encouraged by her friends to attend a lecture at [[Xerox PARC]] in California.&lt;ref name="recollections"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/recollections-of-the-macs-creators/ |title=Recollections of the Mac's creators |accessdate=2015-09-07 |last=Terdiman |first=Daniel |date=2009-01-22 |publisher=[[CNET]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123082705/http://www.cnet.com/news/recollections-of-the-macs-creators/ |archivedate=January 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, she had "a heated discussion after the lecture" with [[Jef Raskin]].&lt;ref name=recollections/&gt; The discussion focused on "what computers should look like and how they should improve people's lives."&lt;ref name="recollections"/&gt; Raskin was so impressed with Hoffman that he asked her to interview for a position at Apple.&lt;ref name="recollections" /&gt; She began on the Macintosh project in October 1980&lt;ref name=hertz1&gt;{{cite book |last=Hertzfeld |first=Andy | authorlink = Andy Hertzfeld|title=[[Revolution in the Valley: The Insanely Great Story of How the Mac Was Made]] |url= |location= |publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]] |page=xxii |isbn= |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of Raskin's initial team of [[Burrell Smith]], [[Bud Tribble]], and Brian Howard.&lt;ref name=hertz2&gt;{{cite book |last=Hertzfeld |first=Andy|title=Revolution in the Valley: The Insanely Great Story of How the Mac was Made |url= |location= |publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]] |page=xxiii |isbn= |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time she began, the Mac was "still a research project"&lt;ref name=hertz1/&gt; Her position "constituted the entire Macintosh marketing team for the first year and a half of the project."&lt;ref name=machis/&gt;&lt;ref name=hertz1/&gt; She also wrote the "first draft of the Macintosh User Interface Guidelines."&lt;ref name=hertz1/&gt; Hoffman would eventually run the International Marketing Team which brought the Mac to [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref name=hertz1/&gt; She later followed [[Steve Jobs]] to [[NeXT]], as one of its original members.&lt;ref name="iswa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="out" /&gt;

Hoffman had a reputation at both Apple and NeXT as one of the few who could successfully engage with Jobs. In both 1981 and 1982, she won a satirical award at Apple given to "the person who did the best job of standing up to Jobs”. (Jobs was aware of the award and liked it.)&lt;ref name="iswa"/&gt;

During the early 1990s, Hoffman was vice president of Marketing at [[General Magic]], retiring in 1995 to spend more time with her family. On occasion she has given public lectures discussing her early life at Apple and working with Steve Jobs.&lt;ref name=hertz1/&gt;

In 2020 she was hired by the Spanish artificial intelligence company [[Sherpa]] as a consultant and the right-hand of its founder and CEO [[Xabi Uribe Etxebarria]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cincodias.elpais.com/cincodias/2020/03/05/companias/1583435140_783788.html|title=La española Sherpa ficha a Joanna Hoffman, mano derecha de Steve Jobs|last=Jiménez|first=Marimar|date=2020-03-06|website=Cinco Días|language=es|access-date=2020-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Hoffman is married to [[Alain Rossmann]], a native of France, who also worked on the Mac team at Apple, with whom she has two sons.&lt;ref name=recollections/&gt; Her children attended the [[International School of the Peninsula]] in Palo Alto, where she served on the school board.&lt;ref&gt;[https://istp.myschoolapp.com/page/Home?siteId=366&amp;ssl=1#register/15736 Hoffman Conversation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730080711/https://istp.myschoolapp.com/page/Home?siteId=366&amp;ssl=1#register/15736|date=2017-07-30}} accessed 1-27-2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayal in media==
Abigail McConnell &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3850475/ |title=Abigail McConnell|accessdate=2017-04-16|work=[[IMDb.com, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; portrayed Hoffman in the 2013 film ''[[Jobs (film)|Jobs]]''. British actress [[Kate Winslet]] portrayed Hoffman in the 2015 film ''[[Steve Jobs (film)|Steve Jobs]]''. Winslet won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture]], the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role]], and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance.&lt;ref name=tell&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/06/23/kate-winslet-little-chaos|title=What Kate Winslet would tell her 19-year-old self today|accessdate=2015-06-24|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Jeff|last=Labrecque|date=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the nature of the relationship between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet described her as Jobs' "work wife", and that "she was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve".&lt;ref name="hoffman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/08/kate-winslet-on-her-role-in-steve-jobs.html |title=How Kate Winslet Won a Role in Steve Jobs and Managed All That Sorkin Dialogue |accessdate=December 28, 2017 |last=Kachka |first=Boris |date=August 26, 2015 |publisher=Vulture |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618180609/http://www.vulture.com/2015/08/kate-winslet-on-her-role-in-steve-jobs.html |archive-date=June 18, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
