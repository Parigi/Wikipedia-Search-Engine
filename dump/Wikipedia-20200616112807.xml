[[Apple]]s appear in many [[World religions|religious traditions]], often as a [[Mysticism|mystical]] or [[forbidden fruit]]. One of the problems identifying apples in [[religion]], [[mythology]] and [[Fairy tale|folktales]] is that as late as the 17th century, the word "apple" was used as a generic term for all (foreign) fruit other than berries, but including nuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=apple|work= Online Etymology Dictionary|author= Douglas Harper, Historian|date= 25 May 2011|url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/apple}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term may even have extended to plant [[gall]]s, as they were thought to be of plant origin (see [[oak apple]]).  For instance, when [[tomato]]es were introduced into Europe, they were called "love apples".  In one Old English work, [[cucumber]]s are called ''eorþæppla'' (lit. "earth-apples'), just as in [[French language|French]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], Afrikaans, [[Persian language|Persian]]  and [[Swiss German]] as well as several other German dialects, the words for [[potato]]es mean "earth-apples".  In some languages, [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s are called "golden apples" or "Chinese apples". [[Datura]] is called "thorn-apple".

[[ethnobotany|Ethnobotanical]] and [[ethnomycology|ethnomycological]] scholars such as [[R. Gordon Wasson]], [[Carl Ruck]] and [[Clark Heinrich]] write that the mythological apple is a symbolic substitution for the [[entheogen]]ic [[Amanita muscaria]] (or fly agaric) mushroom.  Its association with knowledge is an allusion to the revelatory states described by some shamans and users of psychedelic mushrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Thus, secular art as well made use of the apple as [[symbol]] of love and sexuality. It is often an attribute associated with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] who is shown holding it.

==Mythology and religion==
{{or-section|date=September 2014}}[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Adam and Eve (Prado) 2.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Adam and Eve (Dürer)|Adam and Eve]]'': a classic depiction of the biblical tale showcasing the apple as a symbol of sin. [[Albrecht Dürer]], 1507; oil on panel.]]

Though the forbidden fruit in the [[Book of Genesis]] is not identified, popular [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition holds that [[Adam and Eve]] ate an apple from the forbidden tree in the [[Garden of Eden]]. The unnamed fruit of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] thus became an apple under the influence of the story of the [[golden apple]]s in the [[Hesperides#The Garden of the Hesperides|Garden of Hesperides]]. As a result, the apple became a symbol for [[knowledge]], [[immortality]], [[temptation]], the [[fall of man]] and sin.

The classical Greek word μήλον (mēlon), or dialectal μᾶλον (mālon), now a [[loanword]] in English as [[melon]], meant tree [[fruit]] in general,&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmh%3Dlon2 μῆλον] at [[Liddell &amp; Scott]].&lt;/ref&gt; but was borrowed into [[Latin]] as ''[[Wiktionary:malum#Noun 3|mālum]]'', meaning 'apple'. The similarity of this word to Latin ''[[Wiktionary:malum#Noun 2|mălum]]'', meaning 'evil', may also have influenced the apple's becoming interpreted as the [[Bible|biblical]] "forbidden fruit" in the commonly used Latin translation called "[[Vulgate]]".  The [[larynx]] in the human throat has been called [[Adam's apple]] because of the folk tale that the bulge was caused by the forbidden fruit sticking in the throat of Adam.  The apple as symbol of sexual seduction has sometimes been used to imply sexuality between men, possibly in an ironic vein.

[[File:La Virgen y el Niño de la manzana, por Francisco de Zurbarán.jpg|thumb|[[Francisco de Zurbarán]] - ''A Virgem da Maçã'', 1660-64]]
The notion of the apple as a symbol of sin is reflected in artistic renderings of the fall from Eden. When held in Adam's hand, the apple symbolises sin.  But, when [[Christ]] is portrayed holding an apple, he represents the Second Adam who brings life.  This difference reflects the evolution of the symbol in Christianity. In the [[Old Testament]], the apple was significant of the fall of man; in the [[New Testament]], it is an emblem of the redemption from that fall.  The apple is represented in pictures of [[the Madonna]] and [[Infant Jesus]] as another sign of that redemption.

In some versions (such as Young's Literal Translation) of the Bible, the [[Hebrew]] word for [[Mandrake#In the Bible|mandrake]]s ''dudaim'' (Genesis 30:14) is translated as "love apples" (not to be confused with the [[New World]] tomatoes).  There are several instances in the Old Testament where the apple is used in a more favourable light.  The phrase 'the apple of your eye' comes from verses in Deuteronomy 32:10, Psalm 17:8 Proverbs 7:2, and Zechariah 2:8, implying an object or person who is greatly valued.  In [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 25:11, the verse states, "''a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver''".  In the love songs of the [[Song of Solomon]], the apple is used in a sensual context.  In these latter instances, the apple is used as a symbol for beauty.  The apple appears again in Joel 1:12 in a verse with a sense of profound loss when the apple tree withers.
During the Jewish New Year - [[Rosh Hashanah]] - it is customary to eat apples dipped in honey to evoke a "new year that is good [the apple] and sweet [the honey]".

===Greek===
[[File:Nicolas Colombel 002.jpg|thumb|''Atalanta and Hippomenes'' by [[Nicolas Colombel]]]]

The [[Greek hero]] [[Heracles]], as a part of his [[Heracles#The Twelve Labours|Twelve Labours]], was required to travel to the Garden of the Hesperides and pick the golden apples off the [[Hesperides#The Garden of the Hesperides|Tree of Life]] growing at its center.

[[Atalanta]], also of Greek mythology, raced all her suitors in an attempt to avoid marriage. She outran all but [[Hippomenes]] (a.k.a. [[Melanion]], a name possibly derived from ''melon'' the Greek word for both "apple" and fruit in general), who defeated her by cunning, not speed. Hippomenes knew that he could not win in a fair race, so he used three golden apples (gifts of [[Aphrodite]], the goddess of love) to distract Atalanta. It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Hippomenes was finally successful, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.

The Greek goddess of discord, [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], became disgruntled after she was excluded from the wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]]. In retaliation, she tossed a golden apple inscribed [[Kallisti]] ('For the most beautiful one'), into the wedding party. Three goddesses claimed the apple: [[Hera]], [[Athena]], and [[Aphrodite]]. [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] of [[Troy]] was appointed to select the recipient. After being bribed by both Hera and Athena, Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world, [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] of [[Sparta]]. He awarded the apple to Aphrodite, thus indirectly causing the [[Trojan War]].

===Norse===
In [[Norse mythology]], the goddess [[Iðunn]] is strongly associated with apples. Iðunn was abducted by [[Þjazi]] the [[Jötunn|giant]], who used [[Loki]] to lure Iðunn and her apples out of [[Asgard|Ásgarðr]]. After borrowing [[Freya|Freyja's]] falcon skin, Loki liberated Iðunn from Þjazi by transforming her into a nut for the flight back. Þjazi gave chase in the form of an eagle, whereupon reaching Ásgarðr he was set aflame by a bonfire lit by the Æsir.

[[Image:Allantide.jpg|thumb|The Allantide game]]

[[Allantide]] ({{lang-kw|italic=yes|Kalan Gwav}}, meaning ''first day of winter'') is a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] festival that was traditionally celebrated on the night of 31 October, as well as the following day time. One of the most important parts of this festival was the giving of Allan apples, large glossy red apples that were highly polished, to family and friends as tokens of good luck. Allan apple markets used to be held throughout West Cornwall in the run up to the feast. and in the town of [[St Just in Penwith|St Just]] it surpassed Christmas as a time for giving gifts until the late 20th century. A game was also recorded in which two pieces of wood were nailed together in the shape of a cross. It was then suspended, with 4 lit candles on each arm and Allan apples suspended underneath. The aim being to catch the apples with your mouth without getting molten wax on your face. For unmarried recipients the apples would be placed under their pillows in the hope that they would bring dreams of their future wife or husband.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Reed - The Cornish Traditional Year 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

* Since 1990, [[Apple Day]] has been held across the UK and beyond, on October 21. This is a festival created by charity [[Common Ground (United Kingdom)|Common Ground]] to support [[Spirit of place|localism]]: folksongs, biodiversity, buried orchards, children's games.
* [[Ireland|Irish]] folklore claims that if an apple is peeled into one continuous ribbon and thrown behind a woman's shoulder, it will land in the shape of the future husband's initials.
* A popular [[folk art]] involves a process to turn apples into wrinkly representations of [[Human Head|human head]]s, usually be placed on [[Apple doll|dolls]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appledolls.org/ How to make apple dolls, purchase dolls, witches- instructions by Pamela Matson&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1975, [[Vincent Price]] promoted a horror-themed kit that used a similar process to create faux [[shrunken head]]s, Shrunken Head Apple Sculpture, by [[Whiting Crafts]].
* In some places, [[apple bobbing]] is a traditional [[Halloween]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wilstar.com/holidays/hallown.htm|title=Halloween 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the Jewish New Year - [Rosh Hashanah] - it is customary to eat apples dipped in honey to evoke a "sweet new year".
* In the [[United States]], [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]], a fresh, polished apple was a traditional children's gift for a [[teacher]], starting in the 19th century. The symbol of an apple is still strongly associated with teachers to this day, with apples being a popular theme for gifts and awards given to exemplary teachers.
* The [[Apple Wassail]] is a traditional form of [[wassailing]] practiced in [[cider]] [[orchards]] of [[South West England]] during the winter. The ceremony is said to 'bless' the apple trees to produce a good crop in the forthcoming season.

* In Kazakhstan, the ex-capital city's name "Almaty" derives from the Kazakh word for 'apple' (алма), and thus is often translated as "full of apples;" alma is also 'apple' in other Turkic languages, as well as in Hungarian.
* When Eris tossed the [[Apple of Discord]] into the feast of the gods at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, at least in historic literary terms, the reference to 'apple' would more likely have been an extinct species of the Balkans similar to the pomegranate.
