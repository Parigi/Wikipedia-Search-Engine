'''ExoMars''' ('''Exobiology on Mars''') is an [[astrobiology]] programme by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and the Russian space agency [[Roscosmos]].

The goals of ExoMars are to search for signs of past [[life on Mars]],&lt;ref name="NYT-20160912"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Visions of Life on Mars in Earth's Depths |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/south-african-mine-life-on-mars.html |date=12 September 2016 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/ast.2016.1533 Habitability on Early Mars and the Search for Biosignatures with the ExoMars Rover].

The first part of the programme is a mission launched in 2016 that placed the [[Trace Gas Orbiter]] into Mars orbit and released the [[Schiaparelli EDM|''Schiaparelli'' EDM lander]]. The orbiter is operational but the lander crashed on the planet's surface. The second part of the programme was planned to launch in July 2020, when the ''[[Kazachok]]'' lander will deliver the [[Rosalind Franklin (rover)|''Rosalind Franklin'' rover]] on the surface, supporting a [[Exploration of Mars|science mission]] that is expected to last into 2022 or beyond.&lt;ref name="NYT-20161019"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=ExoMars Mission to Join Crowd of Spacecraft at Mars |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/science/esa-mars-lander.html |date=19 October 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=19 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESA signed"&gt;{{cite news |title=ExoMars: ESA and Roscosmos set for Mars missions |date=14 March 2013 |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ExoMars_ESA_and_Roscosmos_set_for_Mars_missions |work=European Space Agency (ESA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="On track"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Amos |title=Europe |date=18 June 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22914025 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 March 2020, it was announced that the second mission was being delayed to 2022 as a result of problems with the parachutes, which could not be resolved in time for the launch window. 

The [[Trace Gas Orbiter]] (TGO) and a test stationary lander called [[Schiaparelli EDM|''Schiaparelli'']] were launched on 14 March 2016.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160314" /&gt; TGO entered Mars orbit on 19 October 2016 and proceeded to map the sources of [[Methane on Mars|methane]] ({{chem2|CH4}}) and other trace gases present in the Martian atmosphere that could be evidence for possible biological or geological activity. The TGO features four instruments and will also act as a communications relay satellite. The ''Schiaparelli'' experimental lander separated from TGO on 16 October and was maneuvered to land in [[Meridiani Planum]], but it crashed on the surface of Mars.&lt;ref name="NYT-20161021"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Dark Spot in Mars Photo Is Probably Wreckage of European Spacecraft |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/22/science/mars-crash-landing-site-explosion.html |date=21 October 2016 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=21 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The landing was designed to test new key technologies to safely deliver the subsequent rover mission.&lt;ref name="AP-20140327"&gt;{{cite news |last=Katz |first=Gregory |title=2018 mission: Mars rover prototype unveiled in UK |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20140327/DACQ6UHG0.html |date=27 March 2014 |agency=[[AP News]] |work=Excite News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Since its inception, ExoMars has gone through several phases of planning with various proposals for landers, orbiters, launch vehicles, and international cooperation planning,&lt;ref name="ExoMars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/exomars_2016.html |title=ExoMars |accessdate=22 October 2013 |work=Russian Space Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the defunct 2009 [[Mars Exploration Joint Initiative]] (MEJI) with the United States.&lt;ref name="CNet"&gt;{{cite news |first=William |last=Harwood |title=NASA budget boosts manned space, cuts Mars exploration |date=13 February 2012 |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-19514_3-57377062-239/nasa-budget-boosts-manned-space-cuts-mars-exploration/ |work=C Net News |quote="Tough choices had to be made," Bolden said.

Originally, the ExoMars concept consisted of a large robotic rover being part of ESA's [[Aurora Programme]] as a ''Flagship mission'' and was approved by the European Space Agency ministers in December 2005. Originally conceived as a rover with a stationary ground station, ExoMars was planned to launch in 2011 aboard a Russian [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz]] [[Fregat]] rocket.&lt;ref name="Europe's ExoMars rover"&gt;{{cite web |title=Europe's ExoMars rover... |date=28 August 2005 |url=http://www.spacetoday.org/SolSys/Mars/MarsExploration/MarsEuroRover.html |work=Space Today Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ExoMars begun in 2001 as part of the ESA Aurora program for the human exploration of Mars.&lt;ref name="esa.int"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ExoMars/ExoMars_frequently_asked_questions |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201183909/http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ExoMars/ExoMars_frequently_asked_questions |archive-date=1 December 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; That initial vision called for rover in 2009 and later a [[Mars sample-return mission]].&lt;ref name="esa.int"/&gt; Another mission intended to support the Aurora program is a Phobos sample return mission.&lt;ref name="esa.int"/&gt; In December 2005, the different nations composing the ESA gave approval to the Aurora program and to ExoMars.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Exploration/European_ministers_approve_the_Aurora_Exploration_Programme_and_give_green_light_for_the_ExoMars_mission ''European ministers approve the Aurora Exploration Programme and give green light for the ExoMars mission''], ESA, 12 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Aurora is an optional program and each state is allowed to decide which part of the program they want to be involved in and to what extent (e.g. how much funds they want to put into the program).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Aurora program was initiated in 2002 with support of twelve nations: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Canada&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 2007, Canadian-based technology firm MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. (MDA) was selected for a one-million-euro contract with [[EADS Astrium]] of Britain to design and build a prototype Mars rover chassis for the European Space Agency. Astrium was also contracted to design the final rover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/globaltv/national/story.html?id=67e4d15d-5ecc-4db8-9fe3-f5d904694950&amp;k=48686 |title=B.C. robotics firm lands Martian contract |publisher=CanWest News Service |date=18 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124024833/http://www.canada.com/globaltv/national/story.html?id=67e4d15d-5ecc-4db8-9fe3-f5d904694950&amp;k=48686 |archivedate=24 November 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2009 NASA and ESA signed the [[Mars Exploration Joint Initiative]], which proposed to utilise an Atlas rocket launcher instead of a Soyuz, which significantly altered the technical and financial setting of the ExoMars mission. On 19 June, when the rover was still planned to piggyback the [[Mars Trace Gas Orbiter]], it was reported that a prospective agreement would require that ExoMars lose enough weight to fit aboard the Atlas launch vehicle with a NASA orbiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacenews.com/civil/nasa-could-take-role-european-exomars-mission.html |title=NASA Could Take Role in European ExoMars Mission |work=Space News |date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then the mission was combined with other projects to a multi-spacecraft mission divided over two [[Atlas V]]-launches:&lt;ref name="oct-proposal"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael A. |last=Taverna |title=ESA Proposes Two ExoMars Missions |date=19 October 2009 |publisher=[[Aviation Week]] |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&amp;id=news/Exomars101909.xml&amp;headline=ESA%20Proposes%20Two%20ExoMars%20Missions }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oct-proposal"/&gt;&lt;ref name=oct12 &gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Amos |title=Europe's Mars plans move forward |date=12 October 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8302876.stm |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]] (TGO) was merged into the project, piggybacking a stationary meteorological lander slated for launch in January 2016. It was also proposed to include a second rover, the [[Mars Astrobiology Explorer-Cacher|MAX-C]].

In August 2009 it was announced that the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (now Roscosmos) and ESA had signed a contract that included cooperation on two Mars exploration projects: Russia's [[Fobos-Grunt]] project and ESA's ExoMars. Specifically, ESA secured a Russian [[Proton (rocket)|Proton rocket]] as a "backup launcher" for the ExoMars rover, which would include Russian-made parts.&lt;ref name=avio &gt;{{cite news |title=Agreement between ESA and Roscosmos signed at "MAKS 2009" |date=20 August 2009 |publisher=Avio News |url=http://www.avionews.com/index.php?corpo=see_news_home.php&amp;news_id=1108379&amp;pagina_chiamante=index.php |work=WAPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=red &gt;{{cite news |title=ESA, Roscosmos Strike Mars Deal |date=20 August 2009 |url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/space/1740298/esa_roscosmos_strike_mars_deal/ |work=Red Orbit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 December 2009, the ESA governments gave their final approval to a two-part Mars exploration mission to be conducted with NASA, confirming their commitment to spend €850 million ($1.23 billion) on missions in 2016 and 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter B. |last=de Selding |title=ESA Approves Collaborative Mars Program with NASA |date=18 December 2009 |url=http://www.space.com/news/091218-exomars-mission.html |work=Space News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, because of a budgeting crisis, a proposal was announced to cancel the accompanying [[Mars Astrobiology Explorer-Cacher|MAX-C]] rover, and fly only one rover in 2018 that would be larger than either of the vehicles in the paired concept.&lt;ref name="single rover"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Amos |title=US and Europe mull single 2018 Mars rover |date=7 April 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13002214 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; One suggestion was that the new vehicle would be built in Europe and carry a mix of European and U.S. instruments. NASA would provide the rocket to deliver it to Mars and provide the [[Mars Science Laboratory#Sky crane landing|sky crane landing system]]. Despite the proposed reorganisation, the goals of the 2018 mission opportunity would have stayed broadly the same.&lt;ref name="single rover" /&gt;

Under the FY2013 Budget President Obama released on 13 February 2012, NASA terminated its participation in ExoMars due to budgetary cuts in order to pay for the cost overruns of the [[James Webb Space Telescope]].&lt;ref name="Feb 14"&gt;{{cite news |first=Frank |last=Morring, Jr. |title=NASA Units Hope For Robotic Mars Mission in 2018 |date=14 February 2012 |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/asd_02_14_2012_p01-02-424988.xml |work=Aviation Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ken |last=Kremer |title=Experts React to Obama Slash to NASA's Mars and Planetary Science Exploration |date=1 February 2012 |url=http://www.universetoday.com/93512/experts-react-to-obama-slash-to-nasas-mars-and-planetary-science-exploration/ |work=Universe Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; With NASA's funding for this project completely cancelled, most of these plans had to be restructured.&lt;ref name="cancellation" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Wall |title=When Exploring Other Planets, International Cooperation Is Key |date=22 August 2012 |publisher=Space.com |url=http://www.space.com/17225-planetary-exploration-international-cooperation.html |work=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March 2013, representatives of the ESA and the [[Russian Federal Space Agency|Russian space agency]] (Roscosmos), signed a deal in which Russia became a full partner. Roscosmos will supply both missions with [[Proton (rocket)|Proton launch vehicles]] with [[Briz-M]] upper stages and launch services,&lt;ref name="Proton+BrizM"&gt;{{cite news |work=Staff |title=Russian-European spacecraft to go on Martian mission in Jan 2016 |date=10 February 2014 |url=http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2014_02_10/Russian-European-spacecraft-to-go-on-Martian-mission-in-Jan-2016-9740/ |publisher=The Voice of Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an additional entry, descent and landing module for the rover mission in 2018.&lt;ref name="ESA signed" /&gt; Under the agreement, Roscosmos was granted three asking conditions:&lt;ref name="Gazeta"&gt;{{cite news |first=Nikolai |last=Podorvanyuk |title=Insurance from "Phobos-Grunt" to fly to Mars |date=30 March 2012 |url=http://www.gazeta.ru/science/2012/03/30_a_4111965.shtml |work=Gazeta |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* to search for possible [[biosignature]]s of past [[Life on Mars (planet)|Martian life]].
* to characterise the [[Water on Mars|water]] and [[geochemical]] distribution as a function of depth in the shallow subsurface.
* to study the surface environment and identify hazards to future [[Manned mission to Mars|manned missions to Mars]].
* to investigate the planet's subsurface and deep interior to better understand the evolution and habitability of Mars.
* achieve incremental steps ultimately culminating in a [[Mars sample-return mission|sample return flight]].

The technological objectives to develop are:
* landing of large [[Payload (air and space craft)|payloads]] on Mars.
* to exploit [[Solar power|solar electric power]] on the surface of Mars.
* to access the subsurface with a drill able to collect samples down to a depth of {{convert|2|m|ft}}
* to develop surface exploration capability using a rover.

== Mission profile ==

ExoMars is a joint programme of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and the Russian space agency [[Roscosmos]]. According to current plans, the ExoMars project will comprise four spacecraft: two stationary landers, one orbiter and one rover. All mission elements will be sent in two launches using two heavy-lift [[Proton (rocket)|Proton]] rockets.&lt;ref name="still keen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Selding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Svitak"&gt;{{cite news |first=Amy |last=Svitak |title=Europe Joins Russia on Robotic ExoMars |date=16 March 2012 |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&amp;id=news/awx/2012/03/15/awx_03_15_2012_p0-437120.xml&amp;headline=Europe%20Joins%20Russia%20on%20Robotic%20ExoMars |work=Aviation Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two landing modules and the rover will be cleaned and [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilised]] to prevent contaminating Mars with Earth life forms, and also to ensure that any biomolecules detected were not carried from Earth. Cleaning will require a combination of sterilising methods, including [[ionising radiation]], [[UV]] radiation, and chemicals such as ethyl and isopropyl alcohol.&lt;ref name="Proton+BrizM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://phys.org/news/2014-10-mars.html |title=Packing for Mars |work=Pys Org |date=22 October 2014 |accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Planetary protection]]).

It delivered the ExoMars Schiaparelli EDM lander and then proceed to map the sources of [[methane on Mars]] and other gases, and in doing so, will help select the landing site for the ExoMars [[Rover (space exploration)|rover]] to be launched in 2020. The presence of methane in Mars' atmosphere is intriguing because its likely origin is either present-day life or geological activity. Upon the arrival of the rover in 2021, the orbiter would be transferred into a lower orbit where it would be able to perform analytical science activities as well as provide the Schiaparelli EDM lander and ExoMars rover with telecommunication relay. NASA provided an ''Electra'' telecommunications relay and navigation instrument to ensure communications between probes and rovers on the surface of Mars and controllers on Earth.&lt;ref name="ESA signed" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter B. |last=de Selding |title=U.S., Europe Won't Go It Alone in Mars Exploration |date=26 September 2012 |url=http://www.spacenews.com/civil/120926-us-europe-mars-exploration.html |work=Space News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TGO would continue serving as a telecommunication relay satellite for future landed missions until 2022.&lt;ref name="June 2011"&gt;{{citation |first=Mark |last=Allen |first2=Olivier |last2=Witasse |title=MEPAG June 2011 |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |date=16 June 2011 |url=http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meeting/jun-11/13-EMTGO_MEPAG_June2011_presentation-rev2.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929004716/http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/meeting/jun-11/13-EMTGO_MEPAG_June2011_presentation-rev2.pdf|archive-date=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Rosalind Franklin'' rover includes the Pasteur instrument suite, including the [[Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer]] (MOMA), [[MicrOmega-IR]], and the [[Raman Laser Spectrometer]] (RLS). Examples of external instruments on the rover include:
*[[Mars Multispectral Imager for Subsurface Studies]]
*[[Infrared Spectrometer for ExoMars]]
*[[ADRON-RM]]

== Landing site selection ==
[[File:NASA-OxiaPlanum-GeologicalContext-Morphology-20140514.jpg|thumb|300px| [[Oxia Planum]], near the equator, is the selected landing site for its potential to preserve biosignatures and smooth surface ]]

A primary goal when selecting the rover's landing site is to identify a particular geologic environment, or set of environments, that would support —now or in the past— microbial life. The scientists prefer a landing site with both morphologic and mineralogical evidence for past water. Furthermore, a site with spectra indicating multiple [[Mineral hydration|hydrated minerals]] such as [[clay minerals]] is preferred, but it will come down to a balance between engineering constraints and scientific goals.&lt;ref name="site selection 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Grindrod |first=Peter |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2014/mar/26/life-mars-exomars-spacecraft-landing-site |title=Searching for life on Mars: where should the ExoMars rover land? |work=The Guardian |date=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineering constraints call for a flat landing site in a latitude band straddling the equator that is only 30° latitude from top to bottom because the rover is solar-powered and will need best sunlight exposure.&lt;ref name="site selection 2014" /&gt; The landing module carrying the rover will have a landing ellipse that measures about 105&amp;nbsp;km by 15&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="Sites March 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-26743089 |title=Europe begins Mars site selection |work=BBC News |date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scientific requirements include landing in an area with 3.6 billion years old [[sedimentary rock]]s that are a record of the past wet habitable environment.&lt;ref name="site selection 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exploration.esa.int/mars/53462-call-for-exomars-2018-landing-site-selection/ |title=Call for ExoMars 2018 Landing Site Selection |publisher=ESA |date=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The year before launch, the European Space Agency will make the final decision.&lt;ref name="site selection 2014" /&gt; By March 2014, the long list was:&lt;ref name="Sites March 2014" /&gt;
{{div col|colwidth=10em}}
* [[Oxia Palus quadrangle|Aram Dorsum]]
* [[Coogoon Valles]]
* [[Hypanis Vallis]]
* [[Mawrth Vallis]]
* [[Oxia Planum]]
* [[Simud Valles]]
* [[Southern Isidis]]
{{div col end}}
Following additional review by an ESA-appointed panel, four sites, all of which are located relatively near the equator, were formally recommended in October 2014 for further detailed analysis:&lt;ref name="4 candidate sites"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spaceref.com/mars/four-candidate-landing-sites-for-exomars-2018.html |title=Four Candidate Landing Sites for ExoMars 2018 |work=ESA |publisher=Space Ref |date=1 October 2014 |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exploration.esa.int/jump.cfm?oid=54707 |title=Recommendation for the Narrowing of ExoMars 2018 Landing Sites |work=ESA |date=1 October 2014 |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{div col|colwidth=10em}}
* [[Oxia Palus quadrangle|Aram Dorsum]]
* [[Hypanis Vallis]]
* [[Mawrth Vallis]]
* [[Oxia Planum]]
{{div col end}}
On 21 October 2015, [[Oxia Planum]] was reported to be the preferred landing site for the [[ExoMars rover]].&lt;ref name="BBC-20151021"&gt;{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |title=ExoMars rover: Landing preference is for Oxia Planum |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-34584214 |date=21 October 2015 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UT-20151021"&gt;{{cite web |last=Atkinson |first=Nancy |title=Scientists Want ExoMars Rover to Land at Oxia Planum |url=http://www.universetoday.com/123018/scientists-want-exomars-rover-to-land-at-oxia-planum/ |date=21 October 2015 |work=[[Universe Today]] |accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The delay of the rover mission to 2020 from 2018 meant that Oxia Planum was no longer the only favourable landing site due to changes in the possible [[Landing footprint|landing ellipse]]. Both Mawrth Vallis and Aram Dorsum, surviving candidates from the previous selection, could be reconsidered. ESA convened further workshops to re-evaluate the three remaining options and in March 2017 selected two sites to study in detail.&lt;ref name="2 sites"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ExoMars/Final_two_ExoMars_landing_sites_chosen|title=Final two ExoMars landing sites chosen|date=28 March 2017|work=[[European Space Agency]]|accessdate=31 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401054707/http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ExoMars/Final_two_ExoMars_landing_sites_chosen|archive-date=1 April 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{div col|colwidth=10em}}

{{div col end}}
On 9 November 2018, ESA announced that [[Oxia Planum]] was favoured by the Landing Site Selection Working Group. An official confirmation is expected mid-2019 after ESA and Roscosmos review the recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://exploration.esa.int/mars/60914-oxia-planum-favoured-for-exomars-surface-mission/|title=Oxia Planum favoured for ExoMars surface mission|date=9 November 2018|website=[[European Space Agency]]|language=en-GB|access-date=17 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The favored Oxia Planum landing ellipse is situated at 18.20°N, 335.45°E.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://exploration.esa.int/mars/54724-oxia-planum/|title=Oxia Planum|date=27 March 2017|website=[[European Space Agency]]|language=en-GB|access-date=17 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
