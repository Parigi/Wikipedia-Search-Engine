"'''Like I Love You'''" is the debut single recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Justin Timberlake]] for his debut studio album, ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]'' (2002), which features American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] duo [[Clipse]]. It was co-written by Timberlake and [[The Neptunes]] ([[Chad Hugo]] and [[Pharrell Williams]]), who also produced it. The song was released on August 26, 2002, as Timberlake's debut solo single, following the announced hiatus of [[NSYNC]] earlier that year. According to Williams, the song's drums were an ode to the [[funk]] era.

The song peaked at number 11 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number two in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2366375.stm|title=Timberlake fails to top chart|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=27 October 2002|accessdate=25 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was performed by Timberlake at the [[2002 MTV Video Music Awards]] in [[New York City]], on August 29, 2002. It also received a nomination at the [[Grammy Awards of 2003]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration|Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1459402/20030107/nelly.jhtml|title=Eminem, Avril, Norah Jones nab most Grammy noms|first=Joe|last=D'Angelo|date=7 January 2003|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=25 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[MTV News]]'' reported in July 2002 that [[Chad Hugo]] and [[Pharrell Williams]] (known collectively as [[The Neptunes]]) were working on multiple tracks for ''Justified''.&lt;ref name="mtv"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1456207/timberlake-solo-lp-tightly-guarded.jhtml|title=Justin Timberlake Working 'NSecret On Star-Packed Solo LP|last=Moss|first=Corey|date=July 23, 2002|publisher=[[MTV News]]. [[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]]|accessdate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the duo picked Timberlake up from his hotel in [[Virginia Beach]], they listened to [[Earth, Wind &amp; Fire]] albums during the car ride. The background of the songs was the feeling the duo wanted to implement into the musical content of the album.&lt;ref name="mtv3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1457175/preview-timberlake-album.jhtml|title=Preview Of Justin Timberlake Album From Neptunes' Hugo|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=August 26, 2002|publisher=MTV News. Viacom|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, Timberlake said: "Nobody's ever heard anything like that before ... a white boy singing this kind of music." Hugo revealed that Timberlake "didn't care what people would say."&lt;ref name="mtv3"/&gt; The production duo commented that despite not being content with sampling music, for inspiration, they listened to both ''[[Off the Wall (album)|Off the Wall]]'' and ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'', albums by [[Michael Jackson]].&lt;ref name="mtv3"/&gt; Hugo commented that "We just wanted to re-create that sense of those timeless, classic songs, without any of the 'bling, bling, hit me on my two-way' style of the new R&amp;B. It has elements of the old and the new."&lt;ref name="mtv3"/&gt;

"Like I Love You" was the first song they recorded together and the first song Timberlake recorded for ''Justified''.&lt;ref name="Timberlake, Janet Jackson Make Sexy Pair"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1457770/janet-gets-sexy-on-justin-cd.jhtml|title=Timberlake, Janet Jackson Make Sexy Pair on Justified|author=MTV News Staff|website=[[MTV News]]|date=September 24, 2002|access-date=February 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was written by Timberlake, Hugo and Williams, while the production was done by the latter two. The song features a [[rap music|rap verse]] written and performed by hip hop duo [[Clipse]].&lt;ref name="Notes"/&gt; "Like I Love You" was recorded at Master Sound Recording Studios and Windmark Recording both located in [[Virginia Beach]] with Andrew Coleman serving as a [[recording engineer]].&lt;ref name="Notes"/&gt; Serban Ghenea [[Mixing (music production)|mixed]] the song at Windmark Recording, while Daniel Botancourt and Tim Roberts were additional engineers.&lt;ref name="Notes"/&gt; John Hanes provided the additional Pro Tools engineering. All the [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]] was delivered by Hugo and Williams, while the song's vocal arrangement was provided by Williams together with Timberlake.&lt;ref name="Notes"/&gt;

==Release==
"Like I Love You" was chosen as Timberlake's debut single and the [[lead single]] of ''Justified''. According to Timberlake, there was "never any question" in his mind whether or not the song would be released as his debut single. Of the song, Timberlake said: "It sounded so original to me. And I kind of consider myself a new artist. This is a new beginning for me, so why call on some big-name hip-hop artist when I could get somebody that feels new so it could feel like we were {{sic|chomping|hide=y}} at the bit at the same time?"&lt;ref name="Timberlake, Janet Jackson Make Sexy Pair"/&gt;

On October 14, 2002, a [[CD single]] was released in Germany containing the album version of the song, its instrumental and two club extended mixes.&lt;ref name="german cd single"/&gt; The same version of the single was released in Canada on October 17, 2002.&lt;ref name="canada vinyl" /&gt; In the UK, the album version of "Like I Love You", its instrumental and one extended remix was physically released on October 22, 2002.&lt;ref name="uk cd single"/&gt; The song was released as a [[12-inch single|12" vinyl]] on November 19, 2002, in Italy and Spain.&lt;ref name="it vinyl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="es vinyl"/&gt; On November 24, 2002, it was also released in France as a CD single.&lt;ref name="fr single"/&gt;

==Critical reception==
{{Quote box|width=300px|align=right|quote="This is quite possibly the best post-boy-band debut single of all time. He booked the hottest producers (The Neptunes) and a bubbling-under hip-hop duo (Clipse) to show that the bubblegum had officially popped. There couldn't have been a better introduction to Justin Timberlake, solo star."|source=—''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Katie Atkinson in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7357881/justin-timberlake-singles-ranked-cant-stop-the-feeling |title=Critic's Choice: Every Justin Timberlake Single Ranked |last=Atkinson |first=Katie |date=May 6, 2016 |work=Billboard |access-date=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The song received positive reviews from music critics. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Craig Seymour wrote "Over a lo-fi [[The Neptunes|Neptunes]]-produced track dashed with Spanish guitar, live drums, and ''Planet Rock''-like electro bleeps... [Justin proves that] while no innovator, he is a fine student".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Craig |last=Seymour |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,348170,00.html |title=Music Capsule review - Like I Love You |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=May 25, 2009 |date=September 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of the album ''Justified'' for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Ben Ratliff wrote "In Like I Love You, a nasty funk rhythm on loud, live drums shares the space with a tiny guitar strum and Timberlake's breathy, studied tenor; it's minimalism influenced by Michael Jackson. But a softer, harmony-and-hook-filled chorus sets it off, thus pleasing preteen girls and beat junkies alike."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Ben |last=Ratliff |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/justintimberlake/albums/album/104698/review/6068220/justified |title=Justin Timberlake: Justified: Music Review |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=November 4, 2002 |accessdate=May 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denise Boyd, writing for [[BBC|BBC Music]], said that the song was a "sure bet for success" with The Neptunes producing the song but "Justin's vocal arrangement has given this offering a distinctive edge and it stands out as one of the best Neptunes productions this year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Denise |last=Boyd|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/vdmq |title=BBC Music - Review of Justin Timberlake - Justified |work=BBC Music |publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=20 November 2002 |accessdate=25 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' called it a "well-oiled Neptunes production" and "the acoustic guitar loops and snap-crackle-pop percussion of "Like I Love You" pick up where [[NSYNC]]'s hit "[[Girlfriend (NSYNC song)|Girlfriend]]" left off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Sal |last=Cinquemani |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=230 |title=Justin Timberlake: Justified - Music review |magazine=[[Slant Magazine]] |date=November 8, 2002 |accessdate=25 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115230559/http://slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=230 |archivedate=January 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Lauren Nostro from ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' wrote, "The song catapulted Timberlake's career... It was the quintessential R&amp;B/pop/hip-hop track filled with soulful lyrics and a heavy beat. It presented JT as a full-fledged musician, and not just the lead singer of 'N Sync."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/03/the-25-best-justin-timberlake-songs/justin-timberlake-like-i-love-you |title=The 25 Best Justin Timberlake Songs |date=March 15, 2013 |work=Complex |access-date=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adelle Platon from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' opined in 2016, "This groovy number cemented J.T.'s solo career as a genre-fusing wunderkind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7633393/justin-timberlake-best-hip-hop-rb-collaborations|title=Justin Timberlake's 14 Best Hip-Hop/R&amp;B Collaborations|last=Platon|first=Adelle|date=December 27, 2016|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' staff ranked it as the best boy-band solo debut single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2017/04/boy-band-solo-singles-ranked/|title=Best Boy Band Solo Debut Singles, Ranked|date=April 20, 2017|website=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|author=Spin Staff|access-date=July 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
