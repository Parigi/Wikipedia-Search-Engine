[[File:Cross_(PSF).png|thumb|Christian cross variants]]

[[File:Greek and Latin cross - Temple of Saint Sava_and St Paul's Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Greek cross (Church of Saint Sava) and Latin cross (St. Paul's cathedral) in church floorplans]]

This is a list of '''Christian cross variants'''.  The [[Christian cross]], with or without a figure of Christ included, is the main [[religious symbol]] of [[Christianity]].  A cross with a figure of Christ affixed to it is termed a '''[[crucifix]]''' and the figure is often referred to as the '''corpus''' ([[Latin]] for "body").

The term ''Greek cross'' designates a cross with arms of equal length, as in a plus sign, while the [[Latin cross]] designates a cross with an elongated descending arm. Numerous other variants have been developed during the [[medieval period]].

Christian crosses are used widely in churches, on top of church buildings, on bibles, in heraldry, in personal jewelry, on hilltops, and elsewhere as an attestation or other symbol of Christianity.
Crosses are a prominent feature of Christian [[cemeteries]], either carved on [[gravestone]]s or as sculpted [[stela]]e. Because of this, planting small crosses is sometimes used in countries of [[Christian culture]] to mark the site of fatal accidents, or, such as the [[Zugspitze]] or [[Mount Royal]], so as to be visible over the entire surrounding area.
[[Roman Catholic]], Anglican and Lutheran depictions of the cross are often crucifixes, in order to emphasize that it is Jesus that is important, rather than the cross in isolation. Large crucifixes are a prominent feature of some Lutheran churches, e.g. as a [[rood]].  However, some other [[Protestant]] traditions depict the cross without the corpus, interpreting this form as an indication of belief in the resurrection rather than as representing the interval between the death and the resurrection of Jesus.

Several Christian cross variants are available in computer-displayed text. A Latin cross ("†") is included in the extended ASCII character set&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ASCII Code - The extended ASCII table |url=https://www.ascii-code.com/ |website=ASCII-Code.com |accessdate=28 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and several variants have been added to [[Unicode]], starting with the Latin cross in version 1.1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unicode Character “✝” (U+271D) |url=https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+271D |website=Compart.com |accessdate=28 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

|[[Huguenot cross]]
|The symbolism of the Huguenot cross is particularly rich. The cross as an eminent symbol of the Christian faith, represents not only the death of Christ but also victory over death and impiety. This is represented also in the Maltese cross. It is boutonné, the eight points symbolising the eight Beatitudes (Matthew 5:3–12) Between the arms of the cross is the stylised fleur-de-lys (on the French Coat of Arms), each has 3 petals; the total of twelve petals of the fleur-de-lys signify the twelve apostles. Between each fleur-de-lys and the arms of the Maltese cross with which it is joined, an open space in the form of a heart, the symbol of loyalty, suggests the seal of the French Reformer, John Calvin. The pendant dove symbolises the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:16). In times of persecution a pearl, symbolizing a teardrop, replaced the dove.
