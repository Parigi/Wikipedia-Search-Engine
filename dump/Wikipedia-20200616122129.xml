[[File:Disco de Teodosio.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Missorium of Theodosius I|Missorium of Emperor Theodosius I]], who made Nicene Christianity the state religion of the Roman Empire. This piece was found in [[Almendralejo]].]]
With the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] in 380 AD, Emperor [[Theodosius I]] made [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicene Christianity]] the [[Roman Empire|Empire's]] [[state religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Forster (2008), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tony Honoré]] (1998), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and the [[Catholic Church]] each claim to stand in continuity with the church to which Theodosius granted recognition, but do not look on it as specific to the Roman Empire. 

Earlier in the 4th century, following the [[Diocletianic Persecution]] of 303–313 and the [[Donatism|Donatist controversy]] that arose in consequence, [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] had convened councils of bishops to define the ''[[orthodoxy]]'' of the Christian faith, expanding on earlier Christian councils. A series of [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical councils]] convened by successive emperors met during the 4th and 5th centuries, but Christianity continued to suffer rifts and schisms surrounding the issues of [[Arianism]], [[Nestorianism]], and [[Miaphysitism]]. In the 5th century, the [[Western Empire]] decayed as a [[polity]]: invaders sacked [[Rome]] in [[Sack of Rome (410)|410]] and in [[Sack of Rome (455)|455]], and [[Odoacer]], an Arian barbarian warlord, forced [[Romulus Augustus]], the last nominal Western Emperor, [[deposition of Romulus Augustulus|to abdicate in 476]]. However, apart from the aforementioned schisms, the church as an institution persisted in [[Communion (Christian)|communion]], if not without tension, between the [[Eastern Christianity|east]] and [[Western Christianity|west]]. In the 6th century the Byzantine armies of the [[Eastern Roman Emperor]] [[Justinian I]] recovered Italy and other sections of the western Mediterranean shore. The [[Eastern Roman Empire]] soon lost most of these gains, but it held Rome, as part of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]], until 751, a period known in [[church history]] as the [[Byzantine Papacy]]. The [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century would begin a process of converting most of the then-Christian world in [[West Asia]] and [[North Africa]] to Islam, severely restricting the reach both of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and of its church. Missionary activity directed from [[Constantinople]], the Byzantine capital, did not lead to a lasting expansion of the formal link between the church and the Byzantine emperor, since areas outside the empire's political and military control set up their own distinct churches, as in the case of [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church#Autocephaly (Patriarchate)|Bulgaria]] in 919.

[[Justinian I]], who became emperor in Constantinople in 527, recognized the [[patriarch]]s of [[Pope|Rome]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]] and [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] as the top [[leadership]] of the Church (see [[Pentarchy]]). However, Justinian claimed "the right and duty of regulating by his laws the minutest details of worship and discipline, and also of dictating the theological opinions to be held in the Church".&lt;ref name="Ayer 1913, p. 553"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Talbott|title=The Inescapable Love of God: Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L6WPBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|year=2014|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-62564-690-3|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Justinian's day, the Christian church was not entirely under the Emperor's control even in the East: the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] had seceded, having rejected the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, and called the adherents of the imperially recognized Church "[[Melkite]]s", from Syriac ''malkâniya'' "imperial".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aloys Grillmeier|title=Christ in Christian Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Hw28f8aCnoC&amp;pg=PA63|year=1996|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22300-7|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Hitchcock|title=History of the Catholic Church: From the Apostolic Age to the Third Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nt_n7wuugAC&amp;pg=PA209|year=2012|publisher=Ignatius Press|isbn=978-1-58617-664-8|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; In western Europe, Christianity was mostly subject to the laws and customs of nations that owed no allegiance to the emperor in Constantinople.&lt;ref name="Ayer 1913, pp. 538-539"&gt;Ayer (1913), pp. 538–539&lt;/ref&gt; While eastern-born [[Byzantine Papacy|popes]] appointed or at least confirmed by the Eastern Emperor continued to be loyal to him as their political lord, they refused to accept his authority in religious matters,&lt;ref&gt;Ekonomou (2007), p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; or the authority of such a council as the imperially convoked [[Council of Hieria]] of 754. [[Pope Gregory III]] (731–741) was the last Bishop of Rome to ask the Byzantine ruler to ratify his election.&lt;ref&gt;Granfield (2000), p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noble (1984), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; With the crowning of [[Charlemagne]] by [[Pope Leo III]] on [[Christmas|25 December]] 800 as ''[[Holy Roman Emperor|Imperator Romanorum]]'', the political split between east and west became irrevocable. Spiritually, [[Chalcedonian Christianity]] persisted, at least in theory, as a unified entity until the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] and its formal division with the [[Christianity in the 11th century#Mutual excommunication of 1054|mutual excommunication in 1054]] of Rome and [[Constantinople]]. The Eastern Roman Empire finally collapsed with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the Islamic [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453.

The obliteration of the Empire's boundaries by [[Germanic peoples]] and an outburst of missionary activity among these peoples, who had no direct links with the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]], and among [[Picts|Pictic]] and [[Celtic peoples]] who had never been part of the Roman Empire, fostered the idea of a universal church free from association with a particular state.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03096a.htm Gerland, Ernst. "The Byzantine Empire"] in The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. Retrieved 19 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, "in the East Roman or Byzantine view, when the Roman Empire became Christian, the perfect world order willed by God had been achieved: one universal empire was sovereign, and coterminous with it was the one universal church"; and the church came, by the time of the demise of the Byzantine  Empire in 1453, to merge psychologically with it to the extent that its bishops had difficulty in thinking of Christianity without an emperor.&lt;ref name="Schadé 2006"&gt;Schadé (2006), art. "Byzantine Church"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; In 1393, [[Patriarch Antony IV of Constantinople]] declared the Byzantine emperor to be "emperor (βασιλεύς) and autokrator of the Romans, that is ''of all Christians'',{{harvnb|Meyendorff|1996|pp=89}} and "it is not possible among Christians to have a Church and not to have an emperor. For the empire and the Church have great unity and commonality, and it is not possible to separate them" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=L0EbAAAAYAAJ Dimitri Obolensky, ''The Byzantine Inheritance of Eastern Europe''] (Variorum Reprints 1969 {{ISBN|978-0-86078102-8}}), p. 339).&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern authors refer to the church associated with the emperor in a variety of ways: as the ''catholic church'', the ''orthodox church'', the ''imperial church'', the ''imperial Roman church'', or the ''Byzantine church'', although some of these terms are also used for wider communions extending outside the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Latourette (1983), p. 175.&lt;br/&gt;Schaff (1883), p. 179.&lt;br/&gt;Irvin (2002), p. 160.&lt;br/&gt;O'Hare (1997), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy of the idea of a [[universal church (disambiguation)|universal church]] carries on, directly or indirectly, in today's [[Catholic Church]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], as well as in others, such as the [[Anglican Communion]].

===Early Christianity in relation to the state===
{{Further information|Early Christianity}}
[[File:Chrisme Colosseum Rome Italy crop.jpg|thumb|Monogramme of Christ (the [[Chi Rho]]) on a plaque of a [[sarcophagus]], 4th-century AD, marble, Musei Vaticani, on display in a temporary exhibition at the Colosseum in Rome, Italy]]
Before the end of the 1st century, the Roman authorities recognized Christianity as a [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|separate religion from Judaism]]. The distinction, perhaps already made in practice at the time of the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in the year 64, was given official status by the emperor [[Nerva]] around the year 98 by granting Christians exemption from paying the ''[[Fiscus Iudaicus]]'', the annual tax upon the Jews. [[Pliny the Younger]], when [[promagistrate|propraetor]] in [[Bithynia]] in 103, assumes in his letters to [[Trajan]] that because Christians do not pay the tax, they are not Jews.&lt;ref name="Wylen 1995. Pp 190-192"&gt;Wylen (1995). pp. 190–192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunn 1999. Pp 33-34"&gt;Dunn (1999). pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boatwright 2004. Pg 426"&gt;Boatwright (2004). p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since paying taxes had been one of the ways that Jews demonstrated their goodwill and loyalty toward the Empire, Christians had to negotiate their own alternatives to participating in the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]]. Their refusal to worship the [[Roman gods]] or to pay homage to the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|emperor as divine]] resulted at times in persecution and martyrdom.&lt;ref name="Wylen 1995. Pp 190-192"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunn 1999. Pp 33-34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boatwright 2004. Pg 426"/&gt; [[Church Father]] [[Tertullian]], for instance, attempted to argue that Christianity was not inherently treasonous, and that Christians could offer their own form of prayer for the well-being of the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''[[Apologeticus]]'' 30.1, as discussed by Cecilia Ames, "Roman Religion in the Vision of Tertullian," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), pp. 467–468 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Early centers of Christianity|Christianity spread]] especially in the eastern parts of the Empire and beyond its border; in the west it was at first relatively limited, but significant Christian communities emerged in [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|Rome]], [[Early centers of Christianity#Carthage|Carthage]], and other urban centers, becoming by the end of the [[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd century]], the dominant faith in some of them. Christians accounted for approximately 10% of the Roman population by 300, according to some estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins(1998), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Will Durant]], the [[Christian Church]] prevailed over [[paganism]] because it offered a much more attractive doctrine and because the church leaders addressed human needs better than their rivals.&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;Durant, Will. Caesar and Christ. New York: Simon and Schuster. 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

In 301, the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]], nominally a Roman client kingdom but ruled by a [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] dynasty,&lt;ref&gt;Redgate, Anne Elizabeth (2000). The Armenians (First ed.). Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishers, p. 88–91. {{ISBN|0-631-22037-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; became the first nation to adopt Christianity as its [[state religion]].

In 311, with the [[Edict of Serdica]] the dying Emperor [[Galerius]] ended the [[Diocletianic Persecution]] that he is reputed to have instigated, and in 313, Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]], granting to Christians and others "the right of open and free observance of their worship".&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 45.1, 48.2, qtd. and tr. in Graeme Clarke, "Third-Century Christianity" in ''The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume XII: The Crisis of Empire'', edited by Alan Bowman, Averil Cameron, and Peter Garnsey, 589–671. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-521-30199-8}}, pp. 662–663&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine began to utilize Christian symbols such as the [[Chi-Rho]] early in his reign but still encouraged traditional Roman religious practices including [[Sol invictus#Constantine|sun worship]]. In 330, Constantine established the city of [[Constantinople]] as the new capital of the Roman Empire. The city would gradually come to be seen as the intellectual and cultural center of the Christian world.&lt;ref&gt;Payton (2007), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century the Christian body]] became consumed by debates surrounding [[orthodoxy]], i.e. which religious doctrines are the correct ones. In the early 4th century, a group in [[North Africa during Antiquity|North Africa]], later called [[Donatism|Donatists]], who believed in a very rigid interpretation of Christianity that excluded many who had abandoned the faith during the Diocletianic persecution, created a crisis in the western Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Irvin (2002), p. 164, ch. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[synod]] was held in [[Synod of Rome (313)|Rome in 313]], followed by another in [[Synod of Arles (314)|Arles in 314]]. These synods ruled that the Donatist faith was heresy and, when the Donatists refused to recant, Constantine launched the first campaign of persecution by Christians against Christians, and began imperial involvement in Christian theology. However, during the reign of Emperor [[Julian the Apostate]], the Donatists, who formed the majority party in the Roman province of Africa for 30 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/26375/Julian-as-discussed-in-Donatist-religion|title=Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Facts about Julian: Donatists''}}&lt;/ref&gt; were given official approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://evangelica.de/articles/the-donatists-and-their-relation-to-church-and-state/|title=The Donatists and Their Relation to Church and State « Biographia Evangelica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Debates within Christianity ====
Christian scholars and populace within the Empire were increasingly embroiled in debates regarding [[christology]] (i.e., regarding the nature of the [[Christ]]). Opinions ranged from belief that Jesus was [[Jewish Christianity|entirely human]] to belief that he was [[Docetism|entirely divine]]. The most persistent debate was that between the [[Homoousios|homoousian]] view (the Father and the Son are of one substance), defined at the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council at Nicaea]] in 325 and later championed by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], and the [[Arianism|Arian]] view (the Father and the Son are similar, but the Father is greater than the Son). Emperors thereby became ever more involved with the increasingly divided Church.&lt;ref&gt;Irvin (2002), p. 164, ch. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Constantine backed the Nicene creed of Nicaea, but was baptized on his deathbed by the [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]], a bishop with Arian sympathies. His successor [[Constantius II]] supported Arian positions: under his rule, the [[Council of Constantinople (360)|Council of Constantinople in 360]] supported the Arian view. After the interlude of Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], who wanted to return to the pagan Roman/Greek religion, the west stuck to the Nicene creed, while Arianism or [[Semi-Arianism]] was dominant in the east (under Emperor Valens), until Emperor Theodosius I called the [[First Council of Constantinople|Council of Constantinople in 381]], which reasserted the Nicene view and rejected the Arian view. This council further refined the definition of orthodoxy, issuing the [[Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed]].

On 27 February of the previous year, Theodosius I established, with the [[Edict of Thessalonica]], the Christianity of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] as the official [[state religion]], reserving for its followers the title of Catholic Christians and declaring that those who did not follow the religion taught by [[Pope Damasus I]] of Rome and [[Pope Peter II of Alexandria|Pope Peter of Alexandria]] were to be called [[heresy|heretics]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Scowcroft Bettenson|title=Documents of the Christian Church|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k9L2UaDJLGkC&amp;pg=PA22|year=1967|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-501293-4|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is our desire that all the various nations which are subject to our Clemency and Moderation, should continue to profess that religion which was delivered to the Romans by the divine Apostle Peter, as it has been preserved by faithful tradition, and which is now professed by the Pontiff Damasus and by Peter, Bishop of Alexandria, a man of apostolic holiness. According to the apostolic teaching and the doctrine of the Gospel, let us believe in the one deity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, in equal majesty and in a holy Trinity. We authorize the followers of this law to assume the title of Catholic Christians; but as for the others, since, in our judgment they are foolish madmen, we decree that they shall be branded with the ignominious name of heretics, and shall not presume to give to their conventicles the name of churches. They will suffer in the first place the chastisement of the divine condemnation and in the second the punishment of our authority which in accordance with the will of Heaven we shall decide to inflict.|Edict of Thessalonica}}

In 391, Theodosius closed all the "pagan" (non-Christian and non-Jewish) temples and formally forbade pagan worship.

At the end of the 4th century the Roman Empire had effectively split into two parts although their economies and the Church were still strongly tied. The two halves of the Empire had always had cultural differences, exemplified in particular by the widespread use of the Greek language in the Eastern Empire and its more limited use in the West (Greek, as well as Latin, was used in the West, but Latin was the spoken [[vernacular]]).

By the time Christianity became the state religion of the Empire at the end of the 4th century, scholars in the West had largely abandoned Greek in favor of Latin. Even the Church in Rome, where Greek continued to be used in the [[liturgy]] longer than in the provinces, abandoned Greek.&lt;ref&gt;"The first Christians in Rome were chiefly people who came from the East and spoke Greek. The founding of Constantinople naturally drew such people thither rather than to Rome, and then Christianity at Rome began to spread among the Roman population, so that at last the bulk of the Christian population in Rome spoke Latin. Hence the change in the language of the liturgy. ... The liturgy was said (in Latin) first in one church and then in more, until the Greek liturgy was driven out, and the clergy ceased to know Greek. About 415 or 420 we find a Pope saying that he is unable to answer a letter from some Eastern bishops, because he has no one who could write Greek" (Alfred Plummer, Conversations with Dr. Döllinger 1870–1890, ed. Robrecht Boudens (Leuven University Press, 1985), p. 13).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate]] had begun to replace the [[Vetus Latina|older Latin translations]] of the Bible.

[[File:Hagia Sophia exterior 2007 002.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Hagia Sophia]] basilica in Constantinople, for centuries the largest church building in the world.]]

The [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th century]] would see further fracturing of the Church. Emperor [[Theodosius II|Theodosius&amp;nbsp;II]] called two synods in [[Ephesus]], one in 431 and one in 449, the [[First Council of Ephesus|first of which]] condemned the teachings of Patriarch [[Nestorius]] of Constantinople, while the second supported the teachings of [[Eutyches]] against [[Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name="Price 2005, p. 52"&gt;Price (2005), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Nestorius taught that Christ's divine and human nature were distinct persons, and hence [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] was the mother of Christ but not the mother of God. Eutyches taught on the contrary that there was in Christ only a single nature, different from that of human beings in general. The [[First Council of Ephesus]] rejected Nestorius' view, causing churches centered around the [[School of Edessa]], a city at the edge of the empire, to break with the imperial church (see [[Nestorian schism]]).&lt;ref name="Price 2005, p. 52"/&gt;

Persecuted within the Roman Empire, many Nestorians fled to [[Persia]] and joined the [[Sassanid]] Church (the future [[Church of the East]]). The [[Second Council of Ephesus]] upheld the view of Eutyches, but was overturned two years later by the [[Council of Chalcedon]], called by Emperor [[Marcian]]. Rejection of the Council of Chalcedon led to the exodus from the state church of the majority of Christians in Egypt and many in the Levant, who preferred [[miaphysitism|miaphysite]] theology.&lt;ref name="Price 2005, p. 52"/&gt;

Thus, within a century of the link established by Theodosius between the emperor and the church in his empire, it suffered a significant diminishment. Those who upheld the Council of Chalcedon became known in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] as [[Melkites]], the ''imperial'' group, followers of the ''emperor'' (in Syriac, ''malka'').&lt;ref&gt;Price (2005), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; This schism resulted in an independent communion of churches, including the Egyptian, Syrian, Ethiopian and Armenian churches, that is today known as [[Oriental Orthodoxy]].&lt;ref&gt;Bussell (1910), p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of these schisms, however, the Chalcedonian church still represented the majority of Christians within the by now already diminished Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Latourette (1975), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== End of the Western Roman Empire ====
[[File:Odoacer 480ad.jpg|thumb|450px|Odoacer's kingdom in 480, after annexing Dalmatia and most of Sicily.]]
In the 5th century, the Western Empire rapidly [[Decline of the Roman Empire|decayed]] and by the end of the century was no more. Within a few decades, [[Germanic tribes]], particularly the [[Goths]] and [[Vandals]], conquered the western provinces. Rome was sacked in [[Sack of Rome (410)|410]] and [[Sack of Rome (455)|455]], and was to be sacked again in the following century in [[Sack of Rome (546)|546]].&lt;ref name="Arian Churches"/&gt;

By 476 the Germanic chieftain [[Odoacer]] had conquered [[Italy]] and deposed the last western emperor, [[Romulus Augustus]], though he nominally submitted to the authority of Constantinople. The Arian Germanic tribes established their own systems of churches and bishops in the western provinces but were generally tolerant of the population who chose to remain in communion with the imperial church.&lt;ref name="Arian Churches"/&gt;

In 533 Roman Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]] in Constantinople launched a military campaign to reclaim the western provinces from the Arian Germans, starting with [[North Africa]] and proceeding to Italy. His success in recapturing much of the western Mediterranean was temporary. The empire soon lost most of these gains, but held Rome, as part of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]], until 751.

Justinian definitively established [[Caesaropapism]],&lt;ref name="Ayer 1913, p. 538"&gt;Ayer (1913), p. 538&lt;/ref&gt; believing "he had the right and duty of regulating by his laws the minutest details of worship and discipline, and also of dictating the theological opinions to be held in the Church".&lt;ref name="Ayer 1913, p. 553"&gt;Ayer (1913), p. 553&lt;/ref&gt; According to the entry in [[Liddell &amp; Scott]], the term ''[[orthodoxy|orthodox]]'' first occurs in the [[Codex Justinianus]]: "We direct that all Catholic churches, throughout the entire world, shall be placed under the control of the orthodox bishops who have embraced the Nicene Creed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/vitaphone1/history/justinianc.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022718/http://www.freewebs.com/vitaphone1/history/justinianc.html|url-status=dead|title=Code of Justinian I.5.21|archivedate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 6th century the Church within the Empire had become firmly tied with the imperial government,&lt;ref&gt;Cairns (1996), p. 124. "By 590 the church had not only been freed from persecution by the Roman state but had become closely linked with that state."&lt;/ref&gt; while in the west Christianity was mostly subject to the laws and customs of nations that owed no allegiance to the emperor.&lt;ref name="Ayer 1913, pp. 538-539"/&gt;

Rome never recognized this [[pentarchy]] of five sees as constituting the leadership of the church. It maintained that, in accordance with the First Council of Nicaea, only the three "[[Saint Peter|Petrine]]" sees of Rome, Alexandria and Antioch had a real patriarchal function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aezGH7vcWMEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA211|title=Readings in Church Authority: Gifts and Challenges for Contemporary Catholicism|first1=Richard|last1=Gaillardetz|first2=Kenneth|last2=Wilson|date=26 August 2003|publisher=Ashgate|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The canons of the [[Quinisext Council]] of 692, which gave ecclesiastical sanction to Justinian's decree, were also never fully accepted by the Western Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Quinisext-Council|title=Quinisext Council &amp;#124; Christianity|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim conquests of the territories of the patriarchates of Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem, most of whose Christians were in any case lost to the orthodox church since the aftermath of the Council of Chalcedon, left in effect only two patriarchates, those of Rome and Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qAlcKDsubMgC&amp;pg=PA73 Robert Browning, ''The Byzantine Empire''] (Revised Edition, CUA Press 1992 {{ISBN|978-0-81320754-4}}), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; In 732, Emperor [[Leo the Isaurian|Leo III]]'s [[Byzantine iconoclasm|iconoclast]] policies were resisted by [[Pope Gregory III]].

===Rise of Islam===
[[File:Age of Caliphs.png|thumb|350px|A map of Muslim expansion in the 7th and 8th centuries.]]
The [[Rashidun conquests]] began to expand the sway of [[Islam]] beyond [[Arabia]] in the 7th century, first [[Byzantine–Arab Wars|clashing with the Roman Empire]] in 634.
That empire and the Sassanid Persian Empire were at that time crippled by [[Byzantine–Sassanid War of 602–628|decades of war]] between them.
By the late 8th century the [[Umayyad caliphate]] had conquered all of [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Persia]] and much of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] territory including [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], [[Roman Palestine|Palestine]], and [[Roman Syria|Syria]].

Suddenly much of the Christian world was under Muslim rule. Over the coming centuries the successive Muslim states became some of the most powerful in the Mediterranean world.

Though the Byzantine church claimed religious authority over Christians in Egypt and the [[Levant]], in reality the majority of Christians in these regions were by then [[miaphysite]]s and members of other sects. The new Muslim rulers, in contrast, offered religious tolerance to Christians of all sects. Additionally subjects of the Muslim Empire could be accepted as Muslims simply by declaring a belief in a single deity and reverence for Muhammad (see [[shahada]]). As a result, the peoples of Egypt, Palestine and Syria largely accepted their new rulers and many declared themselves Muslims within a few generations. Muslim incursions later found success in parts of Europe, particularly Spain (see [[Al-Andalus]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cardini (2001), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion of Christianity in Europe===
[[File:Spread of Christianity to AD 600 (1).png|thumb|upright=1.5|The spread of Christianity in Europe by 325 AD (dark blue) and 600 AD (light blue).]]
During the [[Christianity in the 9th century|9th century]], the Emperor in Constantinople encouraged missionary expeditions to nearby nations including the Muslim caliphate, and the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Khazars]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} In 862 he sent Saints [[Cyril and Methodius]] to [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[Great Moravia]]. By then most of the Slavic population of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] was Christian and Tsar [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Boris I]] himself was baptized in 864. [[Serbia]] was accounted Christian by about 870.&lt;ref&gt;''The entry of the Slavs into Christendom'', p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; In early 867 Patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople]] wrote that Christianity was accepted by the [[Kievan Rus']], which however was definitively Christianized only at the close of the following century.

[[File:Droysens-23a.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The spread of Christianity in Europe by 1000.]]
Of these, the Church in Great Moravia chose immediately to link with Rome, not Constantinople: the missionaries sent there sided with the Pope during the [[Photian Schism]] (863–867).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Warren T. Treadgold|title=A History of the Byzantine State and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nYbnr5XVbzUC&amp;pg=PA453|year=1997|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-2630-6|pages=453, 558}}&lt;/ref&gt; After decisive victories over the Byzantines at [[Battle of Acheloos|Acheloos]] and [[Battle of Katasyrtai|Katasyrtai]], Bulgaria declared its Church autocephalous and elevated it to the rank of Patriarchate, an autonomy recognized in 927 by Constantinople,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLWqXrW2X-8C&amp;pg=PA15|title=The Ecumenical Patriarchate|first=Demetrius|last=Kiminas|date=1 March 2009|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jR98-Ata0CkC&amp;pg=PT274|title=Religion and Power in Europe: Conflict and Convergence|first=Joaquim|last=Carvalho|date=26 August 2007|publisher=Edizioni Plus|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; but abolished by Emperor [[Basil II]] Bulgaroktonos (the Bulgar-Slayer) after his 1018 conquest of Bulgaria.

In Serbia, which became an independent kingdom in the early 13th century, [[Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia|Stephen Uroš IV Dušan]], after conquering a large part of Byzantine territory in Europe and assuming the title of Tsar, raised the Serbian archbishop to the rank of patriarch in 1346, a rank maintained until after the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Turks. No Byzantine emperor ever ruled Russian Christianity.

Expansion of the Church in western and northern Europe began much earlier, with the conversion of the Irish in the [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th century]], the Franks at the end of the same century, the Arian Visigoths in Spain soon afterwards, and the English at the end of the [[Christianity in the 6th century|6th century]]. By [[Christianity in the 9th century|the time]] the Byzantine missions to central and eastern Europe began, Christian western Europe, in spite of losing most of Spain to Islam, encompassed Germany and part of Scandinavia, and, apart from the south of Italy, was independent of the Byzantine Empire and had been almost entirely so for centuries.

This situation fostered the idea of a universal church linked to no one particular state.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt; Long before the Byzantine Empire came to an end, [[Christianization of Poland|Poland]] also, [[History of Christianity in Hungary|Hungary]] and other central European peoples were part of a Church that in no way saw itself as the empire's church and that, with the [[East-West Schism]], had even ceased to be in communion with it.

In the East, the idea that the Byzantine emperor was the head of Christians everywhere persisted among churchmen as long as the empire existed, even when its actual territory was reduced to very little. In 1393, only 60 years before the fall of the capital, [[Patriarch Antony IV of Constantinople]] wrote to [[Basil I of Muscovy]] defending the liturgical commemoration in Russian churches of the Byzantine emperor on the grounds that he was "emperor (βασιλεύς) and autokrator of the Romans, that is ''of all Christians''".{{sfn|Meyendorff|1996|pp=89}} According to Patriarch Antony, "it is not possible among Christians to have a Church and not to have an emperor.

==Legacy==
[[File:Byzantine eagle.JPG|thumb|Emblem of the Patriarch of Constantinople, based on the imperial symbol adopted in the 11th century]]

Following the schism between the Eastern and Western Churches, various emperors sought at times but without success to reunite the Church, invoking the notion of Christian unity between East and West in an attempt to obtain assistance from the Pope and Western Europe against the Muslims who were gradually conquering the empire's territory. But the period of the Western [[Crusades]] against the Muslims had passed before even the first of the two reunion councils was held.

Even when persecuted by the emperor, the Eastern Church, [[George Pachymeres]] said, "counted the days until they should be rid not of their emperor (for they could no more live without an emperor than a body without a heart), but of their current misfortunes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald M. Nicol|title=The Last Centuries of Byzantium, 1261-1453|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2d6OHLqwEsC&amp;pg=PA78|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43991-6|pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church had come to merge psychologically in the minds of the Eastern bishops with the empire to such an extent that they had difficulty in thinking of Christianity without an emperor.&lt;ref name="Schadé 2006"/&gt;

In Western Europe, on the other hand, the idea of a universal church linked to the Emperor of Constantinople was replaced by that in which the Roman see was supreme.&lt;ref&gt;"It was the papacy also which kept alive in western Europe the ideal of a universal imperial Church, for the whole of western Christendom came to acknowledge the supremacy of the Roman see" Arthur Edward Romilly Boak, ''A History of Rome to 565 A.D.'', p. 4030.&lt;/ref&gt; "Membership in a universal church replaced citizenship in a universal empire. Across Europe, from Italy to Ireland, a new society centered on Christianity was forming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marvin Perry|author2=Myrna Chase|author3=James Jacob|author4=Margaret Jacob|author5=Theodore H.

The [[Western Church]] came to emphasize the term ''Catholic'' in its identity, an assertion of universality, while the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Church]] came to emphasize the term ''Orthodox'' in its identity, an assertion of holding to the true teachings of Jesus. Both churches claim to be the unique continuation of the previously united Chalcedonian Church, whose core doctrinal formulations have been retained also by many of the churches that emerged from the [[Protestant Reformation]], including [[Lutheranism]] and [[Anglicanism]].
