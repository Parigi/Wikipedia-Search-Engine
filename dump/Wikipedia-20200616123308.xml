'''John Sculley III''' (born April 6, 1939) is an American businessman, entrepreneur and investor in high-tech [[Startup company|startups]]. Sculley was vice-president (1970–1977) and president of [[PepsiCo]] (1977–1983), until he became [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of [[Apple Inc.]] on April 8, 1983, a position he held until leaving in 1993. In May 1987, Sculley was named [[Silicon Valley]]'s top-paid executive, with an annual salary of US$10.2 million.&lt;ref name="Infinite Loop"/&gt;{{rp|412}}

Sales at Apple increased from $800 million to $8 billion under Sculley's management, although many attribute his success to the fact that Sculley joined the company just when [[Steve Jobs|Steve Jobs's]] visions and [[Steve Wozniak|Steve Wozniak's]] creations had become highly lucrative.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/16/business/company-news-visionary-apple-chairman-moves-on.html?scp=8&amp;sq=john%20sculley%20apple&amp;st=cse "Company News – Visionary Apple Chairman Moves On"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909180416/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/16/business/company-news-visionary-apple-chairman-moves-on.html?scp=8&amp;sq=john%20sculley%20apple&amp;st=cse |date=September 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his stint at Apple remains controversial due to his departure from co-founder Steve Jobs's sales structure, particularly regarding Sculley's decision to compete with [[IBM]] in selling computers to the same types of customers.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/12/business/new-strategy-set-by-apple.html?scp=18&amp;sq=john%20sculley%20apple&amp;st=cse "New Strategy Set by Apple"]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305001600/http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/12/business/new-strategy-set-by-apple.html?scp=18&amp;sq=john%20sculley%20apple&amp;st=cse |date=March 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others say that the "two clashed over management styles and priorities, Jobs focusing on future innovation and Sculley more on current product lines and profitability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2013/03/18/ex-apple-ceo-john-sculley-believes-innovation-lull-will-end-smart-watch-likely-key-product-focus/ |title=Sculley quic bio at end of article |publisher="MacRumors |date=March 18, 2013 |accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Sculley ultimately was forced to step down as Apple CEO because he was opposed to licensing Macintosh software and was talking to [[Goldman Sachs]] about splitting Apple into two companies. When Sculley left in May 1993, Apple had $2 billion in cash and $200 million in debt.

Sculley is recognized as an expert in marketing, in part because of his early successes at PepsiCo, notably his introduction of the [[Pepsi Challenge]], which allowed the company to gain market share from primary rival [[Coca-Cola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|title=Steve Jobs|year=2011|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4516-4853-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/149 149]|url=https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/149}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used similar marketing strategies throughout the 1980s and 1990s at Apple to mass-market [[Macintosh]] personal computers, and today he continues to speak and write about disruptive marketing strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parisinnovationreview.com/articles-en/john-sculley-truly-disruptive-innovation|title=Rising to the challenge of truly disruptive innovation - Paris Innovation Review|website=parisinnovationreview.com|access-date=2019-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sculley is currently invested in and involved with a number of high-tech start-up companies, including 3CInteractive, XL Marketing (now rebranded as [[Zeta Interactive]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zetainteractive.com/company/press/241-january-2014.html |title=January 2014 |publisher=Zeta Interactive |accessdate=April 14, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415214751/http://www.zetainteractive.com/company/press/241-january-2014.html |archivedate=April 15, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inflexion Point, Mobeam, OpenPeak, x10 Credit, Pivot Acquisition Corp., nextSource and WorldMate.

[[Jeff Daniels]] portrayed Sculley in the film ''[[Steve Jobs (film)|Steve Jobs]]'', [[Matthew Modine]] portrayed him in the 2013 film ''[[Jobs (film)|Jobs]]'', and [[Allan Royal]] portrayed him in the 1999 TNT film ''[[Pirates of Silicon Valley]].''

==Early life and education==
Sculley was born in [[New York City]], the son of Margaret Blackburn (Smith), a [[horticulturist]], and John Sculley, Jr., a [[Wall Street]] [[lawyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/139/000026061/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 4, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825214308/http://www.nndb.com/people/139/000026061/ |archivedate=August 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1964/06/11/deaths.html?_r=0{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sculley and his brothers spent much of their childhood in Bermuda before moving back to New York. He attended high school at [[St. Mark's School (Massachusetts)|St. Mark's School]] in [[Southborough, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lowendmac.com/2006/growing-apple-with-the-macintosh-the-sculley-years Profile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408055749/http://lowendmac.com/2006/growing-apple-with-the-macintosh-the-sculley-years |date=April 8, 2016}}, lowendmac.com; accessed January 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sculley ultimately received a [[bachelor's degree]] in Architectural Design from [[Brown University]] and an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from the [[Wharton School]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/alumni/leadership|title=Wharton – Leadership Across Industries, High-Tech, John Sculley|publisher=Wharton.upenn.edu|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Sculley began work at Marschalk Co. in New York City in 1963.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===1967–82: Pepsi-Cola===
Sculley joined the Pepsi-Cola division of PepsiCo in 1967 as a trainee, where he participated in a six-month training program at a [[bottling plant]] in [[Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref name="Odyssey"&gt;{{cite book | first1=John | last1=Sculley | author-link1=John Sculley | first2=John A. | last2=Byrne | title=Odyssey: Pepsi to Apple ... A journey of adventure, ideas and the future | publisher=Diane Pub Co | ISBN= 0788169491 | oclc=947796756 | date=1990 | orig-year=October 1, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}} In 1970, at the age of 30, Sculley became the company's youngest marketing vice-president.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-08/news/mn-20471_1_john-sculley/2|title=Saga of Apple's Ex-Chief Takes an Unusual Turn :  Business: John Sculley quits as Spectrum chairman, alleging deceit.

Sculley initiated one of the company's first consumer-research studies, an extended in-home product test in which 350 families participated. As a result of the research, Pepsi decided to launch new, larger, and more varied packages of their soft drinks,&lt;ref name="Odyssey"/&gt;{{rp|43–44}} including the [[two-liter bottle]] Sculley worked with [[DuPont]] to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sculley |first=John |date=2014 |title=Moonshot! |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d8omDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT68 |publisher=RosettaBooks |page=68 |isbn=9780795343360}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Pepsi set out to dethrone Coca-Cola as the market leader of the industry, in what eventually became known as the [[Cola wars|Cola Wars]]. Pepsi began spending more on marketing and advertising, typically paying between US$200,000 and $300,000 for each television spot, while most companies spent between $15,000 and $75,000. With the Pepsi Generation campaign, Pepsi aimed to overturn Coca-Cola's classic marketing.&lt;ref name="Odyssey"/&gt;{{rp|54}}

In 1974, Sculley became president of PepsiCo's International Food Operations division&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, shortly after he visited a failing potato-chip factory in Paris. PepsiCo's food division was their only money-losing division, with revenues of US$83 million and losses of $156.5 million. To make the food division profitable, Sculley improved product quality, enhanced accounts, and established financial controls.&lt;ref name="Odyssey"/&gt;{{rp|63–66}} Within three years, the food division was making US$300 million in revenues and $40 million in profit.&lt;ref name="Odyssey"/&gt;{{rp|68}}

Sculley was best known at Pepsi for the [[Pepsi Challenge]], an advertising campaign he started in 1975 to compete against Coca-Cola to gain market share, using heavily advertised taste tests. It claimed based on Sculley's own research that Pepsi-Cola tasted better than Coca-Cola. The Pepsi Challenge included a series of television advertisements that first aired in the early 1970s, featuring lifelong Coca-Cola drinkers participating in [[blind taste test]]s. Pepsi's soft drink was always chosen as the preferred product by the participant; however, these tests have been criticized as being biased.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The Pepsi Challenge was mostly targeted at the Texas market, where Pepsi had a significantly lower [[market share]] at the time. The campaign was successful, significantly increasing Pepsi's market share in that state. At the time the Pepsi Challenge was started, Sculley was senior vice-president of United States sales and marketing operations at Pepsi.&lt;ref name="Odyssey"/&gt;{{rp|71–75}} Sculley himself took the taste test and picked Coke instead of Pepsi.&lt;ref name="Infinite Loop"/&gt;{{rp|287}}

In 1977, Sculley was named Pepsi's youngest-ever president. Although commonly called the CEO of Pepsi, this was never the case. At the time of his departure, [[Donald_M._Kendall|Don Kendall]] was CEO of Pepsi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/09/business/apple-gets-president-from-pepsi.html New York Times article:Apple gets President from Pepsi], April 9, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple lured Sculley away from Pepsi in order to apply his marketing skills to the personal computer market. [[Steve Jobs]] successfully sealed the deal after he made his legendary pitch to Sculley: "Do you want to sell sugared water for the rest of your life? Or do you want to come with me and change the world?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/nerds/part3.html |title=Triumph of the Nerds: The Transcripts, Part III |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple's president, [[Mike Markkula]], wanted to retire and believed that Jobs, who wished to be the company's president, lacked the discipline and temperament needed to run Apple on a daily basis. Sculley, with his solid business background and considerable recent success, would give Apple an image of greater reliability and stability. When Sculley started at Apple, he got a $1-million signing bonus, $1 million in annual pay and options on 350,000 shares of Apple.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From the time they first met in 1982 until 1985, Jobs and Sculley had what both acknowledged as an amazing partnership. Sculley used his marketing experience to help keep the aging [[Apple II]] generating much-needed cash and helped Jobs launch the Mac with the most admired consumer marketing campaign of its time. Once Jobs took over the [[Macintosh]] project from Apple co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]] and early Apple employee [[Jef Raskin]], he became the executive product manager and made all the product decisions.&lt;ref name=TheVerge&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Wozniak on Newton, Tesla, and why the original Macintosh was a 'lousy' product|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/27/4468314/steve-wozniak-on-how-the-newton-changed-his-life|accessdate=June 25, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312014832/http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/27/4468314/steve-wozniak-on-how-the-newton-changed-his-life|archivedate=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] computer, an innovative model designed by a team initially led by Jobs, became available in January 1983, and had disastrous sales. When Jobs's Macintosh, the first of a new series of models with a pioneering black-and-white [[graphical user interface]], was shipped to stores in January 1984, Sculley raised the initial price to $2,495 from the originally planned $1,995, allocating the additional money to hypothetically higher [[profit margin]]s and to expensive advertising campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Price_Fight.txt&amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&amp;detail=medium&amp;search=John%20Sculley |title=Andy Hertzfeld, Article: '&amp;#39;Price Fight'&amp;#39; (October 1983) |publisher=Folklore.org |accessdate=April 14, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415124834/http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Price_Fight.txt&amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&amp;detail=medium&amp;search=John%20Sculley |archivedate=April 15, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Macintosh sold well, and received excellent reviews, but it did not eliminate the [[IBM PC]]. Some of the privileges of Jobs's elite development groups were trimmed, and projects were subject to stricter review for usefulness, marketability, feasibility, and reasonable cost.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

At the peak of the Macintosh success, Apple made an attempt to move unsold inventory of Lisa computers by renaming it to "Macintosh XL" and positioning it as a top-of-the-line pro Macintosh model. At this point, a power struggle between Jobs and Sculley was becoming obvious. Jobs became "non-linear": he kept meetings running past midnight, sent out lengthy faxes, then called new meetings at 7:00 am.&lt;ref name="lemsculley"&gt;Hormby, Thomas. [http://lowendmac.com/2006/growing-apple-with-the-macintosh-the-sculley-years/ Growing Apple with the Macintosh: The Sculley years] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231124/http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/john-sculley-years-apple.html |date=March 25, 2014}}, ''Low End Mac,'' February 22, 2006.

Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple. Sculley found out about Jobs's plans and called a board meeting at which Apple's board of directors sided with Sculley and removed Jobs from his managerial duties. Jobs resigned from Apple and founded [[NeXT|NeXT Inc.]] the same year.&lt;ref name="lemsculley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Spector| first = G| title = Apple's Jobs Starts New Firm, Targets Education Market| work = [[PC Week]]| page = 109| date = September 24, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sculley said in 2015 that Jobs never forgave him and their friendship was never repaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/john-sculley-admits-steve-jobs-never-forgave-him-before-jobs-died-2015-5|title=Former Apple CEO John Sculley admits Steve Jobs never forgave him, and he never repaired their friendship, before Jobs died|work=Business Insider|date=May 27, 2015|accessdate=March 12, 2017|first=Jim|last=Edwards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Jobs left, Sculley was named president&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the company experienced a turnaround in 1986; one journalist wrote "since Sculley joined the company … many things have changed", and that his "strategy has worked".&lt;ref name="goyens19860419"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=S4s0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=X6gFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=919%2C5720872 | title=Sculley's strategy seems to be doing the job for Apple | work=Montreal Gazette | date=April 19, 1986 | accessdate=January 3, 2015 | author=Goyens, Chris | pages=J-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wozniak credited the Macintosh's initial success to Sculley, saying that he "worked to build a Macintosh market when the Apple II went away".&lt;ref name=TheVerge/&gt; Apple introduced a faster microprocessor and renamed "The Macintosh Office" to "Desktop Publishing."{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Under the direction of Sculley, who had learned several painful lessons after introducing the bulky [[Macintosh Portable]] in 1989, Apple introduced the [[PowerBook]] in 1991. The same year, Apple introduced [[System 7]], a major upgrade to the operating system, which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. It remained the architectural basis for Mac OS until 2001, when the [[classic Mac OS]] was replaced by [[Mac OS X]]. The success of the PowerBook and other products brought increasing revenue. For some time, it appeared that Apple could do no wrong, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine ''[[MacLife|MacAddict]]'' named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the "first golden age" of the Macintosh.&lt;ref name="lemsculley"/&gt; Under the leadership of Sculley, Apple's sales multiplied from $982 million in 1983 to $7.9 billion in 1993.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Microsoft]] threatened to discontinue [[Microsoft Office]] for the Macintosh if Apple did not license parts of the Macintosh graphical user interface to use in the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system. Under pressure, Sculley agreed, a decision which later affected the ''[[Apple v. Microsoft]]'' lawsuit. About that time, Sculley coined the term [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA) referring to the [[Apple Newton]], one of the world's first PDAs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciber.com/ciber/30years/more.cfm?dataid=174&amp;id=90 Ciber, Technology Milestone: Apple Newton 1993] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050206160039/http://www.ciber.com/ciber/30years/more.cfm?dataid=174&amp;id=90 |date=February 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Sculley made several predictions in a ''[[Playboy]]'' interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/137462/article-1G1-5079227/john-sculley |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011220920/http://business.highbeam.com/137462/article-1G1-5079227/john-sculley |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 11, 2012 |title=Playboy &amp;#124; September 1, 1987 &amp;#124; Goodman, Danny &amp;#124; Copyright 2002 Playboy |publisher=Business.highbeam.com |date=September 1, 1987 |accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He predicted that the [[Soviet Union]] would land a man on [[Mars]] within the next 20 years and claimed that optical storage media such as the [[CD-ROM]] would revolutionize the use of personal computers. Some of his ideas for the [[Knowledge Navigator]] were eventually fulfilled by the Internet and the [[World Wide Web]] during the 1990s and others by Apple itself with the introduction of [[Siri (software)|Siri]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

On December 5, 1992, Sculley, as Chairman, CEO, and CTO of Apple Computer, Inc., gave a seminal speech regarding the future of the Internet, titled "The Dawn of a $3.5 Trillion Communications Mega-Industry: Information Access, Processing and Distribution in a Digital World." This was the keynote address to a packed house at the Harvard Business School's Burden Auditorium, as part of the inaugural student-run Harvard/MIT Communications 2000 Symposium (now known as the Harvard Business School Tech Club's annual [[Cyberposium]]).

In the early 1990s, Sculley led Apple to [[porting|port]] its operating system to run on a new microprocessor, the [[PowerPC]]. Sculley later acknowledged such an act was his greatest mistake, indicating that he should instead have targeted the dominant [[Intel]] architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=7045 |title=MacWorld, '&amp;#39;John Sculley Admits Intel Blunder'&amp;#39; (2003) |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=April 14, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022230413/http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?newsid=7045 |archivedate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a bad first quarter in 1993, amid a personal-computer price war and internal tension over the company's direction, Apple's board forced Sculley out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16538745|title=Ex-Apple boss Sculley sets record straight on Jobs|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned on October 15, 1993&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune'': [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-10-15/news/9310160132_1_john-sculley-steven-jobs-resignation "Apple's John Sculley Resigns Chairmanship For `New Challenges'"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309070905/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-10-15/news/9310160132_1_john-sculley-steven-jobs-resignation |date=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was replaced by [[Germans|German]]-born [[Michael Spindler]], who had been Chief Operating Officer. Spindler was ousted three years later.&lt;ref&gt;''The Independent'': [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/spindler-finally-ousted-from-apple-1317052.html "Spindler 'finally ousted' from Apple"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502181024/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/spindler-finally-ousted-from-apple-1317052.html |date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1993–present: Tech-investing===
After leaving Apple on October 23, 1993, Sculley became chairman and chief executive officer at Spectrum Information Technologies, a New York-based company that held key computer patents for wireless data transmission. Only four months later he resigned from the company and filed a lawsuit against Spectrum president Peter Caserta, seeking more than $10 million in damages. Sculley alleged that he was misled when he was hired at Spectrum by not being told of SEC inquiries and "aggressive revenue recognition accounting" for license fees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sculley has been a founding investor in [[MetroPCS]] (formerly General Wireless) and helped guide the company's brand marketing; MetroPCS became a multibillion-dollar public company on the New York Stock Exchange&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stocktwits.com/symbol/PCS|title=PCS investment information - MetroPCS Communications, Inc. ideas on StockTwits|first=StockTwits Inc|last=(stocktwits.com)|website=StockTwits|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; until its acquisition by T-Mobile in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/1/4286622/t-mobile-us-metropcs-merger-complete-tmus |title=- T-Mobile and MetroPCS merger finalized, company to begin trading as 'T-Mobile US'| publisher=verge.com |date=May 1, 2013 |accessdate=June 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He built NFO Research from $25 million to $550 million in revenue, and sold it to [[The Interpublic Group of Companies|IPG]] for $850 million. He helped launch and advised [[Hotwire.com]], [[IntraLinks|Intralinks]] (which was co-founded by his brother Arthur), and [[InPhonic]], [[Buy.com]], and [[PeoplePC]]—each of which became billion dollar market cap public companies in the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In 1997, Sculley became the chairman of Live Picture, a California-based company, to oversee its push into high-quality, low-bandwidth imaging over the Internet. US$22M in venture capital was provided for the company. Sculley later left the company, but remained an investor. In 1999, Live Picture filed for federal bankruptcy protection as part of a plan to be acquired by MGI Software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--Start Byline--&gt;&lt;!--End Byline--&gt; |url=http://money.cnn.com/1997/09/11/technology/sculley_intv/ |title=CNNMoney, '&amp;#39;John Sculley rides again'&amp;#39;, September 1997 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.next.advocacy/browse_thread/thread/bfe4aab657b25cb0/b4da3428703cb9d3?lnk=st&amp;q=Live+Picture+Inc+Bankrupt&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#b4da3428703cb9d3 |title=Google Groups, '&amp;#39;Live Picture files for bankruptcy'&amp;#39;, May 1999 |publisher=Groups.google.com |date= |accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Sculley co-founded PopTech with [[Robert Metcalfe|Bob Metcalfe]] and several other dignitaries from the technology industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/the-daily-need/celebrating-failure-and-other-novelties-at-pop-tech/4396/ |title=All roads lead to Camden &amp;#124; Need to Know |publisher=Pbs.org |date=October 21, 2010 |accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, he joined the board of directors of [[Buy.com|BuyComp LLC]] (now Buy.com), an Internet-only computer store. Two years later, he partnered with [[Dennis M. Lynch]] to launch Signature21, providing marketing services to small to medium-sized businesses. In 2001, Sculley and Lynch transitioned the company into a learning program for rising entrepreneurs. Months later, Lynch left the company, while Sculley continued to consult and work with small businesses, including [[InPhonic]], whose board of directors he later joined. InPhonic was an online retailer of cell phones and wireless plans. Sculley's early leadership&lt;ref&gt;[http://wbt.sys-con.com/read/40825.htm Robert Diamond, ''When two heads are better than one''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021441/http://wbt.sys-con.com/read/40825.htm |date=September 28, 2007}}, May 2, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; helped steer InPhonic towards its successful IPO in 2004. Sculley served as the vice chairman of the InPhonic board of directors. InPhonic filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|bankcruptcy]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corp.inphonic.com/reorg/ |title=InPhonic.com Press Release, November 8, 2007 |accessdate=January 9, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504210840/http://corp.inphonic.com/reorg/ |archivedate=May 4, 2008 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Sculley endorsed and invested in the [[Wine Clip]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewineclip.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?category=tech_pvr |title=The Wine Clip Testimonials |publisher=Thewineclip.com |date=November 20, 2003 |accessdate=April 14, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415103725/http://www.thewineclip.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?category=tech_pvr |archivedate=April 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a wine accessory product, which claims to accelerate the aeration of wine by exposure to magnets.

Before speaking at the Silicon Valley 4.0 conference, Sculley was interviewed by [[CNET.com|CNET]] in October 2003, where he explained the mistakes he made at Apple concerning the [[Apple Newton]] and [[HyperCard]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120205201219/http://news.cnet.com/2008-7351-5085423.html Dawn Kawamoto, ''Riding the next technology wave''], October 2, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Sculley had cancelled Apple's first hand-held mobile tablet PenMac led by Paul Mercer with applications by [[Samir Arora]] and instead signed an agreement to work with Sharp Electronics on the Newton technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/27/technology/27mercer.html|title=He Helped Build the iPod; Now He Has Built a Rival|last=Markoff|first=John|date=February 27, 2006|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/27/exclusive-picture-of-unlaunched-apple-tablet-circa-1990/|title=Exclusive Picture Of Unlaunched Apple Tablet (circa 1990)|last=Arrington|first=Michael|website=TechCrunch|access-date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2003, Sculley was interviewed by the [[BBC]] for the television documentary ''The World's Most Powerful'' episode ''Steve Jobs vs. [[Bill Gates]]'', discussing his time at Apple during the 1980s as CEO.

In 2007, Sculley co-founded the data company [[Zeta Global]] with business partner [[David A.
