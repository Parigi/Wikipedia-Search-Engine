[[Image:Frog diamagnetic levitation.jpg|thumb|The 2000 Ig Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to [[Andre Geim]], [[Radboud University Nijmegen]], and [[Michael Berry (physicist)|Michael Berry]], [[University of Bristol]], UK, for the [[magnetic levitation]] of a live frog. Geim was awarded an actual Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.improbable.com/2010/10/05/geim-becomes-first-nobel-ig-nobel-winner/ |title=Geim becomes first Nobel &amp; Ig Nobel winner |publisher=Improbable.com |date=October 5, 2010 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''Ig Nobel Prize''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɪ|ɡ|n|oʊ|ˈ|b|ɛ|l}} {{respell|IG|noh|BEL|'}}) is a [[satire|satiric]] prize awarded annually since 1991 to celebrate ten unusual or trivial achievements in scientific research, its stated aim being to "honor achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think." The name of the award is a pun on the [[Nobel Prize]], which it parodies, and the word ''[[wikt:ignoble|ignoble]]''.

Organized by the scientific humor magazine ''[[Annals of Improbable Research]]'' (AIR), the Ig Nobel Prizes are presented by [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureates]] in a ceremony at the [[Memorial Hall (Harvard University)|Sanders Theater]], Harvard University, and are followed by the winners’ public lectures at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://slate.com/technology/2012/09/ig-nobel-prize-2012-improbable-research-presented-in-sept-20-ceremony-and-this-is-improbable-book.html |title=The Greatest Hits of Weird Science: What the Oscars could learn from the Ig Nobel Prize ceremony |author-link=Marc Abrahams |first=Marc |last=Abrahams |date=September 12, 2012 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]] |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Ig Nobels were created in 1991 by [[Marc Abrahams]], editor and co-founder of the ''[[Annals of Improbable Research]]'', a former editor-in-chief of the ''[[Journal of Irreproducible Results]]'' who has been master of ceremonies at all awards ceremonies. Awards were presented at that time for discoveries "that cannot, or should not, be reproduced". Ten prizes are awarded each year in many categories, including the Nobel Prize categories of physics, chemistry, physiology/medicine, literature, and peace, but also other categories such as public health, engineering, biology, and interdisciplinary research. The Ig Nobel Prizes recognize genuine achievements, with the exception of three prizes awarded in the first year to fictitious scientists [[Josiah S. Carberry]], [[Paul DeFanti]], and [[Administratium|Thomas Kyle]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

The awards are sometimes criticism via satire, as in the two awards given for [[homeopathy]] research, prizes in "science education" to the [[Kansas State Department of Education]] and [[Colorado State Board of Education]] for their [[Kansas evolution hearings|stance]] regarding the [[Creation and evolution in public education|teaching of evolution]], and the prize awarded to ''[[Social Text]]'' after the [[Sokal affair]]. Most often, however, they draw attention to [[scientific articles]] that have some humorous or unexpected aspect. Examples range from the discovery that the presence of humans tends to sexually arouse [[ostrich]]es, to the statement that [[black hole]]s fulfill all the technical requirements for being the location of Hell, to research on the "[[five-second rule]]", a tongue-in-cheek belief that food dropped on the floor will not become contaminated if it is picked up within five seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://improbable.com/ig/ig-pastwinners.html Improbable.com Ig Nobel Past Winners]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[Andre Geim]], who had been awarded an Ig Nobel Prize in 2000 for levitating a frog by magnetism, was awarded a Nobel Prize in physics in 2010 for his work with the electromagnetic properties of [[graphene]].  He is the only individual, as of 2020, to have received both a Nobel and an Ig Nobel.&lt;ref name="Overbye_NYT"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |title=Physics Nobel Honors Work on Ultra-Thin Carbon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/science/06nobel.html |access-date=November 17, 2018 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ceremony ==
The prizes are mostly presented by [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureates]], originally at a ceremony in a lecture hall at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], but now in the [[Memorial Hall (Harvard University)|Sanders Theater]] at [[Harvard University]]. The event contains a number of running jokes, including Miss Sweetie Poo, a little girl who repeatedly cries out, "Please stop: I'm bored", in a high-pitched voice if speakers go on too long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kees |last=Moeliker |author-link=Kees Moeliker |title=Infinity and so much more |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/oct/11/highereducation.research1 |publisher=Education.guardian.co.uk |date=October 11, 2005 |access-date=November 17, 2018 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards ceremony is traditionally closed with the words: "If you didn't win a prize—and especially if you did—better luck next year!"

The ceremony is co-sponsored by the Harvard Computer Society, the [[Harvard–Radcliffe Science Fiction Association]] and the Harvard–Radcliffe Society of Physics Students.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.improbable.com/ig-about/ Improbable.com: "About the Ig Nobel prize"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throwing [[paper plane]]s onto the stage is a long-standing tradition. For many years Professor [[Roy J. Glauber]] swept the stage clean of the airplanes as the official "Keeper of the Broom." Glauber could not attend the 2005 awards because he was traveling to Stockholm to claim a genuine [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.improbable.com/2018/12/27/sad-news-roy-glauber-paper-airplane-sweeper-and-physicist-of-light-is-gone/ Improbable.com: "Roy Glauber, paper airplane sweeper, is gone"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Parade of Ignitaries" into the hall includes supporting groups. At the 1997 ceremonies, a team of "cryogenic sex researchers" distributed a pamphlet titled "Safe Sex at [[Liquid helium|Four Kelvin]]." Delegates from the [[Museum of Bad Art]] are often on hand to display some pieces from their collection.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

== Outreach ==
The ceremony is recorded and broadcast on [[NPR|National Public Radio]] in the US and is shown live over the Internet. The recording is broadcast every year, on the Friday after U.S. [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], on the public radio program ''[[Science Friday]]''. In recognition of this, the audience chants the name of the radio show's host, [[Ira Flatow]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Two books have been published with write-ups on some winners: ''The Ig Nobel Prize'',&lt;ref&gt;2002, US paperback {{ISBN|0-452-28573-9}}, UK paperback {{ISBN|0-7528-4261-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Ig Nobel Prize 2''&lt;ref&gt;2005, US hardcover {{ISBN|0-525-94912-7}}, UK hardcover {{ISBN|0-7528-6461-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later retitled ''The Man Who Tried to Clone Himself''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=9780452287723 |title=The Man Who Tried to Clone Himself |first=Marc |last=Abrahams |publisher=Plume |year=2006 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/manwhotriedtoclo0000abra }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Ig Nobel Tour has been an annual part of National Science week in the United Kingdom since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.improbable.com/navstrip/airshows/info/Ig-Nobel_UK_hosting_info.pdf |title=The Ig Nobel Tour of the UK |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour has also traveled to Australia several times, [[Aarhus University]] in Denmark in April 2009, Italy and The Netherlands.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

== Reception ==
A September 2009 article in ''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]'' titled "A noble side to Ig Nobels" says that, although the Ig Nobel Awards are veiled criticism of trivial research, history shows that trivial research sometimes leads to important breakthroughs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Robert |last=Matthews |url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/science/a-noble-side-to-ig-nobels-1.532698 |title=A Noble Side to Ig Nobels |website=The National |date=September 27, 2009 |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in 2006, a study showing that one of the malaria [[mosquito]]es (''[[Anopheles gambiae]]'') is attracted equally to the smell of [[Limburger|Limburger cheese]] and the smell of human feet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bart |last=Knols |title=On human odour, malaria mosquitoes, and Limburger cheese |journal=Lancet |volume=348 |issue=9037 |page=1322 |date=November 9, 1996 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)65812-6 |pmid=8909415 |url=https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(05)65812-6.pdf |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; earned the Ig Nobel Prize in the area of biology. As a direct result of these findings, traps baited with this cheese have been placed in strategic locations in some parts of Africa to combat the epidemic of malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.improbable.com/ig/ig-pastwinners.html#ig2006 |title=The 2006 Ig Nobel Prize Winners |publisher=Improbable.com |access-date=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Parasitology Today |volume=12 |issue=4 |date=April 1996 |pages=159–161 |title=Limburger cheese as an attractant for the malaria mosquito ''Anopheles gambiae s.s.'' |first1=Brad |last1=Knols |first2=Ruurd |last2=De Jong |doi=10.1016/0169-4758(96)10002-8 |pmid=15275226 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
