'''Tuscan''' ({{lang-it|dialetto toscano}} {{IPA-it|djaˈlɛtto toˈskaːno; di.a-|}}; {{lang-it|vernacolo|label=locally}}) is a set of [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of [[Romance languages|Romance]] mainly spoken in [[Tuscany]], Italy.

[[Italian language|Standard Italian]] is based on Tuscan, specifically on its [[Florentine dialect]], and it became the language of culture throughout Italy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it//enciclopedia/storia-della-lingua_(Enciclopedia-dell%27Italiano)|title=storia della lingua in "Enciclopedia dell'Italiano"|website=www.treccani.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the prestige of the works by [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Petrarch]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], and [[Francesco Guicciardini]]. It would later become the official language of all the [[List of historic states of Italy|Italian states]] and of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] when it was formed.

In "De vulgari eloquentia" ({{circa}} 1300), [[Dante Alighieri]] distinguishes four main subdialects: [[Florentine dialect|''fiorentino'']] ([[Florence]]), ''senese'' ([[Siena]]), ''lucchese'' ([[Lucca]]) and ''aretino'' ([[Arezzo]]).

Tuscan is a dialect complex composed of many local variants, with minor differences among them.

The main subdivisions are between Northern Tuscan dialects, the Southern Tuscan dialects, and Corsican.

The Northern Tuscan dialects are (from east to west):
* [[Florentine dialect|Fiorentino]], the main dialect of [[Florence]], [[Chianti]] and the [[Mugello region]], also spoken in [[Prato]] and along the river [[Arno]] as far as the city of  [[Fucecchio]].
* Pistoiese, spoken in the city of [[Pistoia]] and nearest zones (some linguists include this dialect in ''Fiorentino'').
* Pesciatino or Valdinievolese, spoken in the [[Valdinievole]] zone, in the cities of [[Pescia]] and [[Montecatini Terme]] (some linguists include this dialect in ''Lucchese'').
* Lucchese, spoken in [[Lucca]] and nearby hills (''Lucchesia'').
* Versiliese, spoken in the historical area of [[Versilia]].
* Viareggino, spoken in [[Viareggio]] and vicinity.
* Pisano-Livornese, spoken in [[Pisa]], in [[Livorno]], and the vicinity, and along the coast from Livorno to [[Cecina, Tuscany|Cecina]].

The Southern Tuscan dialects are (from east to west):
* Aretino-Chianaiolo, spoken in [[Arezzo]] and the [[Valdichiana]].
* Senese, spoken in the city and province of [[Siena]].
* Grossetano, spoken in [[Grosseto]] and along the southern coast.
* Elbano, spoken on the island of Elba.

[[Corsican language|Corsican]] on the island of [[Corsica]] and the Corso-Sardinian transitional varieties spoken in northern [[Sardinia]] ([[Gallurese dialect|Gallurese]] and [[Sassarese dialect|Sassarese]]) are classified by scholars as a direct offshoot from medieval Tuscan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Romance Languages|first=Martin |last= Harris|first2= Nigel|last2= Vincent|year= 1997|isbn=0-415-16417-6|publisher=Routlegde|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though they now constitute a distinct linguistic group.

==Speakers==
Excluding the inhabitants of [[Province of Massa and Carrara]], who speak an [[Emilian dialect|Emilian variety]] of a [[Gallo-Italic languages|Gallo-Italic language]], around 3,500,000 people speak the Tuscan dialect.

==Dialectal features==
The Tuscan dialect as a whole has certain defining features, with subdialects that are distinguished by minor details.

===Phonetics===

====Tuscan gorgia====
The [[Tuscan gorgia]] affects the [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] [[stop consonant]]s {{IPA|/k/}} {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/p/}}. They are often pronounced as [[fricative consonant|fricatives]] in post-vocalic position when not blocked by the competing phenomenon of [[syntactic gemination]]:
* {{IPA|/k/}} → {{IPAblink|h}}
* {{IPA|/t/}} → {{IPAblink|θ}}
* {{IPA|/p/}} → {{IPAblink|ɸ}}

====Weakening of G and C====
A phonetic phenomenon is the intervocalic weakening of the Italian ''soft g'', the voiced affricate {{IPA|/dʒ/}} (''g'' as in '''''j'''ud'''g'''e'') and ''soft c'', the voiceless affricate {{IPA|/tʃ/}} (''ch'' as in '''''ch'''ur'''ch'''''), known as ''attenuation'', or, more commonly, as [[deaffrication]].

Between vowels, the ''voiced post-alveolar affricate'' consonant is realized as ''voiced post-alveolar fricative'' (''z'' of a'''z'''ure):

&lt;center&gt;{{IPAslink|dʒ}} → {{IPAblink|ʒ}}.&lt;/center&gt;

This phenomenon is very evident in daily speech (common also in [[Umbria]] and elsewhere in Central Italy): the phrase ''la gente'', 'the people', in standard Italian is pronounced {{IPA-it|la ˈdʒɛnte|}}, but in Tuscan it is {{IPA-itdia|la ˈʒɛnte|}}.

Similarly, the ''voiceless post-alveolar affricate'' is pronounced as a ''voiceless post-alveolar fricative'' between two vowels:

&lt;center&gt;{{IPAslink|tʃ}} → {{IPAblink|ʃ}}.&lt;/center&gt;

The sequence {{IPA|/la ˈtʃena/}} ''la cena'', 'the dinner', in standard Italian is pronounced {{IPA-it|la ˈtʃeːna|}}, but in Tuscan it is {{IPA-itdia|la ˈʃeːna|}}. As a result of this weakening rule, there are a few minimal pairs distinguished only by length of the voiceless fricative (e.g. {{IPA-itdia|laʃeˈrɔ|}} ''lacerò'' 'it/he/she ripped' vs. {{IPA-itdia|laʃʃeˈrɔ|}} ''lascerò'' 'I will leave/let').

====Affrication of S====
A less common phonetic phenomenon is the realization of "voiceless s" ([[voiceless alveolar fricative]] {{IPA|/s/}}) as the [[voiceless alveolar affricate]] {{IPA|[ts]}} when preceded by {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, or {{IPA|/n/}}.

&lt;center&gt;{{IPA|/s/}} → {{IPA|[ts]}}.&lt;/center&gt;

For example, ''il sole'' (the sun), pronounced in standard Italian as {{IPA-it|il ˈsoːle|}}, would be in theory pronounced by a Tuscan speaker {{IPA-itdia|il ˈtsoːle|}}. However, since assimilation of the final consonant of the article to the following consonant tends to occur in exactly such cases (see "Masculine definite articles" below) the actual pronunciation will be usually {{IPA-itdia|is ˈsoːle|}}. Affrication of {{IPA|/s/}} can more commonly be heard word-internally, as in ''falso'' (false) {{IPA|/ˈfalso/}} → {{IPA-itdia|ˈfaltso|}}. This is a common phenomenon in Central Italy, but it is not exclusive to that area; for example it also happens in [[Switzerland]] ([[Canton Ticino]]).

====No dipththongization of {{IPA|/ɔ/}}====
There are two Tuscan historical outcomes of Latin ''ŏ'' in stressed open syllables. Passing first through a stage {{IPAslink|ɔ}}, the vowel then develops as a diphthong {{IPA|[wɔ]}}. This phenomenon never gained universal acceptance, however, so that while forms with the diphthong came to be accepted as standard Italian (e.g. ''fuoco'', ''buono'', ''nuovo''), the monophthong remains in popular speech (''foco'', ''bono'', ''novo'').

===Morphology===

====Accusative "te" for "tu"====

A characteristic of Tuscan dialect is the use of the accusative pronoun ''te'' in emphatic clauses of the type "You! What are you doing here?".
* Standard Italian: '''''tu''' lo farai, no?'' ''''You''''ll do it, won't you?'
* Tuscan: '''''Te''' lo farai, no?''
* Standard Italian: '''''tu''', vieni qua!'' ''''You''', come here!'
* Tuscan: '''''Te''', vieni qua!''

====Double dative pronoun====
A morphological phenomenon, cited also by [[Alessandro Manzoni]] in his masterpiece "''I promessi sposi''" (The Betrothed), is the '''doubling of the dative pronoun'''.

For the use of a personal pronoun as ''indirect object'' (''to someone, to something''), also called ''[[dative case]]'', the standard Italian makes use of a construction ''preposition + pronoun'' '''a me''' (to me), or it makes use of a synthetic pronoun form, '''mi''' (to me). The Tuscan dialect makes use of both in the same sentence as a kind of intensification{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} of the dative/indirect object:
* In Standard Italian: ''a me piace'' or ''mi piace'' ("I like it"; literally, "it pleases me")
* In Tuscan: ''a me mi piace'' ("I like it")

This usage is widespread throughout the central regions of Italy, not only in Tuscany, and is often considered redundant and erroneous by language purists.

In some dialects the '''double accusative pronoun''' ''me mi vedi'' (lit: ''You see me me'') can be heard,  but it is considered an archaic form.

====Masculine definite articles====

The singular and plural masculine definite articles can both be realized phonetically as {{IPA|[i]}} in Florentine varieties of Tuscan, but are distinguished by their phonological effect on following consonants. The singular provokes lengthening of the following consonant: {{IPA|[i kkaːne]}} 'the dog', whereas the plural permits consonant weakening: {{IPA|[i haːni]}} 'the dogs'. As in Italian, masc. sing.  ''lo'' occurs before consonants long by nature or not permitting {{IPA|/l/}} in clusters is normal (''lo zio'' 'the uncle', ''lo studente'' 'the student'), although forms such as ''i zio'' can be heard in rustic varieties.

====Noi + impersonal ''si''====
A morpholosyntactic phenomenon found throughout Tuscany is the personal use of the particle identical to '''impersonal si''' (not to be confused with ''passive si'' or the ''reflexive si''), as the first person plural. It is basically the same as the use of ''on'' in [[French language|French]].

It's possible to use the construction '''''si''''' + '''''Third person in singular''''', which can be preceded by the first plural person pronoun '''''noi'''''. 
* Standard Italian: ''Andiamo a mangiare'' (We're going to eat), ''Noi andiamo là'' (We go there)
* Tuscan: ''Si va a mangià'' (We're going to eat), ''Noi si va là'' (We go there)

The phenomenon is found in all verb tenses, including compound tenses. In these tenses, the use of ''si'' requires a form of '''essere''' (''to be'') as auxiliary verb. If the verb is one that otherwise selects auxiliary '''avere''' in compound constructions, the past participle does not agree with the subject in gender and number:
* Italian: ''Abbiamo mangiato al ristorante.''
* Tuscan: ''S'è mangiato al ristorante.''
If the verb normally requires ''essere'', the past participle is marked as plural:
* Italian: ''Siamo andati al cinema.''
* Tuscan: ''S'è andati al cinema.''

Usually ''si'' contracts before '''è''': ''si è → s'è''.

====Fo (faccio) and vo (vado)====
Another morphological phenomenon in the Tuscan dialect is what might appear to be '''shortening''' of first singular verb forms in the present tense of '''''fare''''' (''to do'', ''to make'')  and '''''andare''''' (''to go'').
* Fare: It. ''faccio''  Tusc. '''fo''' (I do, I make)
* Andare: It. ''vado''  Tusc. '''vo''' (I go)

These forms have two origins. Natural phonological change alone can account for loss of {{IPA|/d/}} and reduction of {{IPA|/ao/}} to {{IPA|/o/}} in the case of {{IPA|/vado/}} &gt; *{{IPA|/vao/}} &gt; {{IPA|/vo/}}. A case such as Latin: ''sapio'' &gt; Italian '''so''' (I know), however, admits no such phonological account: the expected outcome of {{IPA|/sapio/}} would be *{{IPA|/sappjo/}}, with a normal lengthening of the consonant preceding yod.

What seems to have taken place is a realignment of the paradigm in accordance with the statistically minor but highly frequent paradigms of ''dare'' (give) and ''stare'' (be, stay). Thus ''so, sai, sa, sanno'' (all singulars and 3rd personal plural of 'know') come to fit the template of ''do, dai, dà, danno'' ('give'), ''sto, stai, sta, stanno'' ('be, stay'), and ''fo, fai, fa, fanno'' ('make, do') follows the same pattern. The form '''vo''', while quite possibly a natural phonological development, seems to have been reinforced by analogy in this case.

====Loss of infinitival "-re" {{anchor|Loss_of_infinitival_.22-re.22}}====
A phonological phenomenon that might appear to be a morphological one is the loss of the infinitival ending '''-re''' of verbs.
* ''andàre'' → '''andà'''
* ''pèrdere'' → '''pèrde'''
* ''finìre'' → '''finì'''

Stress remains on the same vowel that is stressed in the full form, so that the infinitive can come to coincide with various conjugated singulars: ''pèrde'' 'to lose', ''pèrde'' 's/he loses'; ''finì'' 'to finish', ''finì'' 's/he finished'. This homophony seldom, if ever, causes confusion, as they usually appear in distinct syntactic contexts. 

While the infinitive without ''-re'' is universal in some subtypes such as Pisano-Livornese, in the vicinity of [[Florence]] alternations are regular, so that the full infinitive (e.g. ''vedere'' 'to see') appears when followed by a [[pausa|pause]], and the clipped form (''vedé'') is found when phrase internal. The consonant of enclitics is lengthened if preceded by stressed vowel (''vedéllo'' 'to see it', ''portàcci'' 'to bring us'), but not when the preceding vowel of the infinitive is unstressed (''lèggelo'' 'to read it', ''pèrdeti'' 'to lose you').

A similar process is found in Catalan and its dialects. Final infinitive -r is not pronounced, so ''anar'' is realised as /ə'na/.

===Lexicon===
{{multiple issues|section=yes|{{original research|section|date=September 2014}}{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2014}}}}
The biggest differences among dialects is in the [[lexicon]], which also distinguishes the different subdialects.
The Tuscan lexicon is almost entirely shared with standard Italian, but many words may be perceived as obsolete or literary by non-Tuscans. There are a number of strictly regional words and expressions too.

Characteristically Tuscan words:
&lt;!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER --&gt;
* '''accomodare''' (which means "to arrange" in standard Italian) for ''riparare'' (to repair)
* '''babbo''' (standard form in Italian before the French loanword ''papa'') for ''papà'' (dad)
* '''bove''' (literary form in standard Italian) for ''bue'' (ox)
* '''cacio''' for ''formaggio'' (cheese), especially for Pecorino
* '''calzoni'''  (literary form in standard Italian) for ''pantaloni''
* '''camiciola''' for ''canottiera'' (undervest)
* '''cannella''' (literary form in standard Italian) for ''rubinetto'' (tap)
* '''capo''' (literary form in standard Italian) and '''chiorba''' for ''testa'' (head)
* '''cencio''' for ''straccio'' (rag, tatters) (but also ''straccio'' is widely used in Tuscany)
* '''chetarsi''' (literary form in standard Italian) for ''fare silenzio'' (to be silent)
* '''codesto''' (literary form in standard Italian) is a pronoun which specifically identifies an object far from the speaker, but near the listener (corresponding in meaning to Latin ''iste'').
* '''costì''' or '''costà''' is a locative adverb which refers to a place far from the speaker, but near the listener. It relates to ''codesto'' as ''qui/qua'' relates to ''questo'', and ''lì/là'' to ''quello''
* '''desinare''' (literary form in standard Italian) for ''pranzare'' (to have lunch)
* '''diaccio''' for ''ghiacciato'', ''freddo'' (frozen, cold)
* '''essi''' for ''sii'' (second-person singular imperative form of 'to be')
* '''furia''' (which means "fury" in standard Italian) for ''fretta'' (hurry)
* '''golpe''' for ''volpe'' (fox)
* '''garbare''' for ''piacere'' (to like) (but also ''piacere'' is sometimes used in Tuscany)
* '''gota''' (literary form in standard Italian) for ''guancia'' (cheek)
* '''ire''' for ''andare'' (to go) (only some forms as '''ito''' (gone))
* '''lapis'''  for ''matita'' (pencil) (cfr. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''lápiz'')
* '''popone''' for ''melone'' (cantaloupe)
* '''punto''' for ''per nulla'' or ''niente affatto'' (not at all) in negative sentences (cf. French ''ne ... point'')
* '''rigovernare''' for ''lavare i piatti'' (to do/wash the dishes)
* '''sciocco''' (which means "silly" or "stupid" in standard Italian) for ''insipido'' (insipid)
* '''sistola''' for ''tubo da giardinaggio'' (garden hose)
* '''sortire''' for ''uscire'' (to exit) (cfr. [[French language|French]] ''sortir'')
* '''sudicio''' for ''spazzatura'' (garbage) as a noun and for ''sporco'' (dirty) as an adjective
* '''termosifone''' or '''radiatore''' for ''calorifero'' (radiator)
* '''tocco''' for ''le 13'' (one p.m.), lunch time
