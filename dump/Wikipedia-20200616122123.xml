__NOTOC__

This is a '''timeline of Roman history''', comprising important legal and territorial changes and political events in the [[Roman Kingdom]] and [[Roman Republic|Republic]] and the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire]]s.  To read about the background of these events, see [[Ancient Rome]] and [[History of the Byzantine Empire]].

Following tradition, this timeline marks the deposition of [[Romulus Augustulus]] and the [[Fall of Constantinople]] as the end of Rome in the west and east, respectively.  See [[Third Rome]] for a discussion of claimants to the succession of Rome.
