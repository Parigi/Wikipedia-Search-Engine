The single "Say Something" received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance|Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]] at the [[61st Annual Grammy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/2019-grammy-awards-complete-nominations-list |title=2019 GRAMMY Awards: Complete Nominations List |date=December 7, 2018 |work=[[The Recording Academy]] |accessdate=December 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
After completing the successful [[The 20/20 Experience World Tour|world tour]] for his previous records ''[[The 20/20 Experience]]'' and ''[[The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2]]'', Timberlake took a one-year break and later returned to produce [[Trolls (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] for the animated film ''[[Trolls (film)|Trolls]]'' in 2016. In a radio interview in May 2016 Timberlake first confirmed working on a new album but without a date set for release yet, "I think where I grew up in America has a lot of influence – Growing up in [[Tennessee]] – very central of the country – [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] is known as the birthplace of rock &amp; roll, but also the home of the blues, but [[Nashville]]'s right down the street so there's a lot of country music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/justin-timberlake-im-definitely-working-on-a-new-album-20160506 | title=Justin Timberlake: 'I'm Definitely Working on a New Album' | work=Rolling Stone | date=May 6, 2016 | accessdate=May 7, 2016 | author=Spanos, Brittany}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timberlake worked with producers [[Timbaland]], [[Danja (record producer)|Danja]], [[The Neptunes]], and [[Max Martin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.idolator.com/7648496/justin-timberlake-album-pharrell-timbaland-max-martin | title=Justin Timberlake Says He's Been in the Studio With Pharrell, Timbaland and Max Martin | work=Idolator|first=Rachel|last=Sonis | date=October 17, 2016 | accessdate=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in following interviews he stated, "It sounds more like where I've come from than any other music I've ever made... It's Southern American music. But I want to make it sound modern – at least that's the idea right now."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/justin-timberlake-jimmy-fallon-fatherhood-his-uncertain-future-972807 |title=Justin Timberlake on Fatherhood, His Uncertain Future and Being Best Friends With Jimmy Fallon |date=February 8, 2017 |access-date=February 8, 2017 |last=Svetkey |first=Benjamin |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, Timberlake's website displayed the logo featuring the letters "MOTW".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.rap-up.com/2017/12/30/justin-timberlake-teases-new-music-man-of-the-woods-motw/ |title=Justin Timberlake Teases New Music With Mysterious "MOTW" Logo |date=December 30, 2017 |work=Rap-Up |access-date=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' physical magazine reported that the album would feature a collaboration with singer-songwriter [[Chris Stapleton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://hiphop-n-more.com/2017/12/justin-timberlake-teases-man-of-the-woods-on-new-website/ |title=Justin Timberlake's Teases Man of the Woods on New Website |date=December 30, 2017 |work=Hip-Hop N More |access-date=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stapleton and Timberlake previously collaborated in a live performance at the [[49th Annual Country Music Association Awards|2015 CMA Awards]], with some music publications speculating his next record may be influenced by [[Music of Tennessee|Southern music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2015/11/18/justin-timberlake-country-album-timbaland/76000238/ |title=Justin Timberlake may go country on his next album, says Timbaland |last=McDermott |first=Maeve |date=November 18, 2015 |work=USA Today |access-date=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1760466/yall-ready-for-a-country-justin-timberlake/ |title=Ready for a Country Justin Timberlake? |last=Bonaguro |first=Allison |date=November 18, 2015 |work=CMT |access-date=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial discussions for the album began several years before the production of the album, between Timberlake and [[Pharrell Williams]]. Production was placed on hold for two years, while Timberlake and wife [[Jessica Biel]] had their son, Silas. Production began between Timberlake, Williams and [[Chad Hugo]], with the first song for the album being the title-track, which is the Latin translation of Timberlake's son's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hiphop-n-more.com/2018/01/watch-justin-timberlake-full-interview-with-zane-lowe/|title=Watch Justin Timberlake's Full Interview with Zane Lowe – HipHop-N-More|date=January 19, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timberlake had not worked with Williams and Hugo (also known as production duo [[The Neptunes]]) after a label dispute with rap group [[Clipse]] during Timberlake's time with [[Jive Records]]. During an interview with [[Beats 1]]'s [[Zane Lowe]], Timberlake said: "It became challenging for him to work with any Jive artist at that point. If I’m being totally honest about it I was extremely hurt being caught up in the middle of it, but at the same time I had a shitload of money stolen, you know, from me by somebody else when I was in [[NSYNC|the group]]. I had already gone through [[NSYNC#1998–99: Breaking the American market and legal battle|legal troubles]], and I kind of felt like, you know what, I’m at this point where I feel like I have so much ahead of me, I just don't want to be in the middle of the record label and somebody that, you know, I consider a friend. And so I feel like I kind of just removed myself from the situation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/pharrell-didnt-work-with-justin-timberlake-for-years-because-he-was-mad-about-clipse-justin-says/|title=Pharrell Didn't Work With Justin Timberlake for Years Because of Clipse Label Problems, Justin Says – Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/justin-timberlake-says-label-drama-stopped-him-and-the-neptunes-from-collaborating-news.42418.html|title=Justin Timberlake Says Label Drama Stopped Him &amp; The Neptunes From Collaborating|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with ''[[FutureSex/LoveSounds]]'', recording sessions for the album were loose and had multiple studios open for work. In one room, [[Danja (record producer)|Danja]] and [[Timbaland]] worked, Chad Hugo and Pharrell Williams of The Neptunes, worked in another room and producer and member of [[The Y's]], [[Rob Knox (producer)|Rob Knox]] and [[Eric Hudson]] worked in another. A direction was not discussed among the production team too much, as Timberlake already had an idea of the direction he wanted the album to take.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/justin-timberlake-producer-danja-talks-filthy-w515205|title=Justin Timberlake Producer Danja on Making the Wild, Futuristic 'Filthy'|work=Rolling Stone|first=Elias|last=Leight|date=January 9, 2018|accessdate=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'', producer Danja spoke of the recording sessions for ''Man of the Woods'', "We didn't have any conversations about the current state of music and that's what we always do. We go in the studio and just do what we feel. This time around, I just feel like he had more of a direction. Like, when we did ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'', we didn't have any conversations of direction or what's going on in the current state of music. We went in and had fun and made music." He also spoke about the vision that Timberlake had for the album: "I remember walking into the studio, and I'm like, 'So, what's the vibe?' He just raised his hands up like, 'This is the vibe.' And what he had on was a [[flannel]], some [[Adidas]], some jeans. He had his beard and a [[knit cap|skully]] on. That was the vibe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2018/01/danja-interview-justin-timberlake-filthy-man-of-the-woods|title=Producer Danja Explains Why Justin Timberlake's "Filthy" Doesn't Sound Like A Country Song|work=Complex.com|date=January 7, 2018|first=Frazier|last=Tharpe|accessdate=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timberlake's wife, Jessica Biel and his son Silas, have uncredited vocals on a number of songs on the album. Biel appears on the album's lead-single "Filthy" and "Hers (Interlude)". When sequencing the album, Timberlake felt that "Filthy" was "a palette-cleanser, then we wanted to take you into the forest, take you outside, so I felt like I needed a voice of consciousness". Timberlake wrote Biel's parts for her, which were subsequently recorded on the Voicenotes [[iPhone]] application. Timberlake wanted her to sound like "the ghost, a presence, but we're following [her]". The "Hers (Interlude)" was recorded after Timberlake mixed the album's eleventh song "Flannel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rll790aP60Q&amp;t=1219s|title=Justin Timberlake and Zane Lowe on Beats 1 [Part 1]|first=|last=Beats 1 Radio|date=January 18, 2018|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/justin-timberlake/news/justin-timberlake-unveils-western-man-of-the-woods-tracklist|title=Justin Timberlake Unveils Western 'Man of the Woods' Tracklist – MTV UK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When announcing his [[Man of the Woods Tour]], Timberlake revealed the inspiration for both the album and tour came from the outdoors as well as his family, "The outdoors is the inspiration for a lot of these songs.

Chris Stapleton (who is featured on the album's third single "Say Something") was initially only writing songs with Timberlake, before being asked to sing on the song, "I really just went out to [[Los Angeles]] to write songs with him, it's a very fluid process with him, there's a lot going on. That was one of those things where there wasn't necessarily a plan. He was like ‘All right, you hop in there and take a verse,’ and I’m like, ‘You want me to do what?’ ... It came out great. I had a blast with him, he's a great creative force and one of those guys that if you get a chance to work with him, you should.". Stapleton also has writing credits on other songs on the album, including the Alicia Keys-featuring "Morning Light" and "The Hard Stuff" as well as guitar on the lead-single "Filthy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8096846/chris-stapleton-justin-timberlake-say-something-man-of-the-woods-grammys-interview|title=Chris Stapleton Talks Working With Justin Timberlake on 'Say Something' &amp; His Sneaky Appearance on 'Filthy'|publisher=|accessdate=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The genre of the album incorporates traditional [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] as well as influences from [[Country music|country]] and [[funk]] described as "...[[Americana (music)|Americana]] with [[Roland TR-808|808s]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/see-justin-timberlake-tease-new-album-in-behind-the-scenes-doc-w515471|title=Watch Justin Timberlake Tease New Album in Behind-the-Scenes Doc|work=Rolling Stone|last=Blistein|first=Jon|date=January 16, 2018|accessdate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a second teaser trailer for the album, Timberlake said that the album has a number of influences. "It's meant to be heard outside even more than inside, I believe. You talk about those, like, Southern guitars and that sound that feels like heritage. That is me exercising my love for where I came from."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3058933/justin-timberlake-new-album-outdoors/|title=Justin Timberlake Thinks You Should Listen To His New Album Outdoors|last=Holmes|first=Charles|work=MTV|date=January 16, 2018|accessdate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described most of the album's first half is "cosmopolitan future-funk,"&lt;ref name="rolling stone review"/&gt; while ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated the music is funk-soul.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;

''Man of the Woods'' received mixed reviews from music critics. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 55 based on 29 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref name="Metacritic"/&gt;

In ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Christopher R. Weingarten gave the album a positive review, saying "parts of ''Man of the Woods'' are his most exploratory music in years."&lt;ref name="rolling stone review"/&gt; In ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Chris Willman expressed "there are plenty of reasons to like ''Man of the Woods'', not least that it's got a good beat and you can dance to it," and concluded "It's the utterly weird boldness of Timberlake figuratively dragging Pharrell and Danja into the middle of a frosty field that makes the album memorable.
