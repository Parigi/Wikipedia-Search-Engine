{{Maya civilization}}
'''Maya cities''' were the centres of population of the [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]] of [[Mesoamerica]]. They served the specialised roles of administration, [[Trade in Maya civilization|commerce]], manufacturing and [[Maya religion|religion]] that characterised [[Ancient city|ancient cities]] worldwide.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p71"&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.71.&lt;/ref&gt; Maya cities tended to be more dispersed than cities in other societies, even within Mesoamerica, as a result of adaptation to a lowland tropical environment that allowed food production amidst areas dedicated to other activities.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p71"/&gt; They lacked the grid plans of the highland cities of central Mexico, such as [[Teotihuacán]] and [[Tenochtitlan]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham 2005, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maya rulers|Maya kings]] ruled their kingdoms from palaces that were situated within the centre of their cities.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p15"&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Cities tended to be located in places that controlled trade routes or that could supply essential products.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p85"&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the elites that controlled trade to increase their wealth and status.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p85"/&gt; Such cities were able to construct temples for public ceremonies, thus attracting further inhabitants to the city.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p85"/&gt; Those cities that had favourable conditions for food production, combined with access to trade routes, were likely to develop into the capital cities of early Maya states.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p85"/&gt;

The political relationship between Classic Maya [[city-state]]s has been likened to the relationships between city-states in [[Classical Greece]] and [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]].&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p21"/&gt; Some cities were linked to each other by straight limestone causeways, known as ''[[sacbe]]ob'', although whether the exact function of these roads was commercial, political or religious has not been determined.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p35"/&gt;

==Architectural organization==
{{see also|Maya architecture}}
[[File:Palenque 16.jpg|thumb|Classic Period royal palace at [[Palenque]]]]
Maya cities were not formally planned like the cities of highland Mexico and were subject to irregular expansion, with the haphazard addition to all of the palaces, temples and other buildings.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p34"&gt;Olmedo Vera 1997, p.34.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Maya cities tended to grow outwards from the core, and upwards as new structures were superimposed upon preceding [[Maya architecture|architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; Maya cities usually had a ceremonial and administrative centre surrounded by a vast irregular sprawl of residential complexes.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p34"/&gt; The centres of all Maya cities featured sacred precincts, sometimes separated from nearby residential areas by walls.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p23"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; These precincts contained [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramid]] temples and other monumental architecture dedicated to elite activities, such as basal platforms that supported administrative or elite residential complexes.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p24"&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; Sculpted monuments were raised to record the deeds of the ruling dynasty.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p24"/&gt; City centres also featured plazas, sacred [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]] and buildings used for marketplaces and schools.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p24"/&gt; Frequently [[Sacbe|causeways]] linked the centre to outlying areas of the city.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p23"/&gt; Some of these classes of architecture formed lesser groups in the outlying areas of the city, which served as sacred centres for non-royal lineages.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p24"/&gt; The areas adjacent to these sacred compounds included residential complexes housing wealthy lineages.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p24"/&gt; [[Maya art|Art]] excavated from these elite residential complexes varies in quality according to the rank and prestige of the lineage that it housed.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p24"/&gt; The largest and richest of these elite compounds sometimes possessed sculpture and art of craftsmanship equal to that of royal art.&lt;ref name="ScheleMathews99p24"/&gt;

The ceremonial centre of the Maya city was where the ruling elite lived, and where the administrative functions of the city were performed, together with religious ceremonies. It was also where the inhabitants of the city gathered for public activities.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p34"/&gt; Elite residential complexes occupied the best land around the city centre, while commoners had their residences dispersed further away from the ceremonial centre.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p35"&gt;Olmedo Vera 1997, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; Residential units were built on top of stone platforms to raise them above the level of the rain season floodwaters.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p35"/&gt;

==Population estimates==
[[File:Mayamap.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Maya region showing locations of some of the principal cities. Click to enlarge.]]
Until the 1960s, scholarly opinion was that the ruins of Maya centres were not true cities but were rather empty ceremonial centres where the priesthood performed religious rituals for the peasant farmers, who lived dispersed in the middle of the jungle.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p6"&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, formal archaeological mapping projects have revealed that the ceremonial centres in fact formed the centres of dispersed cities that possessed populations that at some sites could reach tens of thousands.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p6"/&gt;

==History==
{{see also|History of the Maya civilization}}

===Middle Preclassic Period===
During the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle Preclassic Period]] (1000-400 BC), small villages began to grow to form cities.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p26"&gt;Olmedo Vera 1997, p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; By 500 BC these cities possessed large temple structures decorated with [[stucco]] masks representing [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|gods]].&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p8"&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nakbe]] in the [[Petén Department]] of [[Guatemala]] is the earliest well-documented city in the Maya lowlands,&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p214"&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.214.&lt;/ref&gt; where large structures have been dated to around 750 BC.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p26"/&gt; Nakbe already featured the monumental masonry [[Maya architecture|architecture]], sculpted monuments and [[sacbe|causeways]] that characterised later cities in the Maya lowlands.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p214"/&gt;

===Late Preclassic Period===
In the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Preclassic Period]] (400 BC - 250 AD), the enormous city of [[El Mirador]] grew to cover approximately {{convert|16|km2|sqmi}}.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p28"&gt;Olmedo Vera 1997, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt; It possessed paved avenues, massive [[triadic pyramid]] complexes dated to around 150 BC, and [[Maya stelae|stelae]] and altars that were erected in its plazas.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p28"/&gt; El Mirador is considered to be one of the first capital cities of the Maya civilization.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p28"/&gt; The swamps of the Mirador Basin appear to have been the primary attraction for the first inhabitants of the area as evidenced by the unusual cluster of large cities around them.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen et al. 2006, p.740.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Tikal]], later to be one of the most important of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]] Maya cities, was already a significant city by around 350 BC, although it did not match El Mirador.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p25-26"&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, pp.25-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The Late Preclassic cultural florescence collapsed in the 1st century AD and many of the great Maya cities of the epoch were abandoned; the cause of this collapse is as yet unknown.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p8"/&gt;

In the highlands, [[Kaminaljuyu]] in the Valley of Guatemala was already a sprawling city by AD 300.&lt;ref&gt;Demarest 2004, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classic Period===
[[File:Chichen Itza ruins in Mexico -- by John Romkey.jpg|thumb|right|Chichén Itzá was the most important city in the northern Maya region]]
During the Classic Period (AD 250-900), the Maya civilization achieved its greatest florescence.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p8"/&gt; During the Early Classic (AD 250-300), cities throughout the Maya region were influenced by the great metropolis of [[Teotihuacan]] in the distant [[Valley of Mexico]].&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p9"&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; At its height during the Late Classic, Tikal had expanded to have a population of well over 100,000.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p1"&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Tikal's great rival was Calakmul, another powerful city in the Petén Basin.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p36"&gt;Olmedo Vera 1997, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; In the southeast, [[Copán]] was the most important city.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p36"/&gt; [[Palenque]] and [[Yaxchilán]] were the most powerful cities in the [[Usumacinta River|Usumacinta]] region.&lt;ref name="Olmedo97p36"/&gt; In the north of the Maya area, [[Coba]] was the most important Maya capital.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p554"/&gt; Capital cities of Maya kingdoms could vary considerably in size, apparently related to how many vassal cities were tied to the capital.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p19"&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; Overlords of city-states that held sway over a greater number of subordinate lords could command greater quantities of tribute in the form of goods and labour.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p21"&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable forms of tribute pictured on [[Maya ceramics]] are [[cocoa bean|cacao]], [[Maya textiles|textiles]] and feathers.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p21"/&gt; During the 9th century AD, the central Maya region suffered [[Classic Maya collapse|major political collapse]], marked by the abandonment of cities, the ending of dynasties and a northward shift of population.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p9"/&gt; During this period, known as the Terminal Classic, the northern cities of [[Chichen Itza]] and [[Uxmal]] show increased activity.&lt;ref name="MartinGrube00p9"/&gt; Major cities in [[Mexico]]'s [[Yucatán Peninsula]] continued to be inhabited long after the cities of the southern lowlands ceased to raise monuments.&lt;ref&gt;Becker 2004, p.135.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postclassic Period===
The Postclassic Period (AD 900-c.1524) was marked by a series of changes that distinguished its cities from those of the preceding Classic Period.&lt;ref name="Arroyo01p38"&gt;Arroyo 2001, p.38.&lt;/ref&gt; The once-great city of [[Kaminaljuyu]] in the Valley of Guatemala was abandoned after a period of continuous occupation that spanned almost two thousand years.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p618"&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.618.&lt;/ref&gt; This was symptomatic of changes that were sweeping across the [[Guatemalan Highlands|highlands]] and neighbouring Pacific coast, with long-occupied cities in exposed locations relocated, apparently due to a proliferation of [[Maya warfare|warfare]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p618"/&gt; Cities came to occupy more-easily defended hilltop locations surrounded by deep ravines, with ditch-and-wall defences sometimes supplementing the protection provided by the natural terrain.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p618"/&gt; Chichen Itza, in the north, became what was probably the largest, most powerful and most cosmopolitan of all Maya cities.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p559"&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, p.559.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most important cities in the [[Guatemalan Highlands]] at this time was [[Qʼumarkaj]], also known as Utatlán, the capital of the aggressive [[Kʼicheʼ Kingdom of Qʼumarkaj|Kʼicheʼ Maya kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Arroyo01p38"/&gt;

===Conquest and rediscovery===
{{Main article|Spanish conquest of the Maya}}
{{See also|Spanish conquest of Yucatán|Spanish conquest of Guatemala|Spanish conquest of Petén|Spanish conquest of Chiapas}}
[[File:Zacuelu2.jpg|thumb|left|Zaculeu fell to the Spanish in 1525]]
The cities of the Postclassic highland Maya kingdoms fell to the invading Spanish [[conquistador]]s in the first half of the 16th century. The [[Kʼicheʼ people|Kʼicheʼ]] capital, [[Qʼumarkaj]], fell to [[Pedro de Alvarado]] in 1524.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer &amp; Traxler 2006, pp.764-765. Recinos 1952, 1986, pp.68, 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, the Spanish were invited as allies into [[Iximche]], the capital city of the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] Maya.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.297. Guillemín 1965, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; Good relations did not last and the city was abandoned a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Mathews 1999, p.298.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the fall of [[Zaculeu]], the [[Mam people|Mam]] Maya capital, in 1525.&lt;ref&gt;Recinos 1952, 1986, p.110. del Águila Flores 2007, p.38.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1697, [[Martín de Ursúa]] launched an assault upon the [[Itza people|Itza]] capital [[Tayasal|Nojpetén]] and the last remaining independent Maya city fell to the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1998, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, the existence of five former Maya cities was known in the [[Petén Department|Petén]] region of [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="Quintana03p381"&gt;Quintana 2003, p.381.&lt;/ref&gt; Nojpetén had been visited by Spanish conquistador [[Hernán Cortés]] in 1525,&lt;ref&gt;Jones 2000, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a number of missionaries at the beginning of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Quintana03p381"/&gt; The city was finally razed when it was conquered in 1697.&lt;ref name="Quintana03p381"/&gt; Juan Galindo, governor of Petén, described the ruins of the Postclassic city of [[Topoxte]] in 1834.&lt;ref name="Quintana03p381"/&gt; Modesto Méndez, a later governor of Petén, published a description of the ruins of the once great city of Tikal in 1848.&lt;ref name="Quintana03p381"/&gt; [[Teoberto Maler]] described the ruins of the city of [[Motul de San José]] in 1895.&lt;ref name="Quintana03p381"/&gt; [[San Clemente, El Petén|San Clemente]] was described by [[Karl Sapper]] in the same year.&lt;ref name="Quintana03p381"/&gt; The number of known cities grew enormously during the course of the 20th century, 24 cities in Petén alone had been described by 1938.&lt;ref name="Quintana03p381"/&gt;
