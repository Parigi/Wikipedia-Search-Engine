'''Stuart Leslie Goddard''', better known as '''Adam Ant''' (born 3 November 1954) is an English singer and musician. He gained popularity as the lead singer of [[new wave music|new wave]] group [[Adam and the Ants]] and later as a solo artist, scoring 10 UK top ten hits from 1980 to 1983, including three UK No. 1 singles. He has also worked as an actor, appearing in over two dozen films and television episodes from 1985 to 2003.

Born in [[Marylebone]], [[London]], Ant began his musical career playing bass in the band [[Bazooka Joe (band)|Bazooka Joe]]. From 1977 to 1982 he performed as Adam and the Ants and their debut album ''[[Dirk Wears White Sox]]'' (1979) reached number one on the [[UK Indie Chart|UK Independent Albums Chart]]. Prior to recording his second album as Adam and the Ants, he asked producer [[Malcolm McLaren]] to manage his band, who instead took his backing band to form [[Bow Wow Wow]]. Ant regrouped with new members, including [[Marco Pirroni]] to release his second album ''[[Kings of the Wild Frontier]]'' (1980). It reached number one in the [[UK Album Chart]], spawned three hit singles and the album was the UK number one selling album in 1981 (and the 48th best seller in 1980) and won Best British Album at the 1982 Brit Awards. He released his third and final album with the group, ''[[Prince Charming (album)|Prince Charming]]'' (1981), which spawned two UK number one singles "[[Stand and Deliver (Adam and the Ants song)|Stand and Deliver]]" and "[[Prince Charming (Adam and the Ants song)|Prince Charming]]".

In 1982, he disbanded his group for a solo career retaining only [[Marco Pirroni]] as a bandmember and co-songwriter for later solo albums. His first solo album was ''[[Friend or Foe (album)|Friend or Foe]]'' (1982), which the debut single "[[Goody Two-Shoes (song)|Goody Two-Shoes]]" reached number one in the UK and Australia in 1982 and became his first top 20 hit in the United States. The album reached number five on the UK Albums Chart and number 16 on the US Billboard Album Chart, becoming his most successful solo album. His next two solo albums ''[[Strip (Adam Ant album)|Strip]]'' (1983) and ''[[Vive Le Rock]]'' (1985) were less commercially successful in the UK and US and were a noted stylistic departure of his earlier rock albums being more grounded in pop and dance. During this time, Ant also began to focus on an acting career performing on stage and in television and movie roles throughout the 1980s and 1990s. He released his fourth solo album ''[[Manners &amp; Physique]]'' (1990) which was produced by [[André Cymone]] and featured a [[Minneapolis sound]]. Despite the US Top 20 success of the single "Room At The Top" from that album, Ant was dropped from [[MCA Records]] and the fully recorded ''[[Persuasion (Adam Ant album)|Persuasion]]'' (1991) was shelved and never officially released. He signed with [[Capitol Records]] to release ''[[Wonderful (Adam Ant album)|Wonderful]]'' (1995), which featured more acoustic songs than his previous albums. The single "Wonderful" became Ant's third US Top 40 hit single. After a long break from music, Ant returned with his album ''[[Adam Ant Is the Blueblack Hussar in Marrying the Gunner's Daughter]]'' (2013) which was released on his own label Blueblack Hussar Records. Despite the independent self-release, the album reached number 25 on the UK Albums Chart, only one place lower than ''Wonderful'', which was released 18 years earlier.

Since 2010, Ant has reactivated his musical career, performing live regularly in his hometown of London and beyond, recording and releasing a new album and completing six full-length UK national tours, four US national tours, and two Australian tours and with a fifth US tour scheduled and a further album completed and awaiting release.

==Early life==
Stuart Goddard was born in [[Marylebone]], [[London]]. He was  the only child of Leslie Alfred Goddard and Betty Kathleen Smith.  His father had served in the [[Royal Air Force]] and worked as a chauffeur, and his mother was an embroiderer for [[Norman Hartnell]].&lt;ref name= "SD Autobio" /&gt;{{rp|4}} His home was two rooms in De Walden buildings, [[St John's Wood]].&lt;ref name= "SD Autobio" /&gt;{{rp|5}} He recalls: "There was no luxury, but there was always food on the table.” He is of partial [[Romani people|Romani]] descent; his maternal grandfather, Walter Albany Smith, was [[Romanichal]].&lt;ref name= "SD Autobio"&gt;{{cite book| last= Ant| first= A.| title= Stand and Deliver: The Autobiography| location= London| publisher= Pan Books| year= 2007| isbn= 978-0-330-44012-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} This heritage became a basis for a theme in his later work: a concern for oppressed minorities.

His parents divorced when Goddard was seven years old&lt;ref name= "SD Autobio" /&gt;{{rp|35}} and his mother supported him by working as a domestic cleaner, briefly working for [[Paul McCartney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Spears |url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/80s/adam-ant-interview-how-tennessee-and-paul-mccartney-influenced-the-dandy/2132026 |title=Adam Ant interview: How Tennessee and Paul McCartney influenced the Dandy Highwayman |work=Tampa Bay Times; Tampabay.com |date=18 July 2013 |accessdate=20 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225223208/http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/80s/adam-ant-interview-how-tennessee-and-paul-mccartney-influenced-the-dandy/2132026 |archivedate=25 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Goddard's first school was Robinsfield Infants School, where he created a considerable stir by throwing a brick through the head-teacher's office window on two consecutive days.&lt;ref name= "SD Autobio" /&gt;{{rp|28}} In the aftermath of this incident, Goddard was placed under the supervision of teacher Joanna Saloman, who encouraged him to develop his abilities in art and whom he later credited as the first person to show him he could be creative.&lt;ref&gt;The Madness of Prince Charming, Channel 4 Television 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Official Adam Ant Story, James Maw, Futura Publications 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

Goddard then attended Barrow Hill Junior School where he boxed, was a member of the cricket team&lt;ref name= "SD Autobio" /&gt;{{rp|32}} and passed the [[eleven plus exam]] to gain a place at [[St Marylebone Grammar School]]&lt;ref name= "SD Autobio" /&gt;{{rp|56}} which was an all boys school where he enjoyed history lessons, played [[rugby football|rugby]]&lt;ref name= "SD Autobio" /&gt;{{rp|57}} and later became a school [[prefect]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} After taking and passing six [[O levels]] and three [[A levels]] in English, History and Art,&lt;ref name= "SD Autobio" /&gt;{{rp|72}} Goddard then attended  [[Hornsey College of Art]] to study graphic design and for a time was a student of Peter Webb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Walker| first= John| year= 1987| chapter-url= http://www.artdesigncafe.com/Adam-Ant-art-school-1987| chapter= Adam Ant: music + art school| title= Cross-Overs: Art into Pop, Pop into Art| access-date= 6 February 2012| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120801235705/http://www.artdesigncafe.com/Adam-Ant-art-school-1987| archive-date= 1 August 2012| url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later dropped out of Hornsey, short of completing his BA, to focus on a career in music.&lt;ref name= "SD Autobio" /&gt;{{rp|4}}

===Early musical career===
The first band Goddard joined was [[Bazooka Joe (band)|Bazooka Joe]], in which he played bass guitar.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Since starting his course at Hornsey, Goddard had married fellow student Carol Mills, with whom he lived at her parents' residence in [[Muswell Hill]]. Shortly after, he developed [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]]. "I just didn't eat," he has said of this period, "I wasn't attempting to slim, I was attempting to kill myself." Eventually, Goddard took an overdose of all the pills he could find in his mother-in-law's kitchen cabinet. After having his stomach pumped, he was sent to Colney Hatch psychiatric hospital in North London, eventually being discharged after 3 months&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lachno, James (27 April 2011). [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopmusic/8478052/The-rise-and-fall-of-Adam-Ant.html "The rise and fall of Adam Ant"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408010113/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopmusic/8478052/The-rise-and-fall-of-Adam-Ant.html |date=8 April 2018 }} – via www.telegraph.co.uk.&lt;/ref&gt; on condition of supervision by Mills. "I was totally fucked-up in the head. Things went wrong and something snapped. I just became a vegetable for three months. I couldn't talk to people. I was very ill and that was part of the reason I left college."&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/sep/08/features.magazine37 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Adam | last=Higginbotham | title=You wouldn't know him from Adam | date=8 September 2002 | access-date=13 December 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305151019/http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/sep/08/features.magazine37 | archive-date=5 March 2016 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his discharge from the hospital, Goddard renamed himself Adam Ant, choosing the name because, "I really knew I wanted to be Adam, because [[Adam]] was the [[Adam and Eve|first man]]. Ant I chose because, if there's a nuclear explosion, the ants will survive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Adam Ant on fame and infamy | website=BBC News | date=23 February 2011 | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-12546301 | access-date=15 April 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216050723/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-12546301 | archive-date=16 February 2019 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; He remade connections with fellow former B-Sides [[Lester Square]] and [[Andy Warren (British musician)|Andy Warren]] and together with drummer Paul Flanagan, they formed Adam and the Ants (initially named just "The Ants") in 1977, with the inaugural band meeting held in the audience at a [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] performance at the Roxy Club in London's [[Covent Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;Antconcerts &amp; Events list section, Antcatalogue – distributed with [[Kings of the Wild Frontier]] LP, CBS 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical career==
===1977–1982: Adam and the Ants===
{{Main|Adam and the Ants}}
Adam and the Ants started as part of the burgeoning punk rock movement.  Ant later acted in [[Derek Jarman]]'s seminal "punk" film ''[[Jubilee (1978 film)|Jubilee]]'' in 1977, as Adam and the Ants was beginning to gig around London with manager [[Jordan (Pamela Rooke)|Jordan]] from the [[SEX (boutique)|SEX Boutique]] on [[Kings Road]]. His debut as a recording artist was the song "[[Deutscher Girls]]", which featured on the film's soundtrack, along with "Plastic Surgery" which was performed in the film itself. "Deutscher Girls"/"Plastic Surgery" was re-released as a single in 1982. The band toured extensively around the UK but proved to be unpopular with much of the British music press who disliked their fetishistic lyrics and imagery.  Late 1979 saw the release of their début album ''[[Dirk Wears White Sox]]'' (1979, [[Do It Records]]), with [[Matthew Ashman]] on guitar, [[Andy Warren (British musician)|Andy Warren]] on bass and [[David Barbarossa|Dave Barbarossa]] on drums.

Adam Ant approached [[Malcolm McLaren]] (the manager of The Sex Pistols) and asked him to manage the band. McLaren subsequently took the rest of the Ants from the original group when he introduced the singer [[Annabella Lwin]] and began the process of honing [[Bow Wow Wow]] for chart success. Later Adam seemed to have reconciled with the fact. "I like to use the word 'mutiny'. My band was happy to go. Malcolm tried to see if I could fit into Bow Wow Wow, but I never could've or would've. I might have had a broken heart at the time, but Malcolm didn't leave me with nothing.  He mentored me. He said: 'Look, what do you want?' I said: 'I wanna sell millions of records', and he said, 'Well, you're going the wrong way about it. This [debut album ''Dirk Wears White Sox''] is the kind of esoteric stuff you do when you've done eight albums, you're living on a yacht, and you can do what you want'," he remembered later.&lt;ref name= "q_nov_12"&gt;{{cite news | last= Perry | first= Andrew | work= Q Magazine | date= November 2012 | title=The Q Interview. Adam Ant. Nobody Could Have Stopped Me | pages= 26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new version of Adam and the Ants was formed with [[Marco Pirroni]] (guitar), [[Kevin Mooney]] (bass guitar), and two drummers, Terry Lee Miall and [[Chris Hughes (record producer)|Chris Hughes]] (ex-[[Dalek I Love You]]), who used the name "Merrick". The band signed a major label deal with [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] and recorded ''[[Kings of the Wild Frontier]]'' during the summer of 1980. The album was an enormous hit in the United Kingdom, and the "Antmania" that ensued put the band at the forefront of the [[New Romantic]] movement. The single "[[Antmusic]]" went to No.&amp;nbsp;2 on the UK singles chart by December 1980, but made it to No. 1 in the charts in Australia. Following the abrupt departure of Mooney in February 1981, bassist [[Gary Tibbs]], formerly of [[Roxy Music]], joined the band.

In November 1981, Adam &amp; the Ants released another highly successful album, ''[[Prince Charming (album)|Prince Charming]]''. The album featured two United Kingdom No.&amp;nbsp;1 singles – "[[Stand and Deliver (Adam and the Ants song)|Stand and Deliver]]" and the title track, "[[Prince Charming (Adam and the Ants song)|Prince Charming]]" – as well as the No.&amp;nbsp;3 UK hit "[[Ant Rap]]". This trio of singles was promoted by some of the most lavish music videos of the period and paved the way for Adam Ant's later acting career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/the-artist-formerly-known-as-prince-charming-629059.html|title=The Independent, December 2000|work=The Independent|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work schedule Adam Ant imposed upon himself was punishing. "I took no holidays – and I mean no holidays. When ''Kings of the Wild Frontier'' took off, I was halfway through making ''Prince Charming'', and so on, because we had to bring out an album and four singles a year. But the price you pay... I split my cartilage in [[Cleveland]] doing "Goody Two Shoes", it was my body saying, 'Look, no!' Then I was back onstage doing the Motown 25 [in 1983] show 10 days later, having had the operation. Nobody could have stopped me, or make me do it. I did it. I was very, very bad at pacing," he later remembered.&lt;ref name="q_nov_12"/&gt;

In March 1982, feeling certain band members "lacked enthusiasm" Ant disbanded the group. A few months after the split Ant launched a [[Adam Ant#Solo Career|solo career]] (though he retained Marco Pirroni as guitarist and co-songwriter).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Merrick returned to the band [[Dalek I Love You]] and subsequently produced many hits for [[Tears for Fears]].

===1982–2001: Solo Career===
{{main|Adam Ant's musical career}}
After the split, Ant went solo, taking his songwriting partner Pirroni with him. Merrick also briefly stayed aboard as drummer/producer for the UK edition of the first solo hit single "[[Goody Two-Shoes (song)|Goody Two Shoes]]" (which made it to No. 1 in the UK) and demos for the upcoming ''[[Friend or Foe (album)|Friend or Foe]]'' album before moving on to other production work, while Miall and Tibbs' contracts were left to expire.&lt;ref name="gaznterrycontractualsep82"&gt;News of Adam No.2, p.7, Arlington Press Ltd UK1982&lt;/ref&gt; The "Friend or Foe" album also produced another top ten single, "Friend or Foe", which reached no.9 in September 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/adam%20%26%20the%20ants|title=Official charts for artist: Adam and the Ants|website=Officialcharts.com|accessdate=22 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028161110/http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/adam%20%26%20the%20ants/|archive-date=28 October 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ant recruited a new band for touring, consisting of new dual drummers Bogdan Wiczling (ex-[[Fingerprintz]]) and Barry Watts (ex-[[Q-Tips (band)|Q-Tips]]), plus guitarist [[Cha Burns]] (also ex-Fingerprintz), bassist [[Chris Constantinou]] and the former Q-Tips brass section of trumpeter Tony Hughes and twin saxophonists Stewart van Blandamer and Steve Farr.&lt;ref&gt;Sleevenotes for single ''Desperate But Not Serious''&lt;/ref&gt; The new band made its debut at London's [[London Astoria|Astoria]] Theatre on 1 October 1982. A US tour began in New York on 8 November. On the 19th tour date on 20 February 1983 in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, Ant suffered a knee injury onstage (a relapse of a previous injury suffered while filming [[Jubilee (1978 film)|Jubilee]] in 1977), forcing the postponement and/or cancellation of dates throughout February and March while he recuperated.  Ant eventually returned to performing, performing as a guest on the ''[[NBC]]''' show ''[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]]'', joined onstage by [[Diana Ross]].

During his recuperation from the knee injury, Ant worked with Pirroni on new material&lt;ref name= "SD Autobio" /&gt;{{rp|214–215}} that formed the basis of Ant's second solo album [[Strip (Adam Ant album)|Strip]].

In July 1985, Ant secured a spot at the [[Live Aid]] concert – the first live performance of the "Ant/Marco/Wiczling/De Niro" band – but was asked to cut his set to one song, for which he chose his new single, the ''Vive le Rock'' title track&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,8314-1671546,00.html | title = Sound advice | last = Paphides| first= Peter | date = 2 July 2005 | accessdate = 12 September 2006 | newspaper = Times Online | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ant later claimed to regret playing the fundraiser, saying, "I was asked by Sir Bob to promote this concert. They had no idea they could sell it out. Then in Bob's book, he said, 'Adam was over the hill so I let him have one number.'... Doing that show was the biggest f**king mistake in the world.

A year after the top 15 hit single success of "Apollo 9", which reached no.13 in September 1984, the parent album ''[[Vive Le Rock]]'' was released in September 1985, to mixed reviews. As part of the promotion, the band performed a live TV session for [[Channel 4]] music show ''Bliss'' hosted by [[Muriel Gray]].  Several songs were recorded, although only two – Miss Thing from the new album and Killer in the Home from ''Kings of the Wild Frontier'' – were actually transmitted.&lt;ref name="gigs85"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adam-ant.net/1985.html |title=1985 |website=Adam-ant.net |accessdate=11 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328122139/http://www.adam-ant.net/1985.html |archive-date=28 March 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ant paused his career in music at the end of 1985 to focus on his acting career.&lt;ref name= "SD Autobio" /&gt;{{rp|244}} The Fort Lauderdale show was Ant's last full-length concert until February 1993.

The album was another moderate success, and featured the single ''Room at the Top'', which was a Top 20 hit on both sides of the Atlantic. ''Rough Stuff'' became the second single for the United States and Germany as ''Can't Set Rules About Love'' charted in the United Kingdom{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In 1995, Ant released the album, ''[[Wonderful (Adam Ant album)|Wonderful]]''. The title track was a successful single, as was a tour of the US in support of the album. While Ant and his group (which retained longtime guitarist Pirroni) played in smaller venues than they had played in the 1980s, the houses were often packed with enthusiastic fans. The tour was cut short due to Ant and Pirroni both contracting glandular fever.&lt;ref name= "SD Autobio" /&gt;{{rp|298}} Ant also played three shows at [[Shepherds Bush Empire]] in London and did a mini tour of [[Virgin Records|Virgin Record]] Shops playing selected tunes from the album ''Wonderful'' and signing records. Adam and his band also played shows in [[Dublin]], Glasgow, [[Middlesbrough]] and [[Stoke-on-Trent]].

In 1996, Ant and Pirroni recorded two new songs, ''Lamé'' and ''Inseminator'', for the soundtrack to Ant's latest film ''Drop Dead Rock''. Also around this time, they recorded a cover version of the [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] song ''[[Dandy in the Underworld]]''. The duo continued to demo other songs around this time, including such titles as ''Tough Blokes'', ''Justine'', ''Picasso Meets Gary Cooper'' and ''Call Me Sausage'', (the last of which leaked out into bootleg circulation among fans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartrouble.nl/interviews/marco2005-x03.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719014136/http://www.cartrouble.nl/interviews/marco2005-x03.html |archivedate=19 July 2011 |title=MARCO PIRRONI INTERVIEW 2005

Pirroni later referred to these recordings as the ''Blend Demos''. They also guested with such bands as [[Dweeb (band)|Dweeb]] and [[Rachel Stamp]].

===2002–2009: Mental health, autobiography===
Ant was poised to join the 1980s-focused ''Here &amp; Now'' tour in January 2002, but was unable to do so after he was arrested and charged with throwing a car alternator through a pub window and then threatening patrons with an imitation firearm. According to Ant, on the evening before the arrest, he had received telephone threats to himself and his young daughter from the jealous husband of a female Camden Market stallholder who had agreed to make some clothing for him. The following morning, advised by people around Camden that he would find the man in question at the Prince of Wales pub in Camden, Ant arrived there to confront his persecutor. Some of the pub patrons made fun of his appearance and told him in mocking terms that the man he was looking for was not present. Staff then asked him to leave as the premises were a private members' club. Before storming off, Ant angrily told them all that he would be back. Some hours later, finding a discarded car alternator in the street, Ant threw it through the pub window. The broken glass injured a local musician. Chased through the backstreets of Camden by pub security and others, he drove them away by pulling out an old World War II-era starting pistol, once the property of his father. Returning afterward to the main street, he was spotted by a police patrol, gun still in hand, and arrested as he tried to leave the scene in the back of a minicab&lt;ref name= "SD Autobio" /&gt;{{rp|312–315}}

Ant was brought to court at the Old Bailey. The charges against him, which included [[criminal damage]] and threatening members of the public, were reduced to a single count of causing [[affray]], to which he pleaded guilty. He was fined £500 and ordered to psychiatric care with a [[suspended sentence]]. In June 2003, he was arrested again by police after a conflict with a neighbour resulted in Ant attempting to smash in the neighbour's patio door with a shovel, and then lying down on the concrete floor of a café basement with his trousers pulled down, curling up, and trying to sleep.&lt;ref name= "SD Autobio" /&gt;{{rp|319}} Once again, he was charged with affray and criminal damage and spent time in psychiatric wards. In September of that year, he was [[Involuntary commitment|sectioned]] under the [[Mental Health Act 1983]] and spent a further six months receiving [[in-patient]] psychiatric care. He was eventually granted a [[conditional discharge]] by the judge at [[Highbury]] Magistrates Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2190656.stm | title = Adam Ant admits pub affray | date = 13 August 2002 | accessdate = 12 September 2006 | work = BBC News | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060514202014/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2190656.stm | archive-date = 14 May 2006 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One project from this period, however, which did go all the way to release was a guest appearance on an EP, ''Mike's Bikes'' by former Ants bassist [[Kevin Mooney]]'s new band, the Lavender Pill Mob, on Mooney's own label ''Le Coq Musique''. Ant provided lead vocals for ''Black Pirates'', a reworking of the song ''Chicken Outlaw'' by Mooney's earlier band Wide Boy Awake, inspired by Mooney's departure from the Ants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamandtheants.org/ant-talk/interview-kevin-mooney-2005 |title=Interview " Kevin Mooney " 2005 &amp;#124; Ant Lib Ønline &amp;#124; Adam &amp; the Ants Cømmunity Øutpost &amp;#124; Adam Ant News &amp; Events |website=Adamandtheants.org |accessdate=11 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317000429/http://www.adamandtheants.org/ant-talk/interview-kevin-mooney-2005 |archive-date=17 March 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ant's first live performance since The Bloomsbury in 2007 was at "Through The Looking Glass" bookshop in London on 18 March, at which he played "Ants Invasion", "Cartrouble", "Physical", and a cover of Iggy Pop's "The Passenger". A day later, on 19 March, Ant guested at a [[Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction]] gig at the Pipeline Bar, London E1, in which he provided lead vocals for the band's Top 20 hit "Prime Mover".&lt;ref name="gigs2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adam-ant.net/2010.html |title=2010 |website=Adam-ant.net |accessdate=11 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313134131/http://www.adam-ant.net/2010.html |archive-date=13 March 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ant performed yet another low key show at the Southwark Playhouse on Saturday 20 March.&lt;ref name="gigs2010" /&gt;
During the intervals Ant talked about Sony records, how he rejected an alleged £2.6&amp;nbsp;million O2 deal, and a new album collaboration with Chris McCormack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamandtheants.org/ant-news/adam-ant-appearance-zodiac-mindwarp |title=Adam Ant Appearance with Zodiac Mindwarp |website=Adamandtheants.org |accessdate=11 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426055250/http://www.adamandtheants.org/ant-news/adam-ant-appearance-zodiac-mindwarp |archive-date=26 April 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Tuesday 18 May 2010 Adam Ant was returned to psychiatric hospital – in his own words "''at Her Majesty's Pleasure''" —, albeit in a comfortable regime at a London NHS hospital, where he remained until mid-June, subsequently returning home under outpatient supervision. In an official statement, Ant expressed an intention to perform further gigs later in the year once his hospitalisation had ended.&lt;ref name="hospital 2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamandtheants.org/ant-news/adam-ant-sectioned-under-mental-health-act |title=Adam Ant Sectioned Under Mental Health Act |website=Adamandtheants.org |accessdate=11 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317000728/http://www.adamandtheants.org/ant-news/adam-ant-sectioned-under-mental-health-act |archive-date=17 March 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he gave at least one live performance in the immediate aftermath of his release (a [[jam (music)|jam]] at a Chelsea bar at some point during the weekend of 19–20 June 2010), which appeared consistent with his previously stated intentions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adamandtheants.org/ant-news/adam-ant-returns-fold |title=Adam Ant Returns to the Fold |website=Adamandtheants.org |accessdate=11 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426055649/http://www.adamandtheants.org/ant-news/adam-ant-returns-fold |archive-date=26 April 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; he otherwise kept a mostly low profile for the rest of his supervised outpatient period.&lt;ref name="gigs2010" /&gt; Some smaller [[guerilla gig]]s were performed that Autumn which received no advance billing whatsoever, including a solo show at the Dark Mills festival at London's Colour House Theatre on 4 September 2010, the launch party of the Illamasqua store on 16 September (at which [[Boy George]] served as DJ), and a guest spot at the [[Monster Raving Loony Party]]'s annual conference in [[Fleet, Hampshire]], on 25 September.

An exhibition of photographs of Ant – titled ''Adam Ant – Dandy in the Underworld'' ran from 7 March 2012 to 29 April 2012 at Proud Camden in London, featuring images of Ant throughout his career, including the work of Chris Duffy, [[Gerard McNamara]], [[Jill Furmanovsky]], Denis O'Regan, Chris Cuffaro, Hannah Domagala, Robert Matheu, David Corio and [[Janette Beckman]].  To promote this exhibition, Ant performed a solo charity concert at the gallery on 6 March&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.m-magazine.co.uk/news/general-news/adam-ant-photo-exhibition/ |title=Adam Ant photo exhibition &amp;#124; M magazine: PRS for Music Members Magazine |website=M-magazine.co.uk |date=31 January 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204232957/http://www.m-magazine.co.uk/news/general-news/adam-ant-photo-exhibition/ |archive-date=4 February 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the same two band members as the Ronnie Scotts concert from the previous December.

The ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' gave a reservedly positive review of the opening [[Sydney]] date on 23 March (which it rated three stars out of five), noting "In a set plus two encores (the first cheered for; the second not really but played anyway) comprising 30 songs, it was kind of the equivalent of throwing a lot of make-up at the mirror and seeing what stuck."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/much-less-bite-but-this-ant-still-inspires-20120325-1vsn7.html |title=Much less bite but this Ant still inspires |website=Smh.com.au |date=26 March 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328041910/http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/much-less-bite-but-this-ant-still-inspires-20120325-1vsn7.html |archive-date=28 March 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ant also made further Australian TV appearances including a return to ''Adam Hills in Gordon Street Tonight'' recorded on 26 March for transmission on 28 March, including live performances of "Stand and Deliver" and new album track "Vince Taylor" with his full band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.starobserver.com.au/celebrity-2/2012/03/08/abc-hosts-mass-same-sex-tv-wedding/73663 | title= ABC hosts mass same-sex TV wedding | website= Starobserver.com.au | accessdate= 11 April 2012 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120311050358/http://www.starobserver.com.au/celebrity-2/2012/03/08/abc-hosts-mass-same-sex-tv-wedding/73663 | archive-date= 11 March 2012 | url-status= live | date= 8 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, for the second year running, Ant was scheduled to make appearances on the summer festival circuit, interspersed with various one-off dates around the UK.  This got off to an early start when Ant stepped in as replacement headliner at the Bearded Theory festival in Derby on 18 May 2012, when the [[Levellers (band)|Levellers]] had to pull out due to one of the band members being injured. Ant also played the first full band concert in continental Europe of his 2010s comeback on 24 June 2012 at the Parkpop festival in the Zuiderpark in [[the Hague]], Netherlands, with his set broadcast on Dutch national TV.  After six assorted dates around the UK in early July, Ant's next major show was a headline slot at the [[Silverstone]] Classic Festival on 21 July&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adam-ant.net/whatsnew.html#silverstone |title=Latest News: Silverstone Classic Festival |website=Adam-ant.net |accessdate=11 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410031748/http://www.adam-ant.net/whatsnew.html#silverstone |archive-date=10 April 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed the next day by an appearance at Rewind in [[Perth]] and then at [[Camp Bestival]] on 27 July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adam-ant.net/whatsnew.html#bestival |title=Latest News: Bestival |website=Adam-ant.net |accessdate=11 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410031748/http://www.adam-ant.net/whatsnew.html#bestival |archive-date=10 April 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the summer saw Ant mix festivals such as the [[Summer Sundae Weekender]] on 18 August, [[Solfest]] on 24 August and the Isle of Wight Bestival with dates in such locations as [[Swindon]], [[Southend-on-Sea]], [[Warrington]] and [[Croydon]].&lt;ref name="net2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whatsnew" /&gt; Later in the year, Ant's postponed US tour finally went ahead, commencing 13 September in Los Angeles and finishing on 20 October in nearby Anaheim.  The third UK tour of the 2010s, the Blueblack Hussar Tour, commenced on 1 November in Glasgow and ran to 30 November at London's [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]].&lt;ref name="whatsnew" /&gt; During the tour, the first single of the new album was released – Cool Zombie, with the formerly planned A-side Gun in Your Pocket now as the B-side.  On New Year's Eve 2012, Ant and his full band appeared on [[Jools Holland]]'s [[Hootenanny]] New Year music show, performing new album track Vince Taylor as well as old hits Stand And Deliver and Antmusic.

===2013–present: Release of new album and tours===
[[File:Adam Ant Concert.jpg|thumb|Adam Ant performing live at the Republik in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], in a concert by the [[BAMP Project]]]]
The album, the focal point of the comeback since 2010, finally received its release on 21 January 2013. Its gestation had a long history which had been running alongside the live comeback; in 2009, it was announced that Ant was planning on putting a new record out, with "sources" telling ''The Sun'' that labels were involved in a bidding war over the new material. Adam also expressed interest in working with [[The Kaiser Chiefs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine

In an April 2010 interview for the NME, Ant announced he was also working on a new album, with the title ''[[Adam Ant Is the Blueblack Hussar in Marrying the Gunner's Daughter]]''. This was planned to feature collaborations with former 3 Colours Red guitarist Chris McCormack, Ant's long-time songwriting partner Marco Pirroni, a member of Oasis (later identified as [[Andy Bell (musician)|Andy Bell]])&lt;ref name="holymoly.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holymoly.com/celebrity-news/adam-ants-comeback-all-delusion45650 |title=Adam Ant's comeback "all delusion" &amp;#124; Celebrity News |website=Holy Moly! |accessdate=11 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712214236/http://www.holymoly.com/celebrity-news/adam-ants-comeback-all-delusion45650 |archivedate=12 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Morrissey's writing partner [[Boz Boorer]]. According to Ant, the album is a "live record that lends itself to performance" and will feature a "kind of concept. It's a very old-fashioned, old-school, step-by-step album".  He also described the album as "very autobiographical, very personal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/culture/adam-ant-interview-071513|title=Adam Ant Interview – Adam Ant on Punk|first=Mick|last=Stingley|work=Esquire|access-date=29 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227061731/http://www.esquire.com/blogs/culture/adam-ant-interview-071513|archive-date=27 December 2014|url-status=live|date=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Ant re-recorded a song in tribute to the late Sex Pistols manager [[Malcolm McLaren]], who died earlier that month, and who also once managed Adam &amp; The Ants. Named ''Who's A Goofy Bunny Then?'', the track was only previously available as a demo recorded in the early 1980s, but Ant said he wanted to release a new version in tribute to the late punk manager. "Malcolm was a sort of mentor in my life", he explained. "As close as you can get to a surrogate father". The song took its name from a term of endearment bestowed upon McLaren by Ant – referring to his "quite prominent teeth".&lt;ref name="NME-April-2010"&gt;{{cite web

On 31 December 2010, Ant gave an interview for ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' (featured in the "Something for the Weekend" segment) in which he discussed in considerable detail the various controversies surrounding his recent life and musical activities. He summed up his upcoming album thus: "The Blueblack Hussar is me coming back to life.

It had previously been at number 8 in the [[Midweeks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adam-ant.com/new-album-8th-in-the-mid-week-chart/ |title=The Official Adam Ant Website |website=Adam-ant.com |date=23 January 2013 |accessdate=27 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515094432/http://www.adam-ant.com/new-album-8th-in-the-mid-week-chart/ |archive-date=15 May 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; To promote the album, Ant performed a series of concerts around the British Isles during April and May (billed as a "Spring Tour") culminating in a gig at [[The Roundhouse]] on 11 May. A free concert in Rome took place on 14 June and a second full length 40 plus show US tour got underway on 17 July in [[San Diego]] and ran to 21 September in [[Anaheim]].&lt;ref name="whatsnew" /&gt; Prior to the tour, Ant and his band appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' to promote the new album, performing a live version of the track Vince Taylor.

During early 2014, Ant was at work recording his next album, titled ''Bravest of the Brave''.&lt;!--A DRAFT ARTICLE FOR THIS EXISTS AT Draft:Bravest_of_the_Brave BUT DO NOT WIKILINK UNTIL IT IS CLEARED TO BE A PROPER ARTICLE--&gt;  On 19 April, Ant performed his debut album ''[[Dirk Wears White Sox]]'' at the [[Hammersmith Apollo]] with a band including former Ants Dave Barbe and Lee Gorman, preceding this with several UK tour dates.  He also reissued the Dirk album on white vinyl on his Blueblack Hussar label, with a launch party gig at the 100 CLub.  Both London concerts were filmed and later released as the DVD album ''Dirk Live At The Apollo''.  Ant subsequently performed the full album again with his regular band for four nights at the Islington Assembly Hall in November 2014 and a full UK tour in Spring 2015. [[Jack Bond (director)|Jack Bond]]'s documentary on Ant, ''The Blueblack Hussar'', covering his life and performances from late 2010 to mid 2011, was released on DVD in July 2014 by Sunrise Pictures.

Ant toured the UK in 2016 and North America in  early 2017, performing his ''[[Kings of the Wild Frontier]]'' album in its entirety. Sony Records issued a deluxe box set of the album linked to the UK leg of the tour, including a gold vinyl pressing of the album (as previously announced by Ant at the 100 Club gig in 2014).  After his January 24, 2017 show in Boston MA Ant's guitarist and music director, Tom Edwards, suddenly died due to suspected heart failure; he was 41.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/adam-ant-cancels-shows-guitarist-dies-1961201|title=Adam Ant cancels show due to death of guitarist|website=NME|language=en-UK|access-date=2019-07-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704225906/https://www.nme.com/news/music/adam-ant-cancels-shows-guitarist-dies-1961201|archive-date=4 July 2019|url-status=live|date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After cancelling shows in New York and Philadelphia, the tour continued.

On 25 June 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Adam Ant among hundreds of artists whose recordings were reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].&lt;ref name="Rosen2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190912084011/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |archive-date=12 September 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical style==
The tone of Ant's debut solo album, ''[[Friend or Foe (album)|Friend or Foe]]'', was defined as glitzy glam pop with "tongue-in-cheek tunes, delivered with an excess of flair and good humour". It was also described as being "one of Ant's best records and one of the best new wave albums".&lt;ref name="Friend or Foe"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=3 March 2009|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r749|pure_url=yes}}|website=AllMusic|title=Friend or Foe: Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review for ''[[Strip (Adam Ant album)|Strip]]'', the songs were considered to contain a "mixture of driving, danceable rock with humour".&lt;ref name="Strip"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=3 March 2009|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r750|pure_url=yes}}|title= Strip review |website=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music on ''[[Vive Le Rock]]'' has been said to be a "50s-style rock &amp; roll sound".&lt;ref name="Vive Le Rock"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=3 March 2009|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r28706|pure_url=yes}}|title=Vive Le Rock review |website= AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth studio album, ''[[Manners and Physique]]'', was said to be a combination of "contemporary dance tracks" and Ant's "old flair for mockery".&lt;ref name="Manners and Physique"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=3 March 2009|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r751|pure_url=yes}}|title=Manners &amp; Physique review |website=AllMusic }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ant himself later claimed that the album was styled after the bass heavy [[Minneapolis sound]] of which Cymone, in Ant's words, was "one of the architects".&lt;ref&gt;Antbook, packaged with Antbox, Sony Records 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Ant married Carol Mills in 1975 and they divorced in 1982. He dated [[Amanda Donohoe]] between 1977 and 1981, [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] in 1983 and [[Heather Graham]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; He featured a song about Vanity of Vanity 6, the female vocal group associated with Prince, on the ''Strip'' album. In 1997, Ant married Lorraine Gibson, a 25-year-old [[Public relations|PR]] assistant for [[Vivienne Westwood]]. The ceremony took place in [[Dayton, Tennessee]]. They divided their time between Dayton and London, and on April 10, 1998, the couple had a daughter, Lily Caitlin Goddard. However, the couple divorced soon afterwards.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Ant, who does not own a television, enjoys reading, particularly historical novels. He has tattoos depicting [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson's]] last prayer before the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], an image of his grandfather and a quotation from [[Oscar Wilde]]: "Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes."&lt;ref name=Reuters/&gt;

===Health===
At 21 years of age, he was diagnosed as having [[bipolar disorder]], and has spoken candidly about his experiences with the effects of the illness.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} In his 31 December 2010 interview for ''The Sun'', Ant also discussed the [[side effects]] of medication for his bipolar condition: "In the past I've been a robot. It's been an out-of-body experience. Bipolar means up and down and that's me... Music has always been the best medication. I was on [[sodium valproate]] for seven years.... I couldn't get to sleep and I didn't make love for seven years. My hair fell out and I couldn't pick up a book as I couldn't concentrate. I didn't write a song or pick up a guitar in that time – and piled on the weight. I might as well have been dead. I work very closely with my [[General practitioner|GP]] and any decisions I make are made with him".&lt;ref name="medicationhell"&gt;Adam Ant interview, ''The Sun'', 31 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/adam-ant-tells-of-medication-hell_1192117 |title=Adam Ant Tells of Medication Hell |website=Contactmusic.com |date=31 December 2010 |accessdate=11 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312044559/http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/adam-ant-tells-of-medication-hell_1192117 |archive-date=12 March 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview with [[BBC Radio 6 Music]], he declared that "mental health needs a great deal of attention. It's the final taboo and it needs to be faced and dealt with."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12546301 | work=BBC News | title=Adam Ant on fame, depression and infamy | date=23 February 2011 | access-date=20 June 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123151013/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12546301 | archive-date=23 November 2018 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ant is involved in the [[SANE (charity)#Black Dog campaign|Black Dog campaign]], which promotes better understanding of mental illness.&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/adam-ant-releases-first-album-in-18-years-1.4754570| url-status= dead| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130314035044/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/adam-ant-releases-first-album-in-18-years-1.4754570 |title= Adam Ant releases first album in 18 years| date= March 8, 2013 | agency= Reuters| work= Newsday.com |archivedate= 14 March 2013 | access-date= March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
