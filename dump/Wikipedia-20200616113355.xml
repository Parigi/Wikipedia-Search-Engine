The '''Hollywood Sign''' (formerly the '''Hollywoodland Sign''') is an American [[landmark]] and [[cultural icon]] overlooking [[Hollywood]], [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. It is situated on [[Mount Lee]], in the [[Hollywood Hills]] area of the [[Santa Monica Mountains]].

"HOLLYWOOD" is spelled out in {{convert|45|ft|m|1|adj=on}}-tall&lt;ref name=SignFacts&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hollywoodsign.org/fast-facts/ |title=Fast Facts About The Hollywood Sign |website=The Hollywood Sign |accessdate=January 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116170028/http://hollywoodsign.org/fast-facts/ |archive-date=January 16, 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; white capital letters and is 350 feet (106.7 m) long.&lt;ref name=SignFacts/&gt; The sign was originally created in 1923 as a temporary advertisement for a local [[real estate]] development, but due to increasing recognition, the sign was left up.&lt;ref name="hstpdf"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Hollywood Sign: A Beat-by-Beat Plotline |website=The Hollywood Sign |date=May 19, 2005 |url=http://www.hollywoodsign.org/pdf/HOLLYWOOD%20PLOTLINE.pdf |accessdate=August 12, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809185557/http://www.hollywoodsign.org/pdf/HOLLYWOOD%20PLOTLINE.pdf |archivedate=August 9, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sign has been a frequent target of pranks and vandalism across the decades, but it has since undergone restoration, including the installation of a security system to deter vandalism.

The sign makes frequent appearances in [[popular culture]], particularly in [[establishing shot]]s for films and television programs set in or around Hollywood. Signs of similar style, but spelling different words, are frequently seen as parodies. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce holds trademark rights to the Hollywood Sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://walkoffame.com/pages/licensing|title=Licensing for the Walk of Fame {{!}} Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=walkoffame.com|access-date=2019-02-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190203150442/http://walkoffame.com/pages/licensing|archive-date=February 3, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Origin ===
[[File:HOLLYWOODLAND 1923.jpg|thumb|left|Hollywoodland sign shortly after erection, 1923]]
The sign was erected in 1923 and originally read "HOLLYWOODLAND". Its purpose was to advertise the name of a new segregated housing development in the hills above the Hollywood district of Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Fodor's Southern California |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x4Y9DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT258#v=onepage |location= |publisher=[[Fodor's]] |page=258 |date=2017 |series=Fodor's Travel Guides |isbn=9780804143912 |access-date=August 30, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200429143523/https://books.google.com/books?id=x4Y9DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT258#v=onepage |archive-date=April 29, 2020 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H.J. Whitley]] had already used a sign to advertise his development Whitley Heights, which was between [[Highland Avenue (Los Angeles)|Highland Avenue]] and [[Vine Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Whitley |first1=Gaelyn |title=Let's Light Up the Sky! |url=https://www.thefatherofhollywood.com/hollywood-blog/75-let-s-light-up-the-sky#section-kmt |website=The Father Of Hollywood |accessdate=5 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322144010/https://www.thefatherofhollywood.com/hollywood-blog/75-let-s-light-up-the-sky#section-kmt |archive-date=March 22, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested to his friend [[Harry Chandler]], the owner of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' newspaper, and the lead investor in the syndicate that was developing Hollywoodland to make a similar sign to advertise their land. Chandler liked the suggestion and approved a plan to construct the sign.&lt;ref name="fatherofhollywood"&gt;{{cite book |last=Keith |first=Gaelyn Whitley |title=The Father of Hollywood |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nAgAv3duwZEC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=hollywood%20sign%20gaelyn%20keith&amp;pg=PA223#v=onepage&amp;q=hollywood%20sign%20gaelyn%20keith&amp;f=false |date=August 2010 |publisher=Tate Publishing |isbn=978-1-61663-475-9 |page=223 |access-date=November 12, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112185812/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nAgAv3duwZEC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=hollywood%20sign%20gaelyn%20keith&amp;pg=PA223#v=onepage&amp;q=hollywood%20sign%20gaelyn%20keith&amp;f=false |archive-date=November 12, 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;Let's Light Up the Sky!&lt;/ref&gt;
Real estate developers Woodruff and Shoults called their development "Hollywoodland" and advertised it as a "superb environment without excessive cost on the Hollywood side of the hills."&lt;ref name="BeachwoodWilliams"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beachwoodcanyon.org/HISTORY.htm |title=The Story of Hollywoodland |accessdate=April 27, 2010 |last=Williams |first=Gregory |website=Beachwood Canyon Neighborhood Association |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119055147/http://www.beachwoodcanyon.org/HISTORY.htm |archive-date=January 19, 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They contracted the Crescent Sign Company to erect thirteen south-facing letters on the hillside. The sign company owner, Thomas Fisk Goff (1890–1984), designed the sign. Each letter was {{convert|30|ft|m|1}} wide and {{convert|50|ft|m|1}} high, and the whole sign was studded with around 4,000 light bulbs. The sign flashed in segments: "HOLLY," "WOOD," and "LAND" lit up individually, and then the whole. Below the Hollywoodland sign was a searchlight to attract more attention. The poles that supported the sign were hauled to the site by mules. The project cost $21,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Horowitz |first=Joy |title=Signs and Wonders (review of ''The Hollywood Sign: Fantasy and Reality of an American Icon'' by Leo Braudy) |url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?type=&amp;id=381&amp;fulltext=1&amp;media= |journal=[[Los Angeles Review of Books]] |date=May 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419031929/http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?type=&amp;id=381&amp;fulltext=1&amp;media= |archivedate=April 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Inflation|US|21000|1923|r=-4|fmt=eq}}.

The sign was officially dedicated in 1923. It was intended only to last a year and a half,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodsign.org/the-history-of-the-sign/1923-a-sign-is-born/ |title=1923: A Sign Is Born |website=The Hollywood Sign |date= |accessdate=January 14, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231135601/http://www.hollywoodsign.org/the-history-of-the-sign/1923-a-sign-is-born/ |archive-date=December 31, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; but after the rise of [[Cinema of the United States|American cinema]] in Los Angeles during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]], the sign became an internationally recognized symbol and was left there.&lt;ref name="hollywoodhistoricphotos.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodhistoricphotos.com/index.php/cPath/90_103_145|title=Hollywood Historic Photos|website=hollywoodhistoricphotos.com|access-date=December 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208231443/http://hollywoodhistoricphotos.com/index.php/cPath/90_103_145|archive-date=December 8, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deterioration ===
{{more citations needed section|date= October 2014}}
[[File:Hullywod-Sign.jpg|thumb|right|In the 1970s, the sign reached its most [[Dilapidation|dilapidated]] state. This image was taken shortly before the sign's 1978 restoration.]]
Over the course of more than half a century, the sign, designed to stand for only 18 months, sustained extensive damage and deterioration.

The letter ''H'' was destroyed in the 1940s. According to one account, the sign's caretaker Albert Kothe, driving while intoxicated, was nearing the top of [[Mount Lee]] when he lost control of his vehicle and drove off the cliff directly behind the ''H''. While Kothe was not injured, his car and the letter ''H'' were both destroyed. The Hollywood Sign Trust disputes this story, and instead says that the ''H'' was felled by heavy winds in early 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hollywoodsign.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Hollywood-Sign-Brochure-FINAL_102918.pdf|title=The Saga of the Sign|author=Hollywood Sign Trust|date=October 29, 2018|access-date=November 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412112150/https://hollywoodsign.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Hollywood-Sign-Brochure-FINAL_102918.pdf|archive-date=April 12, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce began a contract with the City of Los Angeles Parks Department to repair and rebuild the sign. The contract stipulated that "LAND" be removed to spell "Hollywood" and reflect the district, not the "Hollywoodland" housing development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.daviesignarama.com/hollywoodsign |title=The Hollywood Sign |date=September 24, 2014 |website=Sign A Rama Davie |access-date=September 24, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003033531/http://www.daviesignarama.com/hollywoodsign/ |archive-date=October 3, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parks Department dictated that all subsequent illumination would be at the Chamber's expense, so the Chamber opted not to replace the lightbulbs. The 1949 effort gave it new life, but the sign's unprotected wood and sheet metal structure continued to deteriorate. By the 1970s, the first ''O'' had splintered and broken, resembling a lowercase ''u'', and the third ''O'' had fallen down completely, leaving the severely dilapidated sign reading "HuLLYWO D."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waterandpower.org:80/museum/Early_Views_of_Hollywood_(1920_+).html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524061523/http://waterandpower.org/museum/Early_Views_of_Hollywood_(1920_+).html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 24, 2017|title=Water and Power Associates|date=May 24, 2017|access-date=May 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hollywoodhistoricphotos.com"/&gt;

=== Suicide of Peg Entwistle ===
In September 1932, 24-year-old actress [[Peg Entwistle]] died by suicide by climbing a workman's ladder up to the top of the 'H' and jumping to her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1928&amp;dat=19320920&amp;id=9oApAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3051,5949013|title=Young Actress Ends Life In Hollywood|date=September 20, 1932|newspaper=[[The Lewiston Daily Sun]]|accessdate=May 13, 2014|page=11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200429143519/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1928&amp;dat=19320920&amp;id=9oApAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3051,5949013|archive-date=April 29, 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Peg Entwistle and the Hollywood Sign Suicide: A Biography|last=Zeruk|first=James, Jr.|publisher=McFarland|year=2013|isbn=978-0-786-47313-7|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Restoration ===
In 1978, in large part because of the public campaign to restore the landmark by [[Hugh Hefner]], founder of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, the Chamber set out to replace the severely deteriorated sign with a more permanent structure. Nine donors gave US$27,777.77 each (totaling US$249,999.93) to sponsor replacement letters, made of steel supported by steel columns on a concrete foundation (see [[#Donors|Donors]] section below).&lt;ref name="Braudy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Braudy |first=Leo |title=The Hollywood Sign: Fantasy and Reality of an American Icon (Icons of America) |year=2012 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-18145-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new letters were {{convert|45|ft|m|1}} tall and ranged from {{convert|31|to|39|ft|m|1}} wide. The new version of the sign was unveiled on November 11, 1978, as the culmination of a live [[CBS]] television special commemorating the 75th anniversary of Hollywood's incorporation as a city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19781111&amp;id=HIYsAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6093,2327201 |title=Sign Unveiled |newspaper=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]] |date=November 11, 1978 |access-date=April 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200429143514/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19781111&amp;id=HIYsAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6093,2327201 |archive-date=April 29, 2020 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Refurbishment, donated by Bay Cal Commercial Painting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baycal.com/hsrp/index.html |title=Hollywood Sign Restoration Project 2005 |accessdate=January 1, 2008 |website=Bay Cal Painting |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110024057/http://www.baycal.com/hsrp/index.html |archive-date=January 10, 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; began again in November 2005, as workers stripped the letters back to their metal base and repainted them white.

The original 1923 sign was presumed to have been destroyed until 2005, when it was put up for sale on eBay by producer/entrepreneur Dan Bliss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/11/17/news/newsmakers/hollywood_sign |title=Buy a piece of HOLLYWOOD |first=Jessica |last=Seid |website=CNN |date=November 17, 2005 |access-date=February 14, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012184248/http://money.cnn.com/2005/11/17/news/newsmakers/hollywood_sign/ |archive-date=October 12, 2007 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sold to artist [[Bill Mack (Sculptor)|Bill Mack]], who used the sheet metal as a medium to paint the likenesses of stars from the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://billmack.com/index.php?/hollywood_sign |title=Bill Mack's Hollywood Sign Project |accessdate=September 17, 2012 |website=Erin Taylor Editions |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423082100/http://billmack.com/index.php?%2Fhollywood_sign |archive-date=April 23, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Mack constructed an exact replica of the letter ''H'' from the metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2012/08/08/arts/minnesota-sculptor-restores-h-in-hollywood-sign/ |title=Minn. sculptor restores H |agency=Associated Press |date=August 8, 2012 |website=Minnesota Public Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 9, 2012, [[Herb Wesson]] and [[Tom LaBonge]] of the [[Los Angeles City Council]] presented Mack with a Certificate of Recognition for his restoration efforts and preservation of the sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/story/19243240/minneapolis-sculptor-unveils-original-h-from-hollywood-sign |title=Minneapolis sculptor unveils original H from Hollywood sign |website=KMSP-TV |date=August 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403034717/http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/story/19243240/minneapolis-sculptor-unveils-original-h-from-hollywood-sign |archivedate=April 3, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access controversy===
In recent years, considerable public controversy has arisen over certain access points to the trails leading to the sign that are in residential areas. Some residents of the neighborhoods adjoining the sign, such as [[Beachwood Canyon, Los Angeles|Beachwood Canyon]] and Lake Hollywood Estates, have expressed concerns about the congestion and traffic caused by tourists and sightseers attracted to the sign. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported in 2013 that "there are more than 40 tour companies running buses and vans in and out of the canyon..." and residents "...are most concerned about safety issues because the curving hillside roads were not designed for so many cars and pedestrians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-hollywood-sign-wars-20131009,0,2258306,full.story|title=Discontent brewing under the Hollywood sign|last=Pool|first=Bob|date=October 8, 2013|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=February 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013185422/http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-hollywood-sign-wars-20131009,0,2258306,full.story|archive-date=October 13, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-hollywood-sign-tourists-aggravate-residents-20131009,0,5716320.story|title=Hollywood sign tourists, sightseers annoy local residents|last=Pool|first=Bob|date=October 9, 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=February 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014224515/http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-hollywood-sign-tourists-aggravate-residents-20131009,0,5716320.story|archive-date=October 14, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Los Angeles Fire Department]] identifies Griffith Park, where the sign resides, as a high fire risk area due to the brush and dry climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beverlypress.com/2015/10/hollywood-sign-access-points-debated-at-town-hall-meeting/|title=Hollywood Sign access points debated at town hall meeting|date=2015-10-07|website=Park Labrea News/ Beverly Press|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616171757/http://beverlypress.com/2015/10/hollywood-sign-access-points-debated-at-town-hall-meeting/|archive-date=June 16, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local residents have created fake 'no access' and other misleading signs to discourage people from visiting the sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/mini-stories-volume-7/|title=Mini-Stories: Volume 7|website=99% Invisible|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221214816/https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/mini-stories-volume-7/|archive-date=December 21, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, at the behest of residents of the Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles City Councilman [[Tom LaBonge]] petitioned GPS manufacturers [[Garmin]] and [[Google Maps]] to redirect traffic away from residential streets, which lack the infrastructure (e.g. parking, restrooms, potable water) to deal with the large influx of tourists, towards two designated viewing areas, [[Griffith Observatory]] and the [[Hollywood and Highland Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.com/20120315/gps-directions-to-hollywood-sign-will-change|title=GPS directions to Hollywood sign will change|date=2012-03-15|website=Daily News|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702153506/http://www.dailynews.com/20120315/gps-directions-to-hollywood-sign-will-change|archive-date=July 2, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hollywood Sign Trust, the nonprofit that maintains the sign, also endorses these two viewing platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hollywoodsign.org/best-viewpoints/|title=Best Viewpoints|date=2017-06-20|website=The Hollywood Sign|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322135145/https://hollywoodsign.org/best-viewpoints/|archive-date=March 22, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other mapping services, such as [[Apple Maps]] and [[Bing Maps]], have subsequently followed suit.&lt;ref name="gizmodo.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/why-people-keep-trying-to-erase-the-hollywood-sign-from-1658084644|title=Why People Keep Trying to Erase the Hollywood Sign From Google Maps|website=Gizmodo|language=en-us|access-date=2019-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221214816/https://gizmodo.com/why-people-keep-trying-to-erase-the-hollywood-sign-from-1658084644|archive-date=December 21, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/mini-stories-volume-7/|title=Mini-Stories: Volume 7 - Page 2 of 4|website=99% Invisible|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221214816/https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/mini-stories-volume-7/|archive-date=December 21, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was considered deceptive by some, as the hike from Griffith Observatory could take up to two hours one way,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hikespeak.com/trails/griffith-observatory-to-hollywood-sign-hike/|title=Griffith Observatory to Hollywood Sign {{!}} Griffith Park {{!}} Hikespeak.com|website=www.hikespeak.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221214818/https://www.hikespeak.com/trails/griffith-observatory-to-hollywood-sign-hike/|archive-date=December 21, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both locations are considerably farther away from other viewing locations or trails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://la.curbed.com/2017/4/11/15232372/hollywood-sign-best-spots-views-hike|title=The 7 best places to see the Hollywood Sign|last=Chandler|first=Jenna|date=2017-04-11|website=Curbed LA|language=en|access-date=2019-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200103035739/https://la.curbed.com/2017/4/11/15232372/hollywood-sign-best-spots-views-hike|archive-date=January 3, 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmodo.com"/&gt;

In 2015, the city made the northern parts of Beachwood Canyon into preferential parking districts, restricting parking on most of the streets in the neighborhood to its homeowners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://la.curbed.com/2015/1/5/10005606/so-are-the-hollywood-sign-tourist-wars-over-now-1|title=So Are the Hollywood Sign Tourist Wars Over Now?|last=Kudler|first=Adrian Glick|date=2015-01-05|website=Curbed LA|language=en|access-date=2019-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221214818/https://la.curbed.com/2015/1/5/10005606/so-are-the-hollywood-sign-tourist-wars-over-now-1|archive-date=December 21, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Beachwood Drive gate, an access point to the popular Hollyridge Trail, was closed to the public by city officials.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-hollywood-sign-20170415-story.html|title=Hikers savor final days of access to popular trail near Hollywood sign as some locals protest closure|date=2017-04-16|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221214816/https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-hollywood-sign-20170415-story.html|archive-date=December 21, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is still accessible as an exit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beverlypress.com/2018/12/local-groups-continue-battle-over-griffith-park-gate/|title=Local groups continue battle over Griffith Park gate|date=2018-12-19|website=Park Labrea News/ Beverly Press|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221220321/https://beverlypress.com/2018/12/local-groups-continue-battle-over-griffith-park-gate/|archive-date=December 21, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event followed a lawsuit by Sunset Ranch Hollywood Stables against the city for advertising a gate at the bottom of the trail, which directed tourists towards the Ranch's "exclusive [[easement]] (right of way) road".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-hollywood-sign-legal-challenge-20170502-story.html|title=Groups mount legal battle over L.A.'s closure of the gate to the Hollywood sign|date=2017-05-02|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221214816/https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-hollywood-sign-legal-challenge-20170502-story.html|archive-date=December 21, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]] ruled that although the path was open to the public, the proliferation of its access by the city had interfered with the Ranch's business, thus the city was ordered to either provide access near the start of the easement or reopen a previously closed trail.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A spokesperson from the office of Councilman [[David Ryu]], who succeeded Tom Labonge, stated that it was uncertain that the city could have kept the gate open while complying with court orders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Backlash ====
Many public space advocates have contended the city should not restrict access points to the sign from the public, suggesting other avenues be explored to alleviate the challenges tourism presents to the surrounding communities. They have also argued the streets, sign, and parkland are public property and should be accessible to all since they are funded by public tax dollars.

The Friends of Griffith Park, Los Feliz Oaks Homeowners Association, and the Griffith J. Griffith Charitable Trust have filed a suit together to reverse the closing of the Beachwood Gate following its closure in 2017.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the court ruled in favor of Los Angeles and denied their 2018 appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://casetext.com/case/friends-of-griffith-park-v-city-of-la|title=Friends of Griffith Park v.

== Location ==
[[File:Hollywood sign from farmers market.jpg|thumb|View from [[West Hollywood]], near [[Santa Monica Boulevard]], a few blocks south of [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. The historic [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]] is visible on the left.]]
[[File:View towards Hollywood Sign and Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles.jpg|thumb|Hollywood Sign from [[Runyon Canyon Park]], [[San Gabriel Mountains]] in the background.]]
[[File:Hollywood sign hill view.jpg|thumb|A view of the back side of the sign from the top of the hill.]]

The sign is on the southern side of [[Mount Lee]] in [[Griffith Park]], north of the [[Mulholland Highway]], and to the south of the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)]] cemetery.

The sign is on rough, steep terrain, and there are barriers to prevent unauthorized access. In 2000, the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] installed a security system featuring motion detection and closed-circuit cameras. Any movement in the marked restricted areas triggers an alarm that notifies the police.&lt;ref name='Hollywoodsign.org 2009-08-2'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodsign.org/signsecurity.html |title=Sign Security |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |date=August 2, 2009 |website=The Hollywood Sign |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722024744/http://www.hollywoodsign.org/signsecurity.html |archivedate=July 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is at {{Coord|34|08|02.56|N|118|19|18.00|W|type:landmark_region:US_dim:20000}} at a {{convert|1578|ft|m|adj=on}} elevation.

Viewed from lower ground, the contours of the hills give the sign a wavy appearance. When viewed from the same height, the word appears nearly straight.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Surrounding land ===
The building and tower just behind and to the right of the sign is the City of Los Angeles Central Communications Facility, which supports all cellphone, microwave and radio towers used by the Los Angeles Police Department, the Fire Department, the Los Angeles Unified School District, and other municipal agencies. The building has no name and is a large maintenance building for the antennas. From 1939 to 1947, this site was the location of the studios and transmitter of the first television station in Los Angeles, W6XAO (now [[KCBS-TV]]), founded by The [[Don Lee Network]], hence the name [[Mount Lee]]. The TV studio left this location in 1948, and the transmission facility left in 1951, moving to the higher [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]].

[[File:Hollywood Sign February 2010.jpg|thumb|The sign in February 2010 during a donation drive raising money to preserve surrounding land.]]
Land in the vicinity of the sign was purchased by [[Howard Hughes]] in 1940, who planned to build a hilltop mansion at [[Cahuenga Peak]] for actress [[Ginger Rogers]]. Before long Rogers broke off their engagement and the lot remained empty. Hughes' estate sold the property that lies to the left and above the sign for $1.7&amp;nbsp;million in 2002 to Fox River Financial Resources, a Chicago developer that planned to build luxury mansions along the ridgeline.&lt;ref name=kabc /&gt; It put the property on the market in 2008 for $22&amp;nbsp;million. As a result, the City of Los Angeles considered buying it, possibly by raising money from celebrities as was done for the 1978 restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/nation/900498,hollywood041708.article |title=Chicago investors' sale puts famous Hollywood sign in jeopardy, residents say |agency=Associated Press |date=April 17, 2008 |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate=April 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815024016/http://www.suntimes.com/news/nation/900498%2Chollywood041708.article |archivedate=August 15, 2008 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmentalists and preservationists were concerned about the possibility of real estate development in the area. In April 2009 [[The Trust for Public Land]] (TPL) signed an option to buy the {{convert|138|acre|km2}} property for a discounted price of $12.5&amp;nbsp;million. On February 11, 2010, as part of a campaign to help raise money and with the full support of both the city and the Hollywood Sign Trust, the organization covered each letter of the sign with large banners reading "SAVE THE PEAK".&lt;ref name=kabc&gt;{{cite web |title=Preservation campaigners cover Hollywood sign |url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&amp;id=7272149 |date=February 11, 2010 |website=KABC-TV |accessdate=March 2, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629021900/http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news%2Flocal%2Flos_angeles&amp;id=7272149 |archive-date=June 29, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 26, 2010, the Trust for Public Land announced it had raised enough money, with ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine founder [[Hugh Hefner]] stepping forward to donate the final $900,000.&lt;ref name='Sign.org'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodsign.org/savethepeak.html |title=Original Benefactor Hugh Hefner Returns as Final Donor to Save Land Surrounding Hollywood Sign |accessdate=April 27, 2010 |date=April 26, 2010 |website=Hollywood Sign Trust, Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, and City of Los Angeles |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429000807/http://www.hollywoodsign.org/savethepeak.html |archivedate=April 29, 2010}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20120726000415/http://www.webcitation.org/5pJ0Cq5iA Archived version April 27, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; Hefner later gave an additional $100,000 donation. After the purchase, the parcel became an extension of nearby [[Griffith Park]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== Alterations ==
It is illegal to make unauthorized physical alterations to the sign. This is largely due to neighborhood opposition and to past accidents. Although the city has occasionally allowed it in the past for commercial purposes, current policy does not permit such changes to be made.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

The sign was illuminated as part of the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] held in Los Angeles.

*SAVE THE PEAK&amp;nbsp;– February 11, 2010, the original letters were covered with a series of large banners reading "SAVE THE PEAK", part of a campaign by [[The Trust for Public Land]] to protect the land around the Hollywood Sign from real estate development ''([[#Surrounding land|see above]])''. As the changeover progressed, variations such as "SALLYWOOD", "SOLLYWOOD", and "SAVETHEPOOD" sprung up.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Proposed ===
Disney filed to put spots on the sign as a means of promoting its film [[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|''101 Dalmatians'' (1996)]]; however, the request was later rescinded.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Depictions==

===Imitations===

The poster was intended as a jibe to the cost overruns and alleged overly elaborate design of the Parliament building, which the Conservatives opposed.
* In May 2008, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce licensed exclusive rights to [[Plymouth Rock Studios]] of [[Massachusetts]] to merge "Hollywood" with "East", creating [[Hollywood East]], a new industry trademark that represents the growing film industry in New England. The studio plans to find a site in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]] for the permanent installation of the sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.patriotledger.com/news/x1880507947/Iconic-Hollywood-sign-comes-east |title=Iconic Hollywood Sign Comes East |first=Tamara |last=Race |date=May 23, 2008 |newspaper=[[The Patriot Ledger]] |accessdate=November 16, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010035244/http://www.patriotledger.com/news/x1880507947/Iconic-Hollywood-sign-comes-east |archive-date=October 10, 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In March 2010, authorities announced the Wellington Airport in New Zealand would erect a ''[[Wellywood|WELLYWOOD]]'' sign on the hillside of the [[Miramar Peninsula]].

In films and television shows, the Hollywood Sign is often shown getting damaged or destroyed from the events of a particular scene; [[period piece]]s may show just the "LAND" portion of the original sign being destroyed. It is an example of national landmarks being destroyed, a common feature seen in many [[disaster movies]] to increase the drama and tension. It is frequently a shorthand device to indicate the destruction of all of Los Angeles or the state of California. The sign has been depicted getting destroyed in the movies ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'' (1974), ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'' (1996), ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'' (2004), ''[[10.5 (miniseries)|10.5]]'' (2004), ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' (2009), ''[[Sharknado]]'' (2013), ''[[San Andreas (film)|San Andreas]]'' (2015), and countless other films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://parade.com/51137/hannah_dreyfus/the-hollywood-sign-in-the-movies/ |title=The Hollywood Sign in the Movies |first=Hannah |last=Dreyfus |magazine=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]] |date=July 6, 2013 |access-date=February 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225052529/https://parade.com/51137/hannah_dreyfus/the-hollywood-sign-in-the-movies/ |archive-date=February 25, 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other movies came up with fictional explanations for the elimination of the original LAND part of the sign. 
* In the [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' franchise]], the Far Far Away Sign is based on the Hollywood Sign.
* In Matt Groening's ''[[The Simpsons]]'', the Springfield sign is based on the Hollywood sign.
* In the short-lived 1992 [[CBS]] game show, ''[[The Hollywood Game]]'', the bonus round has its own Hollywood Sign.
* In [[Steven Spielberg]]'s film ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'' (1979), the LAND part was shot down in an aerial dogfight over Los Angeles involving [[John Belushi]]'s character. 
* In [[Joe Johnston]]'s ''[[The Rocketeer (film)|The Rocketeer]]'' (1991), the character played by [[Timothy Dalton]] (a Hollywood star working for the Nazis) is about to exit a crashing zeppelin with faulty jetpack and his final words are, "I'll always miss Hollywood." He then jumps out of the zeppelin and crashes into the LAND part of the sign, destroying it.
* In an episode of ''[[BoJack Horseman]]'', BoJack steals the 'D' in a romantic gesture. For the rest of the series the D is missing and the area and film industry is referred to as 'HOLLYWOO' until the series finale, where it is turned into 'HOLLYWOOB'.
*The sign is featured in the video games ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' as "VINEWOOD".
*In the video game ''[[Far Cry 5]]'', the "YES" sign is based on the Hollywood sign
*[[Cherie Currie]] and [[Joan Jett]], as portrayed in ''[[The Runaways (2010 film)|The Runaways]]'', go up and sit on one of the letters of the sign.
