In October 1989, Steve Jobs gave a "View from the Top" lecture at Stanford Business School.

They ended up having dinner together that night.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} A year and a half later on March 18, 1991, they married in a ceremony at the [[Ahwahnee Hotel]] in [[Yosemite National Park]].&lt;ref name="Apple Confidential"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mXnw5tM8QRwC&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage|title=Apple Confidential 2.0: The Definitive History of the World's Most Colorful|author=Owen W.

On October 3, 2017, reports indicated Powell Jobs had purchased a stake in the [[Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment|ownership group Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment]] that includes the NBA's [[Washington Wizards]], NHL's [[Washington Capitals]], and [[Capital One Arena]].

==Philanthropy==

In 1997, Powell Jobs and [[Carlos Watson (journalist)|Carlos Watson]] co-founded College Track, a nonprofit organization in [[East Palo Alto, California|East Palo Alto]] to improve high school graduation, college enrollment, and college graduation rates for "underserved" students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/business/steve-jobss-widow-sets-philanthropy-goals.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 | title = Steve Jobs's Widow Steps Onto Philanthropic Stage | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = May 17, 2013 | accessdate = February 10, 2015 | author1 = Lattman, Peter | author2 = Miller, Claire Cain}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="College Track Vision"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Vision|url=https://collegetrack.org/where-we-work|publisher=College Track|accessdate=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Philanthropy&gt;{{cite news|last=Sparks|first=Evan|title=The Old College Try|url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/the_old_college_try|accessdate=October 12, 2011|newspaper=Philanthropy|date=Spring 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/07/28/who-is-laurene-powell-jobs-steve-wife-widow-atlantic-owner/|title=Laurene Powell Jobs: 5 Things About Steve Jobs' Widow &amp; New Owner Of 'The Atlantic'|last=Brow|first=Jason|date=2017-07-28|website=Hollywood Life|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Of College Track's high school graduates, many of whom are first-generation college students, approximately 90 percent attend four-year colleges and 70 percent finish college in six years, whereas the national average for first-generation college students is 24 percent.&lt;ref name="Philanthropy" /&gt; College Track has facilities in [[East Palo Alto, California|East Palo Alto]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[San Francisco]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]], [[Boyle Heights, Los Angeles|Boyle Heights]], [[New Orleans]], [[Aurora, Colorado]], [[Denver]], and the [[Washington, D.C.]], area.&lt;ref name="College Track Vision" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Philanthropy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Milken Institute"&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Global Conference Speakers|url=http://www.milkeninstitute.org/events/gcprogram.taf?function=bio&amp;EventID=gc13&amp;SPID=11719|accessdate=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-laurene-powell-jobs-program-in-watts-20151115-story.html| title=Laurene Powell Jobs launches college-support program in Watts| author=Howard Blume| date=November 15, 2015| newspaper=The Los Angeles Times| access-date=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We have a wait list of five cities where we'd like to open up centers," Powell Jobs has said. "We want to keep our standards high, though, and are reluctant to grow through franchising or through dissemination of our curriculum and training."&lt;ref name="Philanthropy" /&gt;

In 2004, Powell Jobs founded the [[Emerson Collective]], an organization that supports social entrepreneurs and organizations working in education and immigration reform, social justice, media and journalism and conservation through partnerships, grants and investments.&lt;ref name="Emerson Collective"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yahoo Finance"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/steve-jobs-widow-debuts-philanthropic-044821683.html|title=Steve Jobs' Widow Debuts Philanthropic|accessdate=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, Powell Jobs launched a $50 million project to create high schools with new approaches to education. Called XQ: The Super School Project, the initiative aims to inspire teams of educators, students, and community leaders to create and implement new plans for high schools. Efforts include altering school schedules, curriculums and technologies in order to replace the country's century-old high school education model. Funding for XQ comes from Powell Jobs' Emerson Collective.
