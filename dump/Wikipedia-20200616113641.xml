'''Universal Studios Hollywood''' is a [[film studio]] and [[Amusement park|theme park]] in the [[San Fernando Valley]] area of [[Los Angeles County, California]].  About 70% of the studio lies within the unincorporated [[county island]] known as [[Universal City, California|Universal City]] while the rest lies within the city limits of [[Los Angeles, California]]. It is one of the oldest and most famous Hollywood film studios still in use. Its official marketing headline is "The Entertainment Capital of LA".&lt;ref name="AboutUs" /&gt; It was initially created to offer tours of the real Universal Studios sets and is the first of many full-fledged [[Universal Parks &amp; Resorts|Universal Studios Theme Parks]] located across the world.

Outside the theme park, a new, all-digital facility near the [[Universal Pictures]] [[Universal Studios Lot|backlot]] was built in an effort to merge all of [[NBCUniversal]]'s West Coast operations into one area. As a result, the current home for [[KNBC]], [[KVEA]] and [[NBC News]] with [[Telemundo]] Los Angeles Bureaus with new digital facility is on the Universal lot formerly occupied by [[Technicolor SA]]. Universal City includes hotels Universal [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]] &amp; Towers, the [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] Universal Hotel, and [[Universal CityWalk]], which offers a collection of shops, restaurants, an 18-screen Universal Cinema and a seven-story IMAX theater. In 2017, the park hosted 9.056 million guests, ranking it 15th in the world and 9th among North American parks.&lt;ref name="2013 attendance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_268_653730_180517.pdf|title=TEA/AECOM Theme and Museum Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|year=2018|website=|publisher=[[Themed Entertainment Association]]|accessdate=May 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studio history==
{{See also|Universal Studios Lot}}

===The first studio tour===
From the beginning, Universal had offered tours of its studio. After [[Carl Laemmle]] opened Universal City on March 14, 1915, he later invited the general public to see all the action for an admission fee of just five cents, which also included a boxed lunch with chicken. There was also a chance to buy fresh produce, since then-rural Universal City was still in part a working farm. This original tour was discontinued around 1930, due to the advent of sound films and the stages being not sufficiently soundproofed.&lt;ref name="The Studio Tour - History"&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology &amp; History of Universal Studios Hollywood |url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/chronology.shtml |publisher=The Studio Tour |accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backlot fires===
Universal Studios Hollywood's [[Universal Studios Lot|backlot]] has been damaged by fire nine times throughout its history.&lt;ref name="The Studio Tour - Fires"&gt;{{cite web |title=Backlot Fires |url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/fires.shtml |publisher=The Studio Tour |accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first was in 1932 when embers from a nearby [[brush fire]] were blown toward the back lot causing four movie sets to be destroyed and resulting in over $100,000 damage.&lt;ref name="The Studio Tour - Fires - 1932"&gt;{{cite web |title=Actors Flee Blazing Movie Set |url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/fire_1932.shtml |publisher=The Studio Tour |accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen years later, in 1949, another brush fire caused the complete destruction of one building and damage to two others.&lt;ref name="The Studio Tour - Fires - 1949"&gt;{{cite news|title=Southland Fires Halted |url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/fire_1949.shtml |via=The Studio Tour|accessdate=July 9, 2010|publisher=Long Beach Independent|date=June 22, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, the New York street film studio set was destroyed by an arson fire causing half a million dollars in damage.&lt;ref name="The Studio Tour - Fires - 1957"&gt;{{cite web|title=1957 Backlot Fire |url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/fire_1957.shtml |publisher=The Studio Tour |accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, in 1967, twice as much damage was done when the Little Europe area and part of Spartacus Square was destroyed. It also destroyed the European, Denver and Laramie street sets.&lt;ref name="The Studio Tour - Fires - 1967"&gt;{{cite web |title=1967 Backlot Fire |url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/fire_1967.shtml |publisher=The Studio Tour |accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, the remaining portion of Spartacus Square was destroyed along with street sets and other buildings. As with the 1957 fire, this was suspected to be the result of an arsonist.&lt;ref name="The Studio Tour - Fires - 1987"&gt;{{cite web |title=1987 Backlot Fire |url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/fire_1987.shtml |publisher=The Studio Tour |accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just three years later, another deliberate fire was started in the back lot. The New York Street set, the [[Ben Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]] set and the majority of [[Courthouse Square]] were destroyed.&lt;ref name="The Studio Tour - Fires - 1990"&gt;{{cite web|title=1990 Backlot Fire |url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/fire_1990.shtml |publisher=The Studio Tour |accessdate=July 9, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412143620/http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/fire_1990.shtml |archivedate=April 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the seventh fire occurred at the back lot.&lt;ref name="The Studio Tour - Fires" /&gt; A portion of the Courthouse Square was again destroyed, though most survived.&lt;ref name="The Studio Tour - Fires - 1997"&gt;{{cite web |title=1997 Backlot Fire |url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/fire_1997.shtml |publisher=The Studio Tour |accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2008 fire====
{{main|2008 Universal Studios fire}}
[[File:Universal Fire Smoke.jpg|thumb|left|The Courthouse facade is visible to the left of the smoke plume from the 2008 fire.]]
The most damage was done on June 1, 2008 when a [[Multiple-alarm fire|three alarm fire]] broke out on the back lot of Universal Studios.&lt;ref name="NYT-20190611"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosen |first=Jody |title=The Day the Music Burned: It was the biggest disaster in the history of the music business — and almost nobody knew |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/magazine/universal-fire-master-recordings.html |date=June 11, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 11, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire started when a worker was using a blowtorch to warm asphalt shingles being applied to a facade.&lt;ref name="The Studio Tour - Fire - 2008"&gt;{{cite web |title=USH 2008 Fire |url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/wiki/index.php?title=USH_2008_Fire |publisher=The Studio Tour |accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/06/01/studio.fire/index.html |title=Universal Studios blaze burns sets, video vault |accessdate=2008-06-13 | work=CNN | date=June 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Los Angeles County Fire Department had reported that Brownstone Street, New York Street, New England Street, the King Kong attraction, some structures that make up Courthouse Square, and the Video Vault had burned down (not to be confused with the actual Film Vault; the Video Vault contains duplicates of Universal's film library). Aerial news footage captured the Courthouse building surviving fire for the third time in its history, with only the west side of it being slightly charred. Over 516 firefighters&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt; from various local fire departments, as well as two helicopters dropping water, had responded to the fire. Fourteen firefighters and three Los Angeles County sheriffs' deputies sustained minor injuries. The fire was put out after twelve hours, during which time firefighters encountered low water pressure.

Destroyed were 40,000 to 50,000 archived digital video and film copies chronicling Universal's movie and TV show history, dating back to the 1920s, including the films ''[[Knocked Up]]'' and ''[[Atonement (film)|Atonement]]'', the [[NBC]] series ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', and ''[[Miami Vice]]'', and [[CBS]]'s ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/us/01cnd-fire.html?ref=movies |title=Large Fire Strikes Universal Studio Lot |work=The New York Times |first=Michael |last=Cieply |date=June 1, 2008 |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ieKlEB60J43hDZ39AB9VmsPZ72sgD911MNN80  |first=Greg |last=Risling |via=Web Archive |title=Fire at Universal Studios destroys sets, videos |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080604141631/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ieKlEB60J43hDZ39AB9VmsPZ72sgD911MNN80 |archivedate=June 4, 2008 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns-ap-studio-fire,0,5322600.story |title=Universal studios fire may cost tens of millions |accessdate=2008-06-13 |first=Ryan |last=Nakashima |publisher=Web Archive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605022828/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns-ap-studio-fire%2C0%2C5322600.story |archivedate=June 5, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal president [[Ronald Meyer|Ron Meyer]] stated "Nothing irreplaceable was lost. We have duplicates of everything that was lost."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/universal-studios-fire-engulfs-sets-video-vault-king-kong-exhibit-1.734612|title=Universal Studios fire engulfs sets, video vault, King Kong exhibit|website=[[CBC.ca]]|date=June 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several days after the fire, it was reported that the King Kong attraction would not be rebuilt and would eventually be replaced by a new attraction that had yet to be announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url=http://travel.latimes.com/daily-deal-blog/index.php/universal-studios-hollywood-to-replace-king-kong-with-new-attraction-1977  |title=Universal Studios Hollywood to replace 'King Kong' with new attraction |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008, Universal changed its position and announced plans to rebuild the [[King Kong: 360 3-D|King Kong attraction]], basing the new attraction on the [[King Kong (2005 film)|2005 film adaptation]].

It emerged only in June 2019, in an article published by ''[[The New York Times]]'' that the fire had totally destroyed Building 6197, a warehouse adjoining the King Kong attraction, which housed a video vault and, significantly, a huge archive of analogue audio master tapes belonging to [[Universal Music Group]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20190611"/&gt; The collection included the master tape catalogues of various labels acquired by Universal over the years, including Chess, Decca, MCA, Geffen, Interscope, A&amp;M, Impulse, and a host of subsidiary labels.&lt;ref name="NYT-20190611"/&gt; Estimates of the individual items lost range from 118,000 to 175,000 album and 45rpm single master tapes, gramophone master discs, lacquers and acetates, as well as all the documentation contained in the tape boxes.&lt;ref name="NYT-20190611"/&gt; Many of the tapes destroyed contained unreleased recordings such as outtakes, alternate versions of released material, and instrumental 'submaster' multitracks created for subsequent dubbing and mixdown to the final master tape. Randy Aronson, who was manager of the vault at the time of the fire, estimates that as many as 500,000 individual song titles were lost.&lt;ref name="NYT-20190611"/&gt;

Among the losses were all of [[Decca Records|Decca]]'s masters from the 1930s to the 1950s and most of the original [[Chess Records|Chess]] masters which included artists such as [[Chuck Berry]], [[Otis Redding]], [[Muddy Waters]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]], and most of the [[John Coltrane]]'s master tapes from his later career on Impulse Records; the Chess, Coltrane and Impulse Records recordings were later confirmed to have survived.&lt;ref name="NYT-20190611"/&gt; In a statement issued on June 11, 2019, UMG disputed ''The New York Times'' article saying it contained "numerous inaccuracies", as well as "fundamental misunderstandings of the scope of the incident and affected assets," but was unable to publicly disclose details due to "constraints".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aswad|first=Jem|url=https://variety.com/2019/music/news/universal-music-disputes-severity-2008-vault-fire-new-york-times-1203239661/|title=Universal Music Disputes Severity of 2008 Fire Cited in New York Times Article|work=Variety|date=June 11, 2019|access-date=June 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of the ''New York Times'' story, [[Questlove]] of [[The Roots]] confirmed that the master tapes for two of the band's albums, including unused material and multi-track recordings, were lost in the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hole Say They Were Never Told About Lost Recordings in Warehouse Fire |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/hole-say-they-were-never-told-about-lost-recordings-in-warehouse-fire/ |website=Pitchfork |accessdate=12 June 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] bassist [[Krist Novoselic]] said he believed the masters for the band's 1991 album ''[[Nevermind]]'' were "gone forever" as a result of the fire.&lt;ref name="mourn"/&gt; Representatives for [[R.E.M.]] announced they would investigate the effects the fire may have had on the band's archival materials, while [[Hole (band)|Hole]], [[Steely Dan]], [[Rosanne Cash]] and [[Geoff Downes]] made statements on their possible losses from the fire.&lt;ref name="mourn"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Holson |first1=Laura M. |title=Musicians Mourn the Fiery Destruction of Their Recordings: ‘I Think They Are Gone Forever’ |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/us/universal-music-fire-musician-reactions.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=12 June 2019 |date=12 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Colburn |first1=Randall |title=Nirvana's Krist Novoselic believes Nevermind masters lost in Universal fire |url=https://news.avclub.com/nirvanas-krist-novoselic-believes-nevermind-masters-los-1835460110 |website=News |accessdate=12 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A representative for [[Eminem]] confirmed that the rapper's master recordings were digitized months before the fire, but did not confirm whether the physical master reels of his recordings were affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eminem Master Tapes Were Digitally Backed Up Just Months Before Universal Fire: Report |url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/record-labels/8515652/eminem-master-tapes-were-digitally-backed-up-just-months |website=Billboard |accessdate=12 June 2019 |date=12 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; UMG archivist Patrick Kraus assured that the [[Impulse Records]], [[John Coltrane]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Ahmad Jamal]], [[Nashboro Records]], and [[Chess Records]] masters survived the fire and were still in Universal's archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8516256/umg-archivist-interview-universal-fire-masters-tapes-litigation|title=Universal Music Group Archivist: Vault Fire Damage 'Surprisingly Overstated,' But Any Loss Is 'Painful for Us'|website=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Park history===
Shortly after [[Music Corporation of America]] took over Universal Pictures in 1962, accountants suggested a new tour in the studio commissary would increase profits. On July 15, 1964, the modern tour was established to include a series of dressing room walk-throughs, peeks at actual production, and later, staged events.&lt;ref name="The Studio Tour - History" /&gt; This grew over the years into a full-blown [[amusement park|theme park]]. The narrated tram tour (formerly "Glamor Trams"&lt;ref name="GlamourTrams"&gt;{{cite web |title=GlamourTrams|url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/studiotour/glamortrams.shtml |publisher=The Studio Tour |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) still runs through the studio's active [[backlot]], but the staged events, [[stunt]] demonstrations and high-tech rides overshadow the motion-picture production that once lured fans to Universal Studios Hollywood.&lt;ref name="The Studio Tour - History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Studio Tour History"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Studio Tour |url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/attractions/studiotour.shtml |publisher=The Studio Tour |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the War Lord Tower opened as one of the first attractions in the theme park. One of the early struggles for Universal was coming up with things for young children to do. The existing small Ma &amp; Pa Kettle Petting Zoo was expanded into the Ark Park. This area encompassed the Mt. Ararat petting zoo with over 200 animals and birds representing 30 species and a Noah's Nursery and a Noah's Love Inn playhouse for children and animals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=JayBangs: How Jay Stein, MCA, and Universal invented the Modern Theme Park and Beat Disney at Its Own Game|last=Gennawey|first=Sam|publisher=Theme Park Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1683900252|location=United States of America|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the opening of the Animal Actors' School Stage in 1970. In 1968, the Screen Actors Guild enacted a rule prohibiting visitors from most soundstages. This new rule, coupled with more productions being shot on location, meant the backlot tram tour could not show visitors much in the way of real movie and television production. Jay Stein, President of the Recreation Division, championed the idea of creating exciting experiences for visitors in place of viewing actual production. Later that same year, the Flash Flood set was opened and this first special-effects attraction proved to be a hit. 20,000 gallons of water rushed 200 feet down a narrow Mexican village street, uprooting an old tree and threatening to engulf the tram. The Parting of the Red Sea attraction opened in 1973.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 1974, the Rockslide staged event was added to the Studio Tour. The following year, The Land of a Thousand Faces opened on the Upper Lot. In 1979, the Battle of Galactica replaced Rockslide as a staged event on the Studio Tour.

The Flintstones Show opened, replacing the Star Trek Adventure. In 1991, [[E.T. Adventure]] opened as the park's first "dark ride," an industry term for an attraction that uses ride vehicles to take passengers through an indoor show building. Around the same time, sister park Universal Studios Florida opened, which had its own, similar E.T. attraction. The Florida version was more of a conventional theme park and paved the way for the Hollywood park's evolution. In 1993, [[Back to the Future: The Ride]] opened, replacing Battle of Galactica. In 1996, [[Jurassic Park: The Ride]] opened. In 1997, two shows were replaced: The Land Before Time show replaced Rocky and Bullwinkle Live; and Totally Nickelodeon replaced the Flintstones Show. Just one year after it opened, the Land Before Time show was replaced with Coke Soak. In 1999, [[T2-3D: Battle Across Time]] and a Chicken Run Walkthrough opened on the upper lot. Additionally, [[Beetlejuice's Rock and Roll Graveyard Revue]] was closed.

In 2000, the Rugrats Magic Adventure replaced Totally Nickelodeon. In 2001, the Nickelodeon Blast Zone opened. Also in 2001, Animal Planet Live replaced the Animal Actors' School Stage. In 2003, Universal Studios Hollywood closed [[E.T. Adventure]] to make way for [[Revenge of the Mummy]], which opened in 2004. The following year, Fear Factor Live replaced Spider-Man Rocks. In 2007, [[Universal's House of Horrors]] opened, replacing Van Helsing: Fortress Dracula. Both [[Back to the Future: The Ride]] and Lucy: A Tribute were closed, being replaced in 2008 by [[The Simpsons Ride]] and the Universal Story Museum respectively. Also in 2008, the Nickelodeon Blast Zone was re-branded to the Adventures of Curious George. In 2009, [[Creature from the Black Lagoon: The Musical]] replaced [[Fear Factor Live]] in the Upper Lot.

In 2010, the Special Effects Stages and Backdraft attractions were closed to make way for [[Transformers: The Ride 3D]], which was announced in 2008 (Special Effects Stages was moved to the former Creature From The Black Lagoon building and reopened as Special Effects Stage).&lt;ref name="Transformers LATimes announcement"/&gt; King Kong 360 3-D also opened.
