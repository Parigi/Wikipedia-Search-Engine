      <text bytes="60129" xml:space="preserve">This '''list of nonreligious Nobel laureates''' comprises laureates of the [[Nobel Prize]] who have self-identified as [[Atheism|atheist]], [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], [[freethought|freethinker]], or otherwise [[Irreligion|nonreligious]] at some point in their lives.&lt;ref name=Kimball&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kimball|first1=John|title=Physics Curiosities, Oddities, and Novelties|date=2015|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-7636-0|page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many of these laureates earlier identified with a religion. In an estimate by [[Baruch Shalev]], between 1901 and 2000, about 10.5% of all laureates, and 35% of those in literature, fall in this category.&lt;ref name="Shalev"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shalev|first1=Baruch Aba|title=100 years of Nobel prizes|date=2003|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors|isbn=9788126902781|location=New Delhi|pages=57&amp;ndash;61|chapter=Religion of Nobel prize winners}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same estimate, between 1901 and 2000, atheists, agnostics, and freethinkers won 8.9% of the prizes in  [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|medicine]], 7.1% in [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|chemistry]], 5.2% in [[Nobel Prize in Economics|economics]], 4.7% in [[Nobel Prize in Physics|physics]], and 3.6% in [[Nobel Peace Prize|peace]].&lt;ref name=Shalev/&gt; [[Alfred Nobel]] himself was an atheist later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evlanoff|first1=Michael|last2=Fluor|first2=Marjorie|title=Alfred Nobel: The Loneliest Millionaire|url=https://archive.org/details/alfrednobellonel00evla|url-access=registration|date=1969|publisher=W. Ritchie Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/alfrednobellonel00evla/page/88 88]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shalev's book lists many Jewish atheists, agnostics, and freethinkers as religiously Jewish. For example, [[Milton Friedman]], [[Roald Hoffmann]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[Élie Metchnikoff]], and [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]] are listed as religiously Jewish; however, while they were ethnically and perhaps culturally Jewish, they did not believe in a God and self-identified as [[Atheism|atheist]]s.&lt;ref name="Shalev" /&gt;
