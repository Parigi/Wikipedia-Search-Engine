'''Epigenetic theories of homosexuality''' concern the studies of changes in [[gene expression]] or cellular [[phenotype]] caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying [[DNA sequence]], and their role in the development of [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref name="Friberg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rice WR, Friberg U, Gavrilets S. 2013. Homosexuality via canalized sexual development: A testing protocol for a new epigenetic model. BioEssays 35: 343-368&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rice W. R., Friberg U., and Gavrilets S. 2016. Sexually antagonistic epigenetic marks that canalize sexually dimorphic development. Molecular Ecology 12: DOI: 10.1111/mec.13490&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Epigenetics]] examines the set of chemical reactions that switch parts of the [[genome]] on and off at strategic times and locations in the organism's [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. However, epigenetic theories tangle a multiplicity of initiating causes and of resulting final effects and will never lead to a single cause or a single result. Hence, any interpretation of such theories may not focus just one isolated reason of a multiplicity of causes or of effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/de/evolution/ausbildungskonzepte.html |title=Ausbildungskonzept "Integrated approaches to teach and study the role of evolution for the emergence of biological complexity" |access-date=2016-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701141625/https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/de/evolution/ausbildungskonzepte.html |archive-date=2017-07-01 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of affecting the organism's DNA sequence, non-genetic factors may cause the organism’s genes to express themselves differently. DNA in the human body is wrapped around [[histone]]s, which are [[protein]]s that package and order DNA into structural units. DNA and histone are covered with [[chemical tag]]s known as the [[epigenome]], which shapes the physical structure of the genome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/epigenetics/ "The Epigenome at a Glance."] Genetic Science Learning Center. The University of Utah, 2013. Web. 10 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It tightly wraps inactive genes on the DNA sequence making those genes unreadable while loosely wrapping active genes making them more expressive. The more tightly wrapped the gene, the less it will be expressed in the organism. These epigenetic tags react to stimuli presented from the outside world. It adjusts specific genes in the genome to respond to humans' rapidly changing environments. 
The idea of epigenetics and gene expression has been a theory applied to the origins of homosexuality in humans. One team of researchers examined the effects of [[epi-mark]]s buffering [[XY sex-determination system|XX]] [[fetus]]es and [[XY sex-determination system|XY]] fetuses from certain [[androgen]] exposure and used published data on fetal androgen signaling and [[gene regulation]] through non-genetic changes in DNA packaging to develop a new model for homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;Richards, Sabrina. [http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/33773/title/Can-Epigenetics-Explain-Homosexuality-/ "Can Epigenetics Explain Homosexuality?."] The Scientist. N.p., 1 Jan. 2013. Web. 13 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers found that stronger than average epi-marks, epigenomes that are wrapped tightly around the DNA sequence, convert [[sexual preference]] in individuals without altering [[genitalia]] or [[sexual identity]].&lt;ref&gt;"National Geographic Explains the Biology of Homosexuality." YouTube. YouTube, 04 Feb. 2009. Web. 13 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
This research gives support to the [[hypothesis]] that homosexuality stems from the under expression of certain genes on the DNA sequence involved with sexual preferences. This theory as well as other concepts involved with epi-marks, [[twin studies]], and fetal androgen signaling will be explored here.

== Epigenetic marks ==
{{details|Epigenetics}}

Epigenetic marks (epi-marks) are temporary "switches" that control how our genes are expressed during [[gestation]] and after birth. Moreover, epi-marks  are modifications of histone proteins.&lt;ref&gt;Ruthenburg, A., C. Allis, and J. Wysocka. "Methylation of Lysine 4 on Histone H3: Intricacy of Writing and Reading a Single Epigenetic Mark." Molecular Cell 25.1 (2007): 15-30. Print. {{pmid|17218268}} {{doi|10.1016/j.molcel.2006.12.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epigenetic marks are modifications of the [[methyl]] and [[acetyl]] groups that bind to DNA histones thereby changing how the proteins function and as a result, alter gene expression.&lt;ref&gt;Jablonka E and MJ Lamb (2010). Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In: M Pigliucci and GB Müller Evolution, the expanded synthesis&lt;/ref&gt; Epi-marks change how the histones function and as a result, influence the way genes are expressed.&lt;ref name="Friberg"&gt;William R. Rice, Friberg, Urban and Sergey Gavrilets. "Homosexuality as a Consequence of Epigenetically Canalized Sexual Development." The Quarterly Review of Biology 87.4 (2012): n. pag. Print. {{pmid|23397798}} {{doi|10.1086/668167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epigenetic marks promote normal [[sexual development]] during [[fetal development]]. However, they can be passed on to [[offspring]] through the process of [[mitosis]]. When they are transferred from one parent to an offspring of the opposite sex, it can contribute to an altered sexual development, thus leading to [[masculinization]] of female offspring and [[feminization (biology)|feminization]] of male offspring.&lt;ref name="LiveScience"&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/25431-gene-regulation-homosexuality.html "Gene Regulation May Explain How Homosexuality Flourishes."] LiveScience.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 12 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these epi-marks hold no consistency between individuals in regard to strength and variability.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== Twin studies ==

[[Identical twin]]s have identical DNA, which leads to the perceived conclusion that all identical twins are either [[heterosexual]] or homosexual. However, it is evident that this is not the case, consequently leaving a gap in the explanation for homosexuality. A "gay" gene does not produce homosexuality. Rather, epigenetic modifications act as temporary "switches" that regulate how the genes are expressed.&lt;ref name="LiveScience"/&gt; Of the pairs of identical twins in which one twin is homosexual, only twenty percent of the other twins are homosexual, which leads to the hypothesis that even though identical twins share the same DNA, homosexuality is created by something else rather than the genes. Epigenetic transformation allows the on and off switching of certain genes, subsequently shaping how cells respond to androgen signaling, which is critical in sexual development.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;
Another example of epigenetic consequences is evident in [[multiple sclerosis]] in [[monozygotic]] (identical) twins. There are pairs of twins that are discordant with multiple sclerosis and do not both show the trait. After [[gene testing]], it was suggested that DNA was identical and that epigenetic differences contributed to the gene difference between identical twins.&lt;ref&gt;Handunnetthi, Lahiru, Adam Handel, and Sreeram V. Ramagopalan. Contribution of Genetic, Epigenetic and Transcriptomic Differences to Twin Discordance in Multiple Sclerosis. Ebsco Host. Psyc Info, 2010. Web. {{pmid|20819009}} {{doi|10.1586/ern.10.116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of fetal androgen exposure ==

While in the fetal stages, hormonal influences of [[androgen]], specifically [[testosterone]], cause feminine qualities in regard to sexual development in females and masculine qualities in males. In typical sexual development, females are exposed to minimal amounts of testosterone, thus feminizing their sexual development, while males are typically exposed to high levels of testosterone, which masculinize their development. Epi-marks play a critical role in this development by acting as a buffer between the fetus and androgen exposure. Moreover, they predominantly protect XY fetuses from androgen underexposure while protecting XX fetuses from androgen overexposure.&lt;ref name="Friberg"/&gt; However, when androgen overexposure happens in XX fetuses, research suggests they can show masculinized behavior in comparison to females who undergo normal levels of androgen exposure. The research also suggests that excess androgen exposure in females led to reduced heterosexual interest in adulthood than did females with normal levels of androgen.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, Charles, Gerard S. Conway, and Melissa Hines. "Androgen and Psychosexual Development: Core Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation, and Recalled Childhood Gender Role Behavior in Women and Men with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)." Journal of Sex Research 41.1 (2004): 75-81. Online {{pmid|15216426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heritability ==

New epi-marks are usually produced with each generation, but these marks sometimes carry over between [[generation]]s. Sex-specific epi-marks are produced in early fetal development that protect each sex from the natural disparity in testosterone that occurs during later stages of fetal development. Different epi-marks protect different sex-specific traits from being masculinized or feminized—some affect the genitals, others affect sexual identity, and yet others affect sexual preference. However, when these epi-marks are transmitted across generations from fathers to daughters or mothers to sons, they may cause reversed effects, such as the feminization of some traits in sons and similarly a partial masculinization of daughters. Furthermore, the reversed effects of feminization and masculinization can lead to a reversed sexual preference. For example, sex-specific epi-marks normally prevent female fetuses from being masculinized through exposure of atypically high [[testosterone]], and vice versa for male fetuses. Sex-specific epi-marks are normally erased and not passed between generations. However, they can sometimes escape erasure and are then transferred from a father's genes to a daughter or from a mother's genes to a son. When this happens, this may lead to an altered sexual preference.&lt;ref name="Friberg"/&gt; Epi-marks normally protect parents from variation in sex hormone levels during fetal development, but can carry over across generations and subsequently lead to homosexuality in opposite-sex offspring. This demonstrates that [[gene coding]] for these epi-marks can spread in the population because they benefit the development and fitness of the parent but only rarely escape erasure, leading to same-sex sexual preference in offspring.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
