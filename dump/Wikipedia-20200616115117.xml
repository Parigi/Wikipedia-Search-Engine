'''San Gimignano''' ({{IPA-it|san dʒimiɲˈɲaːno}}) is a small [[Defensive wall|walled]] [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[hill town]] in the [[province of Siena]], [[Tuscany]], north-central Italy. Known as ''the Town of Fine Towers'', San Gimignano is famous for its [[medieval architecture]], unique in the preservation of about a dozen of its tower houses,&lt;ref&gt;The exact number is not a matter of agreement because many towers have been levelled to the same height as adjacent buildings. The number is given as "a dozen" (Strasser), 13 (Vantaggi) and 14 (UNESCO).&lt;/ref&gt; which, with its hilltop setting and encircling walls, form "an unforgettable skyline".&lt;ref name= UNESCO/&gt;   Within the walls, the well-preserved buildings include notable examples of both [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture]], with outstanding examples of [[Romanesque secular and domestic architecture|secular buildings]] as well as churches. The [[Palazzo Comunale, San Gimignano|Palazzo Comunale]], the [[Collegiate Church of San Gimignano|Collegiate Church]] and Church of Sant' Agostino contain frescos, including cycles dating from the 14th and 15th centuries.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; The "Historic Centre of San Gimignano" is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web |work=[[UNESCO]] |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/550 |title=Historic Centre of San Gimignano |access-date=5 September 2012 |date=3 December 2009 |publisher=[[World Heritage Centre]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The town also is known for [[saffron]], the Golden Ham, and its white wine, [[Vernaccia di San Gimignano]], produced from the ancient variety of [[Vernaccia]] grape which is grown on the sandstone hillsides of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tuscany-wine.com/vernaccia_di_san_gimignano_docg.htm |work=Tuscany Wine |access-date=11 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123073215/http://www.tuscany-wine.com/vernaccia_di_san_gimignano_docg.htm |archive-date=23 January 2018 |last=Wine |first=Rebecca |title=Vernaccia di San Gimignano DOCG}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vernaccia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seetuscany.com/food/vernac.htm |title=Vernaccia di San Gimignano |access-date=11 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120204059/http://www.seetuscany.com/food/vernac.htm |archive-date=20 November 2012 |work=See Tuscany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:San Gimignano - panoramio - cisko66.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The central Duomo Square]]
In the 3rd century BC a small [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] village stood on the site of San Gimignano.  Chroniclers Lupi, Coppi and Pecori relate that during the [[Catiline]] conspiracy against the [[Roman Republic]] in the 1st century, two patrician brothers, Muzio and Silvio, fled Rome for [[Valdelsa]] and built two castles, Mucchio and Silvia (now San Gimignano). The name of Silvia was changed to San Gimignano in 450 AD after Bishop [[Geminianus]], the Saint of Modena, intervened to spare the castle from destruction by the followers of [[Attila|Attila the Hun]].&lt;ref name=History/&gt;  As a result, a church was dedicated to the saint, and in the 6th and 7th centuries a walled village grew up around it, subsequently called the "Castle of San Gimignano" or Castle of the Forest because of the extensive woodland surrounding it. From 929 the town was ruled by the bishops of [[Volterra]].{{sfn|von der Haegen|Strasser|2001|pp=430-433}}

In the Middle Ages and the [[Renaissance]] era, it was a stopping point for [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[pilgrim]]s on their way to [[Rome]] and the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Vatican]], as it sits on the medieval [[Via Francigena]].&lt;ref name=History/&gt; The city's development was also improved by the trade of agricultural products from the fertile neighbouring hills, in particular [[saffron]], used in both cooking and dyeing cloth and [[Vernaccia]] wine, said to inspire popes and poets.&lt;ref name=vernaccia/&gt;{{sfn|von der Haegen|Strasser|2001|pp=430-433}}

In 1199, the city made itself independent of the bishops of [[Volterra]] and established a [[podestà]], and set about enriching the [[Medieval commune|commune]] with churches and public buildings.  However, the peace of the town was disturbed for the next two centuries by conflict between [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|the Guelphs and the Ghibellines]], and family rivalries within San Gimignano.{{sfn|von der Haegen|Strasser|2001|pp=430-433}} This resulted in competing families building [[Romanesque secular and domestic architecture#City houses and tower houses|tower houses]] of increasingly greater heights. Towards the end of the Medieval period, there were 72 tower houses in number, up to 70 metres (230 feet) tall. The rivalry was finally restrained when the local council ordained that no tower was to be taller than that adjacent to the [[Palazzo Comunale, San Gimignano|Palazzo Comunale]].{{sfn|von der Haegen|Strasser|2001|pp=430-433}}

While the official patron is Saint Geminianus, the town also honours [[Saint Fina]], known also as Seraphina and Serafina, who was born in San Gimignano 1238 and whose [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] is 12 March.  The [[Chapel of Santa Fina]] in the Collegiate Church houses her shrine and frescos by [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]].{{sfn|Vantaggi|1979|pp=41-50}} The house said to be her home still stands in the town.

On 8 May 1300, San Gimignano hosted [[Dante Alighieri]] in his role as ambassador of the Guelph League in Tuscany.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asangimignano.com/index.php?p=sangi_storia_storia&amp;l=eng |title=History of San Gimignano |access-date=11 September 2012 |work=Associazione Strutture Extralberghiere di San Gimignano}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city flourished until 1348, when it was struck by the [[Black Death]] that affected all of Europe, and about half the townsfolk died.{{sfn|von der Haegen|Strasser|2001|pp=430-433}} The town submitted to the rule of [[Florence]].  Initially, some Gothic palazzi were built in the Florentine style, and many of the towers were reduced to the height of the houses.{{sfn|von der Haegen|Strasser|2001|pp=430-433}} There was little subsequent development, and San Gimignano remained preserved in its medieval state until the 19th century, when its status as a touristic and artistic resort began to be recognised.

The city is on the ridge of a hill with its main axis being north/south. It is encircled by three walls and has at its highest point, to the west, the ruins of a fortress dismantled in the 16th century.  There are eight entrances into the city, set into the second wall, which dates from the 12th and 13th centuries.{{sfn|Vantaggi|1979|p=5}}{{sfn|Vantaggi|1979|p=6}} The main gates are Porta San Giovanni on the ridge extending south, Porta San Matteo to the north west and Porta S. Jacopo to the north east. The main streets are Via San Matteo and Via San Giovanni, which cross the city from north to south.
At the heart of the town are four squares: the Piazza Duomo, on which stands the Collegiate Church; the Piazza della Cisterna, the Piazza Pecori and the Piazza delle Erbe.  To the north of the town is another significant square, Piazza Agostino, on which stands the Church of Sant' Agostino. The locations of the Collegiate Church and Sant' Agostino's and their piazzas effectively divide the town into two regions.

==Main sights==
The town of San Gimignano has many  examples of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture]].  As well as churches and medieval fortifications, there are  examples of [[Romanesque secular and domestic architecture]] which may be distinguished from each other by their round and pointed arches, respectively.  A particular feature which is typical of the region of Siena is that the arches of openings are depressed, with doorways often having a second low arch set beneath a semi-circular or pointed arch. Both Romanesque and Gothic windows sometimes have a bifurcate form, with two openings divided by a stone mullion under a single arch.{{sfn|Vantaggi|1979|p=82}}{{sfn|Vantaggi|1979|p=83}}

===Squares===
====[[Piazza della Cisterna]]====
This Piazza, entered from Via San Giovanni, is the main square of the town.  It is triangular in shape and is surrounded by medieval houses of different dates, among them some fine examples of Romanesque and Gothic palazzos.  At the centre of the piazza stands a well which was the main source of water for the town's residents. The structure dates from 1346.{{sfn|von der Haegen|Strasser|2001|pp=430-433}} Although much of it has been renewed in the late 20th century, parts of the paving date from the 13th century.{{sfn|von der Haegen|Strasser|2001|pp=430-433}}

====Piazza Duomo====
This piazza is to the north of Piazza della Cisterna and is connected by a passage adjacent to an open loggia.  To the west, at the top of the square, stands the [[Collegiate Church of San Gimignano|Collegiate Church]], reached by a broad flight of steps.  The name of the square would seem to imply that this church was at one time a cathedral, but although it was perhaps planned, this was not the case. Other important buildings on the square include the [[Palazzo Comunale, San Gimignano|Palazzo Comunale]] and the Palazzo Podesta, the house of the mayor.  The Palazzo Podesta is distinguished by its huge arched loggia.

===Towers===
[[File:SanGimignanoPanorama7.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Towers in San Gimignano]]
[[File:Una torre - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Torre Grossa]]
While in other cities, such as [[Florence]], most or all of their towers have been brought down by wars, catastrophes, or [[urban renewal]], San Gimignano has managed to conserve fourteen towers of varying heights, for which it is known internationally.

The  [[Pieve di Santa Maria (Cèllole)|Pieve di Santa Maria]] at Cèllole, a village in the municipality, is an example of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] pleban{{typo help inline|reason=similar to plebean|date=November 2019}} church.

===Civic buildings===
The [[Palazzo Comunale (San Gimignano)|Communal Palace]], once seat of the [[podestà]], is currently home of the town gallery, with works by [[Pinturicchio]], [[Benozzo Gozzoli]], [[Filippino Lippi]], [[Domenico di Michelino]], [[Pier Francesco Fiorentino]] and others. From Dante's Hall in the palace, access may be made to a ''Maesta'' fresco by [[Lippo Memmi]], as well as the ''Torre del Podestà'' or ''[[Torre Grossa]]'', 1311, which stands {{convert|54|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name=DK/&gt;

==Culture==
San Gimignano is the birthplace of the poet [[Folgóre da San Gimignano|Folgore da San Gimignano]] (1270–1332).

A fictionalised version of San Gimignano is featured in [[E. M. Forster]]'s 1905 novel, ''[[Where Angels Fear to Tread]]'' as [[Monteriano]].

''[[Tea with Mussolini]]'', a 1999 drama about the plight of English and American expatriate women in Italy during [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|World War II]], was filmed in part in San Gimignano. The frescoes that the women save from being destroyed during the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)#Allied advance into Northern Italy|German Army's withdrawal]] are inside the Duomo, the town's main church.

[[Franco Zeffirelli]] used San Gimignano as a stand-in for the town of [[Assisi]] in his 1972 [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis of Assisi]] biopic ''[[Brother Sun, Sister Moon]]''. Most of the "Assisi" scenes were filmed here.

In the novel ''[[The Broker]]'' by [[John Grisham]], Joel Backman takes his second of three wives on vacation in Italy to keep her from divorcing him. They rent a 14th-century monastery near San Gimignano for a month.

[[M. C. Escher]]'s 1923 woodcut ''San Gimignano'' depicts the celebrated towers.

A 15th-century version of the town is featured in the 2009 video game ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kelly |first=Andy |title=Revisiting the renaissance with Assassin's Creed 2 |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/revisiting-the-renaissance-with-assassins-creed-2/ |date=9 March 2017 |access-date=24 May 2018 |magazine=[[PCGamer]] |publisher=[[Future US, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Municipal government==
[[File:Piazza del Duomo - San Gimignano.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Town Hall (''[[Palazzo Comunale, San Gimignano|Palazzo Comunale]]'') nearby the Duomo]]
San Gimignano is headed by a [[mayor#Italy|mayor]] (''{{lang|it|sindaco}}'') assisted by a legislative body, the ''{{lang|it|consiglio comunale}}'', and an executive body, the ''{{lang|it|giunta comunale}}''. Since 1995 the mayor and members of the ''{{lang|it|consiglio comunale}}'' are directly elected together by resident citizens, while from 1945 to 1995 the mayor was chosen by the legislative body. The ''{{lang|it|giunta comunale}}'' is chaired by the mayor, who appoints others members, called ''{{lang|it|[[assessor (Italy)|assessori]]}}''. The offices of the ''{{lang|it|comune}}'' are housed in a building usually called the ''{{lang|it|municipio}}'' or ''{{lang|it|palazzo comunale}}''.

Since 1995 the mayor of San Gimignano is directly elected by citizens, originally every four, then every five years. The current mayor is Andrea Marrucci ([[Democratic Party (Italy)|PD]]), elected on 26 May 2019 with the 70.3% of the votes.
