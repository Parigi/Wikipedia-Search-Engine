Replace "Jobs' birth parents, Joanne Simpson and Abdulfattah Jandali—a Syrian Muslim[24]" with "Jobs' birth parents, Joanne Simpson and Abdulfattah Jandali—a..." 

For encyclopedic reasons, it would seem that this is irrelevant information. Why is there no mention of Joanne Simpson's religion or nationality? Are these not important, or is there a reason why the Syrian/Muslim background of Job's father is considered more relevant than the background of his mother?

== Please Take Out the LSD Sentence ==

It is not needed because the very next "counter culture" quote relays the same information (taken from the same source).  Can I put every verifiable quote I want pertaining to Steve Jobs here?  I am not arguing the quote's truth but it's necessity and even destructiveness.  The names and ages of the kids (which I found easily) are likely not on the bio for the same reason and I won't be the one to change that.  I understand Wikipedia is not about censorship, so how about not censoring me in removing this quote?  I guess if this request is removed, I will start looking for valuable Steve Jobs info. to place before this quote.  Will you censor my additions...maybe some philanthropic editions?

I've corrected this. I took both the current photo of Steve (holding an iPhone 4) and the MacBook Air photo. That MacBook air photo was actually from the Macworld conference.

== Liver transplant controversy ==

I came to this page to learn a bit about the controversy surrounding Mr. Jobs' liver transplant.  Coming from a bioethics background, I expected to see something, but strangely the article is silent on the issue.  I don't think there needs to be much--and it needn't be a vicious notation--but at least one sentence related to the topic seems appropriate, in my opinion.  There's a nice article on the American Medical Association's web site that quotes noted bioethicist Art Caplan on the issue.  Here's the link: http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2009/07/27/prsa0727.htm. [[User:April.13.1743|April.13.1743]] ([[User talk:April.13.1743|talk]]) 23:15, 3 November 2010 (UTC)

It's a complicated, controversial issue and even the article you linked says Jobs did nothing wrong. It might be appropriate to use Jobs' transplant in an article about the transplant controversy, but not dealing with transplant controversy  in an article about Jobs.

Agreed, Jobs is NOT an inventor.  He really works with design teams and lays out "Requirements" which the engineers than go figure out how to do.
Stipulating requirements is not strictly speaking "inventing".  Invention has more to do with the hard science behind something.  Ex. Steve likes his devices to not show screws.  The engineers have to figure out how to construct something that is held together without any screws showing.  Steve didn't invent anything, he merely came out with some requirements. 19:15, 9 February 2011 (UTC)  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class="autosigned"&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:NathanielPoe|NathanielPoe]] ([[User talk:NathanielPoe|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/NathanielPoe|contribs]])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:Perhaps, but this doesn't mean we can change Wikipedia policy to adapt wording for one specific article. Regardless of what information is, Wikipedia has [[WP:BLP|a strict policy on biographies of living persons]] that any statements that are likely to be controversial must be backed up by [[WP:RS|reliable sources]]. Numerous sources state that he is an inventor, and while I'd be inclined to agree with you on the use of the word "technologist" instead, there isn't any published material that refers to him as such.

"currently goes to a disambiguation  page, which has nothing listed there for IT/computing technology, and will be confusing for readers." wtf? That doesn't mean the guy's an inventor ...

"What you're expressing is personal opinion. " Utter, utter, UTTER piffle. He hasn't invented anything. Matter of fact, of public record, quite clear and probably something he'd tell you himself. He is a salesman. I don't intend that in any pejorative sense, that's just what he is, as evidenced by what he does.
As an aside, I'm getting a bit sick of wikipedia being run by fanboys, agendists and generally 100-IQ defectives running round throwing indignant, "You can't say *that*!"s at anyone who doesn't entirely agree with them.  &lt;span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned"&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/207.229.10.203|207.229.10.203]] ([[User talk:207.229.10.203|talk]]) 19:37, 2 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Salesmanship &amp; reality distortion field ==

the article currently says that the reality distortion field is particularly evident in his keynote addresses. But the [[reality distortion field]] link says that the term was coined to describe his persuasiveness with developers working at Apple. So at a minimum, it should say "also evident" not "particularly evident", though since the whole thing is unsourced and is opinion it would probably be better to stick with facts such as he is considered to be a good salesman and pursuasive to developers, etc. [[Special:Contributions/96.224.167.176|96.224.167.176]] ([[User talk:96.224.167.176|talk]]) 05:31, 18 January 2011 (UTC)

== Typefaces, fonts ==

Also, while I'm here, in the address he gave at the Stanford graduation (and also in this article), he states that sitting in on a college class about calligraphy gave him the idea to include typefaces and fonts in the Macintosh (and it was about taking credit as shown by his accusing Microsoft of copying Apple), but since [[Xerox_Alto#Diffusion_and_evolution|he saw typefaces and fonts]] already implemented on the Alto at Xerox PARC, this story seems highly suspect. Charles Simonyi who invented WYSIWYG at PARC, and who went from Xerox to Microsoft [http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Shut_Up.txt&amp;characters=Charles%20Simonyi&amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&amp;detail=medium prior to seeing the Macintosh], has a much better claim on this particular piece history, and it seems wikipedia should contain the truth, not the reality distortion field. (actually, now that I think of it, this story was probably stitched together when [[Apple_Computer,_Inc._v._Microsoft_Corporation|Apple was sued by Xerox]]; that was his story and he's still sticking to it) Even if Jobs had sat in on a calligraphy class, you don't need to take calligraphy to grasp serif and sans serif, it's in ordinary typesetting; typesetting is not calligraphy, and the Mac included as a core element the same typesetting style features as the Alto and Bravo X, rather than including calligraphy (the only calligraphy was the iconic script "hello" screen. [[Special:Contributions/96.224.167.176|96.224.167.176]] ([[User talk:96.224.167.176|talk]]) 05:31, 18 January 2011 (UTC)
:I engaged in some speculation as to how the story more likely played out. I'm not advocating that the article contain speculation. I'm advocating that if the article is going to mention the "oh, I took a class in calligraphy without registering for it" story, then the article should also mention that Jobs visited Xerox and saw the technology there. Note the word Xerox appears only in a footnote to this article. How could this be? Perhaps locking the page is not enough to protect it from vandalism, eh?

== Ambiguous wording - just needs a couple simple changes ==

I was confused by "Jobs might have married Baez", at first thinking the writer is unsure if Jobs and Baez wed.  If the phrase were changed to "Jobs might '''otherwise''' have married Baez" I'd be less confused.  :)

I was also confused by the reference to Bill Clinton.  I think Jobs lent the '''motorcycle''' to Bill Clinton, but he might have lent the '''house''' to Clinton.  

Sorry to be a pain.  You guys do a great job.  Thanks.   [[User:Theresavalek|Theresavalek]] ([[User talk:Theresavalek|talk]]) 13:12, 18 January 2011 (UTC)

== Oddity ==

"In 1982, Jobs bought an apartment in The San Remo, an apartment building in New York City with a politically progressive reputation, where Demi Moore, Steven Spielberg, Steve Martin, and Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, daughter of Rita Hayworth, also had apartments. With the help of I.M. Pei, Jobs spent years renovating his apartment in the top two floors of the building's north tower, only to sell it almost two decades later to U2 frontman Bono. Jobs had never moved in.[78][79]"
:I'm not sure why this was included except that it is odd. This seems like a common buddhist practice of making a work of art, then destroying it to show how 'unattached' you are.

== Wealth ==

The wealth section of the article states that Apple does not partake in any philanthropic activity. Surely the company's contributions to (Product)RED render this point a falsity. What do others think? [[Special:Contributions/203.122.198.214|203.122.198.214]] ([[User talk:203.122.198.214|talk]]) 11:49, 7 March 2011 (UTC)
::Actually I think the entire section is a hack piece. It's entitled "wealth", but discusses little about Jobs wealth. It's mostly a one-sided attack on Jobs and titling it "Jobs' greed" would be more accurate. First, while it mentions Jobs may donate privately, it does so dismissively. Some people consider it immoral to discuss their charitable acts publicly or to use them to improve their image. Second, it appears to be taken for granted that companies must give to charity. It' s not so cut and dried. There are many who argue that companies are better to reinvest their earnings in products and employment and leave charity to shareholders. The section should be removed. [[User:BashBrannigan|BashBrannigan]] ([[User talk:BashBrannigan|talk]]) 23:55, 17 March 2011 (UTC)
:::Most of this section is undue weight given to a non-NPOV, with the underlying assumption that someone who has money must give to charity. And OR that sounds more like someone has spent quite some time to "dig up these facts". That he has been criticized for not giving as much as Bill Gates etc. is the maximum that the section can sustain, if that. To what extent this criticism is notable in terms of reliable sources is another question (i. e. did notable e.g. newspaper or magazine articles discuss the issue?). I came to this talk page after having been struck by the jolting break in continuity (of encyclopaedic style) of the article, which I had started to read for the first time. And I was going to start a discussion myself if I hadn't found it to be already taking place. So I whole-heartedly agree, and given that no contrary opinion has surfaced so far I will likely cut down the section. -- [[User:Nczempin|Nczempin]] ([[User talk:Nczempin|talk]]) 23:50, 26 March 2011 (UTC)
::::Okay, I cut it down to contain more facts and less interpretation. The last sentence about cutting down Apple's charity expenses is still somewhat questionable, as it is close to OR-synthesis: "SJ's charity is not on Gates' level, he also cut down Apple's donations, hence ...". That information more properly belongs to the Apple article; putting it here in SJ's article is tendentious. But the section is now not as bad as it was when I first looked at it. -- [[User:Nczempin|Nczempin]] ([[User talk:Nczempin|talk]]) 00:20, 27 March 2011 (UTC)

::::It should be noted that Bill Gates is giving away a (small) portion of his *personal* wealth, not money belonging to Microsoft. Many people rightfully feel that publicly traded companies should not donate to charity, because that money belongs to the shareholders, not all of whom are wealthy, and that it is up to wealthy shareholders to donate a portion of their dividends themselves. Also some shareholders might object to the specific charities that are chosen. (PS: I'm no fan of Steve Jobs, just trying to be fair.)

== Early years ==

In the documentary Triumph of the Nerds, Steve Jobs talks about his first computing experience, programming in BASIC at the age of ten (circa 1965). BASIC was developed at Dartmouth in 1964 and was probably not widespread by 1965. I'm curious as how Steve Jobs had access to such a computer at such an early age. If anybody here has the right resources, it would be nice to shed some light on that point in his life.

== Simpsons S20E07 ==

With Steve Jobs retirement in the media at the moment, out of curiosity I looked him up on Wiki. I am surprised that it is not mentioned in the "In popular culture" section that Jobs was parodied in an episode of the Simpsons. While no actual names or Apple trademarks were used, it is clear that much of the humour is lampooning Jobs and Apple Inc in the episode ''Mypods and Boomsticks.'' IMO it's worth adding.

== Salary ==

In the infobox it says that he earns $1 in salary per year. However, as far as I can tell, this only refers to his work at Apple Computer. Note that he also is a board member of The Walt Disney Company, for which he probably also earns money. Is there any US service similar to [http://www.ratsit.se/ Ratsit] which can be used for checking this? ([[User:Stefan2|Stefan2]] ([[User talk:Stefan2|talk]]) 20:15, 25 August 2011 (UTC))

::: Note that all four references explicitly refer to salary from '''Apple''' (e.g. "Apple again pays Jobs $1 salary"). Thus, they don't tell us anything about salary from other companies, so he may receive any amount of salary from any other company. In particular, he is presumably paid salary from Disney. ([[User:Stefan2|Stefan2]] ([[User talk:Stefan2|talk]]) 21:17, 4 September 2011 (UTC))
:::::It's all assumption on your part that he's paid a salary from someone besides Apple. Find a source for this, then feel free to add it to the article. [[User:BashBrannigan|BashBrannigan]] ([[User talk:BashBrannigan|talk]]) 23:45, 4 September 2011 (UTC)
The one making assumptions is obviously not me but you. The four sources state one thing (Jobs's total salary from one company, Apple Computer, is $1 per year). The Wikipedia article states a different thing (Jobs's total salary from all employers is $1 per year). Obviously, the former does not automatically imply the latter, so the Wikipedia statement is clearly unsourced. The number of sources is irrelevant -- as long as they state something different than what is stated on Wikipedia, the sources are useless. His total salary could be anything; from the four web sites we just know that it is '''at least''' $1, as opposed to '''exactly''' $1. ([[User:Stefan2|Stefan2]] ([[User talk:Stefan2|talk]]) 09:14, 8 September 2011 (UTC))

== Trim back Pixar content. ==

The intro has 346 words, with 102 words (nearly 30%) devoted to Jobs' connection with Pixar. That is way, way disproportionate to Pixar's importance in his biography. Moreover, his involvement with NeXT (fulltime work for more than a decade) is given less than one sentence. 

Because I don't know the editorial history of this article, I don't want to make these edits myself (stepping on toes, etc.), but I hope some of the more involved editors will try to improve the balance of coverage in the intro.

== Steve Jobs and gaming ==

I stumbled upon a [http://seanmalstrom.wordpress.com/2011/08/24/email-steve-jobs/ blog].

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Everyone knows the true reason why Steve Jobs resigned. Apple cannot compete with dedicated handheld gaming devices. What Apple fans are not familiar with is that Steve Jobs was an employee of Atari and received his business training from Atari’s main investor. The Apple II was designed around the video game ‘Break-Out’ which Wozniak essentially designed. Video games created the personal computer, not the other way around. In the same way, handheld video games created the handheld computers, not the other way around. And despite Steve Jobs’s origins in gaming, his success in media only comes from old media such as movies (Pixar) to music (iPod). Steve Jobs has had the same exact effect on video games as Bill Gates: none. Aside from providing computer hardware that can also play video games, the nature of video games has been unchanged and uninfluenced by Jobs.

“It is wise for Steve Jobs to exit his role in the company now when it is clear that he has failed for the second time  (the first time was in home game consoles, the second was handheld game consoles) to take over gaming. Steve Jobs has failed to surpass his original employer, Nolan Bushnell, in influence over video games.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

::I just read the balance of the thread and only now realize no one has explained this: the image is in all likelihood going to be deleted because the fair-use claim ("unique historic image") is faulty. The reason is that while the event may be historic, the image ''qua image'' is not. Really, unless ''the image itself'' is the subject of discussion or critical commentary in the article in which it appears, any claim of fair use is groundless. This is a useful test for deciding whether ''the image itself'' is historic, in which case a fair-use claim might be asserted, or whether only the event it commemorates is, in which case the claim is weak to vanishing.

{{hat|General complaint by IP editor about the article being semi-protected. Heap big smoke, no fire, and doesn't serve to improve the article.}}
While Jobs was a visionary and innovator, there wasn't much rules or restrictions in him bringing about the latest technology gadget or gizmo into the market.  Here we have Wikipedia and its over zealous administrators restricting the flow of information in nearly all their articles.  In most articles you see a semi-protection tag or edit tag, over minor issues like recent-ism, etc etc etc. Some editors have to asked permission in the discussion pages to edit the articles.  How ridiculous and innovative is that?  &lt;span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned"&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/138.217.154.242|138.217.154.242]] ([[User talk:138.217.154.242|talk]]) 04:43, 6 October 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

::: That is because when a significant story becomes headlines, there is often a large inflow of unregistered users showing up to a wiki article on the topic and they start vandalizing it en mass. By restricting edits to registered users, this adds stability to the article, particularly by preventing many vandalisms by anonymous users. Nothing ridiculous about that. — [[User:Imeriki al-Shimoni|&lt;span style="color:#60d;font-weight:bold;text-shadow:3px 3px 2px #aaa;"&gt;al-Shimoni&lt;/span&gt;]] ([[User talk:Imeriki al-Shimoni|talk]]) 04:51, 6 October 2011 (UTC)

: The page protection is to stop IP vandalism. Page protection is enforced due to a high amount of vandalism that the page received before or is foreseeable to receive. It is better for 1 or 2 IP editors to as to edit an article rather than dozens of IP vandals destroying the article. Those IP editors who really do wish to edit an article can always make themselves a Wikipedia account and edit even with page protection enforced. Administrators don't restrict the flow of information, regular non-admin editors make 90%+ of all edits you see on Wikipedia. Administrators are just here to enforce the rules and make decisive judgement if an issue was to arise. If you read one the 5 pillars of Wikipedia, you would understand that Wikipedia does not censor and welcomes new information to all of its articles as long as it is verifiable and properly referenced.

(trying not to use any policy-talk or anything else) Almost 300 edits to the article have been made since the announcement of his death. Multiply that number by about 4 to account for vandalism and subsequent reverting, and what you get is a virtually uneditable article (though it was uneditable enough without the vandalism). And I didn't even talk about the fact that the article has been semi-protected for years (as far as I can see, almost since 2006).

:: Then what is the point of having the watchlist function at the top right corner of the article page?

@Abishek:  SmartDave is right.  You are wrong.  According to your logic there should be a Sic (properly [&lt;i&gt;sic&lt;/i&gt;]) after each word.  You are wrong, Abishek.

"Sic" is Latin for "thus" and is used to indicate "Hey, this isn't my mistake! It was like that when I copied and pasted it."  You couldn't be more wrong, Abishek.

== Illness and death &amp; Memorials sections far too lengthy ==

{{edit semi-protected|answered=yes}}
The "Illness and death" and "Statements on Jobs' death" sections appear grossly out of proportion for the rest of the article, partly, one would imagine, due to the recency of his death and the fevered speculation about his health that preceded it.  Certainly, there's no reason to invest far more writing in covering his battle with cancer than his role in the founding of Apple. As to the memorials section, not even the entry for [[Winston Churchill]], a far more extensively memorialized individual, has this sort of extensive block-quoting.  Do we really need separate, detailed statements from the Prime Minister of Australia and the CEO of Nokia?  Ultimately, I would imagine, this will transform into a "Legacy" or "Technological and Cultural Influence" section.  For now, though, any objection to finding a proper weight to the overall article?

== Cause of death ==

I have again removed references to Steve Jobs' death as having been caused by pancreatic cancer as [[WP:V|unverifiable]]. I haven't found a single source that says his death was caused by pancreatic cancer. Certainly no source cited in the article says that explicitly (some say he died after a battle with pancreatic cancer, but that's not the same thing).

It's reasonably probable that he died of pancreatic cancer; however, reasonable probability is not the threshold for inclusion: [[WP:V|verifiability]] is. It's possible, for instance, that his cancer had metastasized and that his death was caused by the secondary cancer at the site of the metastasis. Certain types of chemotherapy also carry increased risk of heart attack. In short, we don't know what caused his death -- or, rather, no [[WP:V|reliable published source]] identifies a cause of death, so until one does, references to his having died from pancreatic cancer should continue to be removed.

:BBC is now [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15202484 reporting the cause of death as pancreatic cancer,] and it's been properly cited in the lede.

::Multiple independent sources explicitly identifying pancreatic cancer as the cause of death would be preferable. It is curious that amid all the coverage, this single BBC story is the only one that explicitly mentions pancreatic cancer as the cause of death. Not even the BBC's own obituary does.  I somehow doubt Jobs' family gave an exclusive to the BBC on his cause of death, and strongly suspect this is just a (sloppy) uncorroborated assumption on the part of the article's author that should have been challenged by the editor before it was published.

== Statements on Jobs' death ==

I was reading with some sadness today about the death of Steve. As I read this article I came across the &lt;nowiki&gt;===Statements on Jobs' death===&lt;/nowiki&gt; and noticed the order in which they had been placed; the US president, a man who's personally known Steve for decades, and then a person who has worked with Steve for years. I hate to say this but it seems to me that this order is (unintentionally) US hierarchy biased. I'd suggest that the order would be first Bill Gates, then Disney and then the US president. I know it seems trivial but it really struck me that Barack Obama's statement had been placed first when he likely knew Steve very little and probably [IMHO] doesn't even know what and Apple I is. To me, that seems to be giving undue bias to a political leader rather than the people who know him. Would we place Woz's words below the Presidents? Any thoughts?

I suggest adding a section called "Cultural Influence" (or similar).  Jobs arguably had a significant influence in world culture.  I don't propose that my initial version of the text for this section is adequate, but it could be used as a starting point.

Steve Jobs influenced the way the world perceives what it means to live in the computer age.  He was an icon for the personal computer during the period in which it was first introduced to the world at large.  For many, Jobs put a human face on the experience of living with the computer as a human tool.  He helped carry the transformation of the computer age into human life in a way that gave it meaning.

Iger is just a CEO appointed to run Disney, nothing else.  Let's include only TRULY relevant people here; relevant to Jobs and his life like Gates and others. 
&lt;!-- End request --&gt;
:You do know Jobs was more then the that Apple guy right? See [[Steve Jobs#Pixar and Disney]]. Iger is the CEO of Disney a company of which Jobs was the largest shareholder of and a member of the board of directors. Iger was also the person who patched up the relationship between Disney and Pixar/Jobs the problems of which lead to the ousting of the previous CEO, and managed to convince Jobs to let Disney buy out Pixar. In fact, if we ignore the deaths section there seems to be more discussion of Iger then of Gates. [[User:Nil Einne|Nil Einne]] ([[User talk:Nil Einne|talk]]) 11:05, 6 October 2011 (UTC)

:::Why remove Zuckerberg? His statement regarding Jobs' death is neither more nor less notable than Iger's. Or, for that matter, that of Russian President Medvyedev. The text of the statement doesn't need to appear in the article (and, last I looked, didn't), but I see no issue with mentioning its existence. --[[User:N5iln|Alan the Roving Ambassador (User:N5iln) ]] ([[User talk:N5iln|talk]]) 21:47, 7 October 2011 (UTC)
::::We need to limit who we list. We can't list Zuckerberg, and Sugar, and Medvedev, and the man who lives across the street from me. We only list people who worked closely and/or are associated directly with Jobs. Jobs was on Disney's board and was the largest shareholder in the company. Gates was considered to be one of Job's archrivas.

I recognize the association between Zuckerberg and Jobs as both being high-visibility persons in the technology industry.

:::::: Medvedev and Sugar are also notable, but don't belong on the list. The only argument at contention here is whether or not Zuckerberg is sufficiently linked to Jobs. The "technology business" is too broad, and I'm pretty sure every single notable technology executive has been quoted as saying something about Jobs' passing. I see no reason why Zuckerberg should be added, just like you see no reason why Zuckerberg should be removed. I'm afraid we're at a deadlock.

Jobs didn't invent tablet PCs, computers, mp3 players, etc...he took existing technologies, improved their design and usability, and marketed them brilliantly. He was a product designer at heart, not really an "inventor" in the traditional sense. He invested user experiences, not the tech itself. For better or worse, that matches Edison fairly well.

*He was a supporter of Make-A-Wish. One child wanted to meet him as his wish and Jobs answered that wish. http://www.wish.org/stories/hitech/computers/jason_steve_jobs  

On its facebook page, the Greater Bay Area Make-A-Wish says "Make-A-Wish mourns the loss of a visionary and friend. Thank you Steve Jobs for all the contributions you made to the world, and the generosity you demonstrated to Make-A-Wish. You made so many wish children's dreams a reality. We will miss you."  http://www.facebook.com/SFWish

He also made contributions to fighting AIDS in Africa (RED).  Bono made a statement as such
"As a founder of (Product)RED, I’d like to point out that Apple’s contribution to our fight against AIDS in Africa has been invaluable. Through the sale of (RED) products, Apple has been (RED)’s largest contributor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria – giving tens of millions of dollars that have transformed the lives of more than two million Africans through H.I.V. testing, treatment and counseling. This is serious and significant. And Apple’s involvement has encouraged other companies to step up.

Steve Jobs said when we first approached him about (RED), “There is nothing better than the chance to save lives.”

I’m proud to know him; he’s a poetic fellow, an artist and a businessman. Just because he’s been extremely busy, that doesn’t mean that he and his wife, Laurene, have not been thinking about these things. You don’t have to be a friend of his to know what a private person he is or that he doesn’t do things by halves."

http://www.intomobile.com/2011/09/06/u2s-bono-praises-steve-jobs-his-contribution-fighting-aids-africa/

The article needs to be changed to reflect these two items (hopefully by someone who is a better writer than me ;-) ).  While not on the level of other philanthropists, to state that Jobs did nothing is false.([[User:HMS Bellerophon|HMS Bellerophon]] ([[User talk:HMS Bellerophon|talk]]) 06:32, 9 October 2011 (UTC))

''[[User:Tree Falling In The Forest]]'' proposes swapping out the current infobox image ([[:File:Steve Jobs Headshot 2010-CROP.jpg]]) for [[:File:Steve Jobs WWDC07.jpg]]. I oppose this change because I think the head-and-shoulders headshot is more suitable for the infobox than a half-length, because the headshot is more recent, because the image quality of the headshot image is superior, and because ''[[User:Tree Falling In The Forest]]'''s rationale for the change -- that it is more flattering to the subject and more "respectful" -- is faulty and rooted in unencylopedic concerns.

::::::But if your objective is, as you said, to find a more flattering image -- a wholly unencylopedic motive, since this is Wikipedia and not Vogue -- why not reach back for a picture from twenty years ago?

::::::::The image we use should be the popular image of Steve Jobs. I don't believe that late picture does. That's what I mean when I say it should be "respectful" -- it should portray him in the way popular memory, and therefore history, will most closely remember him. That isn't as 80s Steve, or as thin and gaunt Steve, but as the guy who trumpeted the iMac, the iPod, and the iPhone. The Steve who was on the cover of magazines and who was able to be the face of Apple. Just because there are pictures of him from later doesn't mean that they're accurate to who he was. Plus, I'm going to be honest, I really hate the image with the white iPhone. The white balance is terrible, the phone is all blown out, the shape of the image is odd, it's a little too close, and the colors are a little off. Plus, all that stuff about him not looking right. I, like many others, look up to this guy.

He's also depicted holding a MacBook Air, and showing the Russian President his black iPhone 4, both of which I believe is more iconic/specific than the proposed photo, with a more general stage appearance.

:Maybe "flattering" is the wrong word, but if we've got two pictures, and he looks more like he did for a majority of the time he was in the public eye, the. We should choose that image. We should take a bit of pride in our work here. One image is taken from an odd angle, too close, and with him looking clearly away from the camera. The other looks more like a portrait of him, with him looking towards the camera, and looking like the Steve Jobs that most people remember. But, all that aside, I think I've got a compromise that will make everyone happy. Take a look at [[:File:Steve Jobs.jpg]]. If we crop it a little closer to his face (but not too close), it'll show him looking fairly normal to his memory, in focus, and overall nice. It's a good portrait.

== His death ==

Since Jobs death date has more views on wikipedia page view statistics (7 million) than at the deaths of Osama bin Laden and Michael Jacvkson which reportedly jammed wikipedia, is there a similar occurence for the death of Steve Jobs? If so, any sources?

:2 years is a long time in computing terms so what may have been a problem in the past may not be anymore (upgraded servers, improved software/code). More importantly, where are you getting more than MJ statistic? The MJ article had 8.68 million page views in the first 24 hours after his death [http://infodisiac.com/blog/2009/07/michael-jackson/] so if your 7 million is for the first 24 hours it's obviously less. More importantly the big issue with MJ was seemingly the 1+ million hits in the first hour [http://infodisiac.com/blog/2009/07/michael-jackson/] [http://dom.as/2009/06/26/embarrassment/] if the SJ views were more spread out this would likely have been less of a problem. Also the nature of MJ's death likely lead to a greater level of editing, even with protection, and editing tends to me much more server intensive then page views (although lots of people viewing a heavily edited article doesn't help I believe).

== Biological parents ==

It is not clear that Jandali was a "professor" at UNR though he is loosely referred to as such in some of the British cites, the weakest of which is the Financial Times blog [blogs.ft.com/the-world/2011/10/the-wrong-syrian-died/]. The short FT blog piece is long on hype and short on facts. 

This article from the Reno paper, probably more accurately, mentions that Jandali taught political science at UNR.[http://www.rgj.com/article/20111005/NEWS/111005069/Steve-Jobs-biological-father-who-lives-Reno-declines-comment-estranged-son-s-death] If he had been a professor, he would have had tenure. Clearly he did not and he does not mention that period of his life on LinkedIn [http://www.linkedin.com/pub/john-jandali/14/824/a23] except to mention his education at University of Wisconsin, Madison.

So I say take out the professor part because it is probably wrong and note that he goes by the name John now.

According to this article, which appears here [http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2005/12/guest_column_pr_1.php#comment-2666] and is no longer accessible at the Green Bay news source, Schiebel and Jandali married in December 1955, four months after her father's death and ten months after giving up their baby boy. Their daughter, Mona Simpson, was born in 1957; Schiebel and Jandali divorced in 1962, according to the Green Bay newspaper, which checked court records.

== Cause of death - cite request for one point ==

We now have confirmation that the cause of death was "respiratory arrest and a pancreatic tumor" per death certificate. But no confirmation that the respiratory arrest was a complication or result of the tumor, at this time. Right now for all we have in reliable sources, these could be completely independent and not cause-effect, although obviously the ''assumption'' is the respiratory arrest was due to the cancer. So we have to say he died of "A and B", not "A - a complication of B".

Once Apple stops using those pages for its home page, then it ''may'' be appropriate to add screenshots of those pages to this article. Note that I said "may" and ''not'' "will".

== Richard Stallman quote ==

I thought I'd throw in my 2 cents as someone who just read the article. The Stallman quote seems appropriate, but it seems to "hang" on its own and feels out of place. I would include it in the ''Public Recognition'' section (even if it is negative recognition).

I'd save the ''Criticism'' section to address other issues. Possible topics for a short list are:

• Lack of philanthropy as CEO of Apple Inc and personally.  
• Detractors of his management style (perhaps this could be in three sections: Apple 76-85. NeXT 85-96. Apple 97-11.
• Labour issues at companies partnered or subcontracted by Apple Inc.
• Environmental record at Apple Inc under Jobs' tenure.  
• Criticism of the Apple "ecosystem" fathered by Jobs and his Apple Execs.  
• Use and repeal of DRM media in the iTunes Store.

I am sure there are more. The trick is to be thorough, but not to give undue weight in the overall context of this article. Further, these issues have to be tied to Jobs and choices he made as CEO directly, otherwise they are probably better suited for the Apple Inc article.

Overall this is a very well written and well sourced piece, which is especially challenging since it is updated several times a day due to Jobs' recent passing. Well done to all of the contributors. [[User:Codymr|Codymr]] ([[User talk:Codymr|talk]]) 05:47, 11 October 2011 (UTC)

Realistically, the only item that deserves mention on the Criticism section of this page is his management style. Lack of philanthropy, Apple's environmental record, or RMS's rant are not in any way specific to Steve Jobs. The lack of philanthropy seems so out of place. I mean, Fred Phelps announced plans to picket the funeral, but no one is suggesting "lack of giving glory to god" as worth mentioning in the article. The Apple ecosystem and DRM in iTunes is a huge issue, but more appropriately addressed in an article dealing with Apple.

:::Fred Phelps' view, for example, is that of a tiny minority and as such doesn't merit inclusion at all.

:::Criticisms of Apple probably belong in the article on Apple, unless Jobs' direct role in instituting or directing the measures or policies criticized is established by published reports in reliable sources. In cases like the cancelling of Apple's philanthropic ventures shortly after Jobs' return, for example, the proximity of those two events might simply be noted -- provided, of course, the subject has received sufficient coverage in reliable sources to merit inclusion at all -- but attributing this change to Jobs personally requires adequate sourcing or else is [[WP:NOR|original research]].

== Jobs and Hare Krishna ==

The fact that Jobs visited a Hare Krishna temple for meals is now included in the article as there is a reference (his Commencement address on June 12, 2005 at Stanford). The same statement was added by someone earlier. Why was it removed? Because there was no reference? Even if authorized editors are allowed to edit, still, strictly speaking what is the guarantee (rigid proof) that authorized authors will write facts? It all boils down to faith. It may be ''reasonable faith'', but still it ''is'' faith. Then why are many people against religion. Why can't someone have reasonable faith there too?&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class="autosigned"&gt;—&amp;nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:59.95.51.252|59.95.51.252]] ([[User talk:59.95.51.252|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/59.95.51.252|contribs]]) 15:00, 14 April 2011‎ (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

== Far too many dissenting obituaries not to include response ==

After the initial rush of obituaries praising Jobs as a genius, a notable number of dissenting writeups have been published, criticizing him for:
: 1. Lack of philanthropy as both an individual and head of Apple
: 2. Insulting, rude, tyrannical ways - the term "fascist" has been used frequently
: 3. Apple's illegal and immoral conduct and policies, including:
:: 3.1 Its "Worldwide Loyalty Team," widely characterized as the "Apple Gestapo," known for its:
::: 3.1.1 Censorship of the press
::: 3.1.2 Illegal searches
::: 3.1.3 Legal threats and harassment
::: 3.1.4 Thuggish bullying
::: 3.1.5 Special relationship with police departments
:: 3.2 Censorship of content in the App Store, including:
::: 3.2.1 Pornography, except pornography from large distributors like Playboy
::: 3.2.2 LGBT apps
::: 3.2.3 Political satire and cartoons
::: 3.2.4 News outlets that have published sexual content, e.g. Germany's Stern and Bild
:::: 3.2.4.1 Including attempts to make these sources censor their own publications
::: 3.2.5 Political candidate apps
::: 3.2.6 Numerous controversial apps in multiple categories
::: 3.2.7 Apps not originally written in Appe-approved coding languages
:: 3.3 Media Manipulation, including:
::: 3.3.1 "Controlled Leaks" - intentional leaking of upcoming product information, with an emphasis on making sure not to leave paper trails to avoid scrutiny by the press and the SEC
::: 3.3.2 Forced shutdowns of numerous blogs
::: 3.3.3 Forced retractions from larger news sources
::: 3.3.4 Misinformation, willful deception, and open hostility relating to reports of Jobs' health issues
:: 3.4 Human rights violations, including:
::: 3.4.1 Use of child labor in manufacturing plants
::: 3.4.2 Sweatshop conditions in manufacturing plants
::: 3.4.3 Use of Foxconn as a manufacturer in particular
:: 3.5 Unjustifiable retail markups
:: 3.6 DRM restrictions and engineered limitations of consumer products
:: 3.7 Hindering open source development - Richard Stallman said, "I'm not glad he's dead, but I'm glad he's gone."
: 4. Denying the paternity of his daughter, denying his health complications

These things need addressing. Obviously they shouldn't dominate the article, because that'd be undue weight, but the level of criticism, especially considering that the man just died, is very notable.

:I agree. Even though many think it's sad that Jobs died &amp;ndash; the article cannot be overflowed with just everything ''good'' about him. Like you stated, we need to address the criticisms. Let's get started --&lt;span style="text-shadow:#808080 0.2em 0.2em 0.2em" class="texhtml"&gt;[[User:B.wilson|&lt;font color="red"&gt;Bryce&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/B.wilson|&lt;font color="blue"&gt;Wilson&lt;/font&gt;]] &amp;#124; [[User talk:B.wilson|&lt;font color="purple"&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;  04:50, 10 October 2011 (UTC)

:Just be sure everything is cited by a RS and not just some op-ed piece; also statements will have to be pretty solid to avoid possible legal ramifications. Additionally, it is important to separate Apple Computer from Steve Jobs in the criticisms. [[User:HammerFilmFan|HammerFilmFan]] ([[User talk:HammerFilmFan|talk]]) 06:16, 10 October 2011 (UTC)

:* Agree with above, a "criticisms" section is reasonable or better still, merging other significant views into the main text where relevant. But RS are needed and due weight is crucial, as others above had said. But encyclopedic, not due to a POV or an agenda. Endorse if done right.

Just to be clear... the list above are all things said in obituaries? Or are you just making that section title up? And, I think you'd better search George W Bush's wiki to see if it contains "fascist" before attempting to add it to Steve's. [[User:Matt Yohe|Matt Yohe]] ([[User talk:Matt Yohe|talk]]) 08:53, 13 October 2011 (UTC)

You should put these in Apples page. It's not really fair for you to put Foxconns alleged use of child labour(False) as a criticism of Steve Jobs. So a problem with a large manufacturer that manufactures parts for many other companies(such as Sony, IBM, Microsoft etc) is the fault of Steve Jobs? Thats not really a fair criticism to make. You should therefore add this criticism to Sonys,I BMS, Microsofts etc wiki page and their respective CEO's page.  &lt;span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned"&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/31.205.28.203|31.205.28.203]] ([[User talk:31.205.28.203|talk]]) 01:38, 14 October 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Philanthrophy section ==

I read the section a week or so ago and it didn't reflect well on him and now it.. does (main differences can be seen [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Steve_Jobs&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=454772802&amp;oldid=454767892 here]) However the sources for the new positives are a google answers page (I've honestly no idea on the reliablity or not of that source, it may be fine) and an interview in Playboy from 1985, well before the elimination of philanthrophic activities at Apple for example - did his attitude change over time? His/Apples work with Product Red seems fine (and presumably any critcism of the project would belong on the projects page anyway), but it looks a little as if his recent death and his popularity amongst sections of the public are leading to a little rose-tintedness.

:I agree that his death is most likely the reason for the additions to the section. But if the sources check out and its true, there's no reason to remove it. It's still a pretty small and mild section. [[User:LogicalFinance33|LogicalFinance33]] ([[User talk:LogicalFinance33|talk]]) 17:21, 14 October 2011 (UTC)

== Criticism ==

First off, I think Steve Jobs was a fantastic innovator and businessman and I'm truly sad to see him go.
However, for a complete Wiki article, the criticisms section does need to be expanded. Even before his death, he was used in medical ethics lectures as an example of dual-listing on the donor transplant list (getting himself listed twice). While this is currently considered legal, it is extremely controversial. More so, doctors have questioned why someone with cancer metastasized to the organ in question would receive the organ transplant with such a high chance of metastasis again. Therefore the second question would be, why was he so high up on the list, quite possibly above others that would normally receive it? (Normally organs go to people with better scores, people that are more likely to get better "use" out of the organ. With such a limited supply, it is the way it's done right now.) I don't have time to write this part of the article right now, as criticisms require even stricter standards in my opinion, but I hope someone else can.[[User:Hazmat2|The Haz]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Hazmat2|&lt;font color="black"&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; 03:45, 12 October 2011 (UTC)

::Wikipedia is exactly the place to note controversies surrounding a topic, in a controversies section. We're trying to achieve [[Wikipedia:NPOV|neutrality]] which means covering all sides without bias. If there isn't any controversy, then it shouldn't be included, but this article is somewhat biased at the moment and could use what people consider to be the other side of the story, adding to its neutrality, not taking away from it. To do this correctly, opinions should be avoided as much as possible of course, and many facts need to be referenced and included with non-judgmental language, but it's not impossible. It won't be easy.[[User:Hazmat2|The Haz]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Hazmat2|&lt;font color="black"&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; 19:18, 12 October 2011 (UTC)
:::Whether or not there's a controversy that ought to be discussed in the article depends on the depth and degree of coverage of the controversy, if indeed there is one, in reliable published sources. The appears to have been a handful of stories at the time of the transplant raising questions about possible queue-jumping, quickly followed by a few stories denying it. An admittedly cursory look the news coverage of Jobs' liver transplant turned up no references to dual listing, and whether dual listing in itself is controversial is not a reason to include a reference to it in the article unless Jobs' own putative dual listing generated controversy that received substantial coverage in reliable sources.

:::My impression is that the coverage appears to have been relatively minor, and in the full sweep of Jobs' life the matter was negligible. It might merit at most a brief mention in a short relative clause in the article's (single) sentence about the transplant, but it probably doesn't merit being mentioned at all.

:::[[WP:NPOV]] isn't about finding equal numbers of good and bad things to say about somebody, or hunting for controversies and criticism to balance praise. It's about including both praise and criticism in rough proportion to their prominence in reliable sources about the subject. See [[WP:WEIGHT]].

::::I'm sorry, I didn't mean to imply we needed to find bad things or equal amounts. What I meant was that if the controversy exists and has reputable sources &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; facts, it deserves a mention and one or two sentences is more than fine. I suppose I am exposed to the controversy more as it's mentioned at many ethics or transplant talks I've been to so it's something that in my eyes has been covered to a good extent. However, if reputable, written sources do not exist for the controversy, then no, of course it shouldn't be added to the article. If I get the chance later I'll see if I can dig some up around here as at least [[Arthur Caplan]] (considered a medical ethics expert by the field) has talked and I believe written about it. In the end though, it's not a big deal to me. I just felt that such a public figure should have a "complete" article. It has nothing to do with not liking him (as in fact I consider myself biased toward him, not against).
