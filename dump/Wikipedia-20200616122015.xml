[[Image:Statue-Augustus.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Augustus]], the first [[Roman emperor]]]]
The [[Roman emperor]]s were the rulers of the [[Roman Empire]] dating from the granting of the title of {{lang|la|[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]}} to [[Augustus|Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus]] by the [[Roman Senate]] in 27 BC, after major roles played by the populist dictator and military leader [[Julius Caesar]]. Augustus maintained a facade of Republican rule, rejecting monarchical titles but calling himself {{lang|la|[[princeps senatus]]}} (first man of the council)&lt;ref name = "Holland"&gt;Rubicon. Holland, T. Abacus, 978-0349115634&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|la|princeps civitatis}} (first citizen of the state). The title of Augustus was conferred on his successors to the imperial position. The style of government instituted by Augustus is called the [[Principate]] and continued until reforms by Diocletian. The modern word 'emperor' derives from the title {{lang|la|[[imperator]]}}, which was granted by an army to a successful general; during the initial phase of the empire, the title was generally used only by the {{lang|la|[[princeps]]}}. For example, Augustus' official name was ''Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus''.

The territory under command of the emperor had developed under the period of the [[Roman Republic]] as it invaded and occupied most of Europe and portions of northern Africa and western Asia. Under the republic, regions of the empire were ruled by provincial governors answerable to and authorised by the [[SPQR|Senate and People of Rome]]. During the republic, the chief magistrates of Rome were two [[Roman consul|consuls]] elected each year; consuls continued to be elected in the imperial period, but their authority was subservient to that of the emperor, and the election was controlled by the emperor. 

In the late 3rd century, after the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], [[Diocletian]] formalised and embellished the recent manner of imperial rule, establishing the so-called [[Dominate]] period of the Roman Empire. This was characterised by the explicit increase of authority in the person of the Emperor, and the use of the style {{lang|la|Dominus Noster}} ("Our Lord"). The rise of powerful [[Barbarian#"Barbarians" in classical Greco-Roman contexts|Barbarian tribes]] along the borders of the empire and the challenge they posed to defense of far-flung borders and unstable imperial succession led Diocletian to divide the administration geographically of the Empire in 286 with a co-Augustus. 

In 313, [[Constantine the Great]], the first Christian emperor, issued the [[Edict of Milan]] along with [[Licinius]] that granted freedom in the worship of [[Christianity]]. In 330, he established a second capital in [[Byzantium]], which he renamed [[Constantinople]]. For most of the period from 286 to 480, there was more than one recognised senior emperor, with the division usually based in geographic terms. This division was consistently in place after the death of [[Theodosius I]] in 395, which historians have dated as the division between the [[Western Roman Empire]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Chester G. Starr, ''A History of the Ancient World, Second Edition.'' [[Oxford University Press]], 1974. pp. 670–678.&lt;/ref&gt; However, formally the Empire remained a single polity, with separate co-emperors in the separate courts. The [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], and so the end of a separate list of emperors below, is dated either from the {{lang|la|de facto}} date of 476 when [[Romulus Augustulus]] was deposed by the Germanic [[Herules|Herulians]] led by  [[Odoacer]] or the {{lang|la|de jure}} date of 480, on the death of [[Julius Nepos]], when Eastern Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] ended recognition of a separate Western court. In the period that followed, the Empire is usually treated by historians as the [[Byzantine Empire]] governed by the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperors]], although this designation is not used universally, and continues to be a subject of specialist debate today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704615504576172512424600444|title=The Glories of Byzantium|last=Herrin|first=Judith|date=2011-03-12|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 7th century reign of [[Heraclius]], the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]] saw much of Rome's eastern territory lost to the [[Sasanian Empire]], recovered by Heraclius, and then lost permanently to [[Spread of Islam|Arab Muslim conquests]] after the death of [[Muhammad]] and establishment of [[Islam]]. The Sasanian Empire was [[Muslim conquest of Persia|conquered]] by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], ending the [[Byzantine–Sasanian wars|Byzantine-Sasanian Wars]].

The line of emperors continued until the death of [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] during the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, when the remaining territories were captured by the [[Ottoman Empire]] under [[Mehmed II]].&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, [title?], p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ottoman dynasty]] carried on using the title of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar of Rome]].

Counting all individuals to have possessed the full imperial title, including those who did not technically rule in their own right (e.g. co-emperors or minors during regencies), this list contains '''196''' emperors and '''4''' ruling empresses, for a total of '''202''' monarchs.

==Legitimacy==
{{About|legitimate Roman emperors|other individuals claiming the title of Emperor|List of Roman usurpers}}
The emperors listed in this article are those generally agreed to have been 'legitimate' emperors, and who appear in published regnal lists.&lt;ref name = Lee&gt;Lee, pp. 163&amp;ndash;164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Gold&gt;Goldsworthy, pp. 425&amp;ndash;440&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Breeze&gt;Breeze &amp; Dobson, pp. 251&amp;ndash;255&lt;/ref&gt; The word 'legitimate' is used by most authors, but usually without clear definition, perhaps not surprisingly, since the emperorship was itself rather vaguely defined legally. In Augustus' original formulation, the ''princeps'' was selected by either the Senate or "the people" of Rome, but quite quickly the legions became an acknowledged stand-in for "the people." A person could be proclaimed as emperor by their troops or by "the mob" in the street, but in theory needed to be confirmed by the Senate. The coercion that frequently resulted was implied in this formulation. Furthermore, a sitting emperor was empowered to name a successor and take him on as apprentice in government and in that case the Senate had no role to play, although it sometimes did when a successor lacked the power to inhibit bids by rival claimants. By the medieval (or Byzantine) period, the very definition of the Senate became vague as well, adding to the complication.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Henry, ''The Birth of the Middle Ages'' Clarendon Press (London) 1935; Folio Society reprint (London) 1998; pp. 24-28, 281-284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lists of legitimate emperors are therefore partly influenced by the subjective views of those compiling them, and also partly by historical convention. Many of the 'legitimate' emperors listed here acceded to the position by usurpation, and many 'illegitimate' claimants had a legitimate claim to the position. Historically{{By whom|date=August 2018}}, the following criteria have been used to derive emperor lists:
* Any individual who undisputedly ruled the whole Empire, ''at some point'', is a 'legitimate emperor'(1).
* Any individual who was nominated as heir ''or'' co-emperor by a legitimate emperor (1), and who succeeded to rule ''in his own right'', is a legitimate emperor (2).
* Where there were multiple claimants, and none were legitimate heirs, the claimant accepted by the [[Roman Senate]] as emperor is the legitimate emperor (3), at least during the [[Principate]].

So for instance, [[Aurelian]], though acceding to the throne by usurpation, was the sole and undisputed monarch between 270 and 275, and thus was a legitimate emperor. Gallienus, though not in control of the whole Empire, and plagued by other claimants, was the legitimate heir of (the legitimate emperor) [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]]. [[Claudius Gothicus]], though acceding illegally, and not in control of the whole Empire, was the only claimant accepted by the Senate, and thus, for his reign, was the legitimate emperor. Equally, during the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], all claimants, though not undisputed, were at some point accepted by the Senate and are thus included; conversely, during the [[Year of the Five Emperors]] neither [[Pescennius Niger]] nor [[Clodius Albinus]] were accepted by the Senate, and are thus not included. There are a few examples where individuals were made co-emperor, but never wielded power in their own right (typically the child of an emperor); these emperors are legitimate, but are not included in regnal lists, and in this article are listed together with the senior emperor.

===Emperors after 395===
After 395, the list of emperors in the East is based on the same general criteria, with the exception that the emperor only had to be in undisputed control of the Eastern part of the empire, or be the legitimate heir of the Eastern emperor.

The situation in the West is more complex. Throughout the final years of the Western Empire (395&amp;ndash;480) the Eastern emperor was considered the senior emperor, and a Western emperor was only legitimate if recognized as such by the Eastern emperor. Furthermore, after 455 the Western emperor ceased to be a relevant figure and there was sometimes no claimant at all. For the sake of historical completeness, all Western Emperors after 455 are included in this list, even if they were not recognized by the Eastern Empire;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_lateemps.htm|title=Roman Emperors After Theodosius I|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of these technically illegitimate emperors are included in regnal lists, while others are not. For instance, [[Romulus Augustulus]] was technically a usurper who ruled only the Italian peninsula and was never legally recognized. However, he was traditionally considered the "last Roman Emperor" by 18th and 19th century western scholars and his overthrow by [[Odoacer]] used as the marking point between historical epochs, and as such he is usually included in regnal lists. However, modern scholarship has confirmed that Romulus Augustulus' predecessor, [[Julius Nepos]] continued to rule as emperor in the other Western holdings and as a figurehead for Odoacer's rule in Italy until Nepos' death in 480. Since the question of what constitutes an emperor can be ambiguous, and dating the "fall of the Western Empire" arbitrary, this list includes details of both figures.

===284–364: Tetrarchy and Constantinian dynasty===
{{Main article|Tetrarchy|Constantinian dynasty}}
Note: To maintain control and improve administration, various schemes to divide the work of the Roman Emperor by sharing it between individuals were tried after 285. The "Tetrarchy" proclaimed by Diocletian in 293 split the empire into two halves each to be ruled separately by two emperors, a senior "Augustus", and a junior "Caesar".
