The '''Holy Roman Emperor''', officially the '''Emperor of the Romans''' ({{lang-la|Imperator Romanorum}}), and also the '''German-Roman Emperor'''&lt;ref name="German-Roman"/&gt; ({{lang-de|Römisch-deutscher Kaiser|lit|Roman-German emperor}}), was the ruler of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Empire was considered by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] to be the only [[Translatio imperii|legal successor]] of the [[Roman Empire]] during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[early modern period]]. The title was held in conjunction with the title of [[King of Italy]] (''Rex Italiae'') from the 8th to the 16th century, and, almost without interruption, with the title of [[King of Germany]] (''Rex Teutonicorum'', lit. 'King of the Germans') throughout the 12th to 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hamish Wilson, ''The Holy Roman Empire, 1495–1806'', MacMillan Press 1999, London, p. 2.

In theory and diplomacy, the Emperors were considered ''[[primus inter pares]]'', regarded as first among equals among other Roman Catholic monarchs across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Terry Breverton]]|title=Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About the Tudors but Were Afraid to Ask|publisher=[[Amberley Publishing]]|year=2014|page=104|ISBN=9781445638454|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bQ4yAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP36&amp;dq=%22catholic+church%22+%22holy+roman+empire%22+%22successor+of+the+roman+empire%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22catholic%20church%22%20%22holy%20roman%20empire%22%20%22successor%20of%20the%20roman%20empire%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, an emperor was only as strong as his army and alliances, including marriage alliances, made him.

From an [[autocracy]] in [[Carolingian]] times (AD 800&amp;ndash;924) the title by the 13th century evolved into an [[elective monarchy]], with the Emperor chosen by the [[Prince-Elector]]s.
Various royal houses of Europe, at different times, became ''de facto'' hereditary holders of the title, notably the [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonians]] (962&amp;ndash;1024) and the [[Salian dynasty|Salians]] (1027&amp;ndash;1125). Following the late medieval [[Interregnum (Holy Roman Empire)|crisis of government]], the [[Habsburg]]s kept possession of the title without interruption from 1440&amp;ndash;1740. The final emperors were from the [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine]], from 1765&amp;ndash;1806. The Holy Roman Empire was dissolved by [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], after a devastating defeat to [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]].

The Emperor was widely perceived to rule by [[divine right of kings|divine right]], though he often contradicted or rivaled the [[Pope]], most notably during the [[Investiture controversy]]. The Holy Roman Empire never had an [[empress regnant]], though women such as [[Theophanu]] and [[Maria Theresa]] exerted strong influence. Throughout its history, the position was viewed as a defender of the Roman Catholic faith.  Until [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in 1508, the Emperor-elect (''Imperator electus'') was required to be crowned by the Pope before assuming the imperial title. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was the last to be crowned by the Pope in 1530. Even after the [[Reformation]], the elected Emperor was always a [[Roman Catholic]].  There were short periods in history when the electoral college was dominated by [[Protestants]], and the electors usually voted in their own political interest.

{{further|Emperor|Translatio imperii|Problem of two emperors}}
From the time of [[Constantine I]] (r. 306&amp;ndash;337), the [[Roman emperor]]s had, with very few exceptions, taken on a role as promoters and defenders of [[State church of the Roman Empire|Christianity]].
The [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|reign of Constantine]] established a precedent for the position of the Christian emperor in the Church. Emperors considered themselves responsible to the gods for the spiritual health of their subjects, and after Constantine they had a duty to help the Church define orthodoxy and maintain orthodoxy. The emperor's role was to enforce doctrine, root out [[heresy]], and uphold ecclesiastical unity.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Jeffrey. ''The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476–752'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979) pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Both the title and connection between Emperor and [[Orthodox Christianity|Church]] continued in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] throughout the medieval period ([[Empire of Nicaea|in exile]] during 1204&amp;ndash;1261). The [[First seven ecumenical councils|ecumenical councils]] of the 5th to 8th centuries were convoked by the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Eastern Roman Emperors]].&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Jeffrey. ''The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages 476–752'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1979) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western Roman Empire|Western Europe]], the title of ''Emperor'' became defunct after the death of [[Julius Nepos]] in 480, although the rulers of the [[barbarian kingdoms]] continued to recognize the authority of the [[Eastern Emperor]] at least nominally well into the 6th century. In 797, the Eastern Emperor [[Constantine VI]] was deposed and replaced as monarch by his mother, [[Irene of Athens|Irene]]. The Papacy, which up until this point had continued to recognize the rulers in Constantinople as Roman Emperors, viewed the imperial throne as vacant since in their mind, a woman could not rule the empire.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce]], ''The Holy Roman Empire'', 1864, pp 62–64&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason, [[Charlemagne]], the King of the Franks and King of Italy, was crowned Emperor of the Romans (''Imperator Romanorum'') by [[Pope Leo III]], as the successor of Constantine VI as Roman Emperor under the concept of ''[[translatio imperii]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On his coins, the name and title used by Charlemagne is Karolus Imperator Augustus and in his own documents he used Imperator Augustus Romanum gubernans Imperium ("August Emperor, governing the Roman Empire") and serenissimus Augustus a Deo coronatus, magnus pacificus Imperator Romanorum gubernans Imperium ("most serene Augustus crowned by God, great peaceful emperor governing the empire of the Romans"). The Eastern Empire eventually relented to recognizing Charlemagne and his successors as emperors, but as "Frankish" and "German emperors", at no point referring to them as Roman, a label they reserved for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.7767/zrgka.1943.32.1.509|title = Eduard Eichmann, die Kaiserkrönung im Abendland. Ein Beitrag zur, Geistesgeschichte des Mittelalters, mit besonderer Berücksichtigung des kirchlichen Rechts, der Liturgie und der Kirchenpolitik|journal = Zeitschrift der Savigny-Stiftung für Rechtsgeschichte: Kanonistische Abteilung|volume = 32|pages = 509–525|year = 1943|last1 = Klewitz|first1 = Hans-Walter|url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12a7f9d0d83c0ccc245aaaec36be8ec63e5978b0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of Emperor in the West implied recognition by the pope. As the power of the papacy grew during the Middle Ages, popes and emperors came into conflict over church administration. The best-known and most bitter conflict was that known as the [[investiture controversy]], fought during the 11th century between [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&amp;nbsp;IV]] and [[Pope Gregory VII]].

After the coronation of Charlemagne, his successors maintained the title until the death of [[Berengar&amp;nbsp;I of Italy]] in 924. The comparatively brief interregnum between 924 and the coronation 
of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto the Great]] in 962 is taken as marking the transition from the [[Frankish Empire]] to the [[Holy Roman Empire]].
Under the [[Ottonians]], much of the former [[Carolingian]] kingdom of [[Eastern Francia]] fell within the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire.

Since 911, the various [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|German princes]] had elected the ''[[Kingdom of Germany|King of the Germans]]'' from among their peers. The King of the Germans would then be 
crowned as emperor following the precedent set by Charlemagne, during the period of 962&amp;ndash;1530. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was the last emperor to be crowned by the pope, and his successor, [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], merely adopted the title of "Emperor elect" in 1558. The final Holy Roman Emperor-elect, [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis&amp;nbsp;II]], abdicated in 1806 during the [[Napoleonic War]]s that saw the Empire's final dissolution.

The term ''sacrum'' (i.e., "holy") in connection with the German Roman Empire was first used in 1157 under [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick&amp;nbsp;I Barbarossa]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Moraw, ''Heiliges Reich'', in: [[Lexikon des Mittelalters]], Munich &amp; Zurich: Artemis 1977–1999, vol. 4, columns 2025–2028.&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard designation of the Holy Roman Emperor was "August Emperor of the Romans" (''Romanorum Imperator Augustus''). When Charlemagne was crowned in&amp;nbsp;800, he was styled as "most serene Augustus, crowned by God, great and pacific emperor, governing the Roman Empire," thus constituting the elements of "Holy" and "Roman" in the imperial title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Bryce  | first = James  | title = The Holy Roman Empire | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1968  | page = 530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''Roman'' was a reflection of the principle of ''[[translatio imperii]]'' (or in this case ''restauratio imperii'') that regarded the (Germanic) Holy Roman Emperors as the inheritors of the title of Emperor of the [[Western Roman Empire]], despite the continued existence of the Eastern Roman Empire.

In German-language historiography, the term ''Römisch-deutscher Kaiser'' ("Roman-German emperor") is used to distinguish the title from that of [[Roman Emperor]] on one hand, and that of [[German Emperor]] (''Deutscher Kaiser'') on the other. The English term "Holy Roman Emperor" is a modern shorthand for "emperor of the Holy Roman Empire" not corresponding to the historical style or title, i.e., the adjective "holy" is not intended as modifying "emperor"; the English term "Holy Roman Emperor" gained currency in the interbellum period (1920s to 1930s); formerly the title had also been rendered "German-Roman emperor" in English.&lt;ref name="German-Roman"&gt;''The New International Encyclopædia'' vol. 10 (1927), p. 675.

==Succession==
{{see|Italienzug|Family tree of the German monarchs}}
[[File:Balduineum Wahl Heinrich VII.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Illustration of the election of [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] (27 November 1308) showing (left to right) the Archbishop of Cologne, Archbishop of Mainz, Archbishop of Trier, Count Palatine of the Rhine, Duke of Saxony, Margrave of Brandenburg and King of Bohemia (''[[Codex Balduini Trevirorum]]'', c. 1340).]]
The [[elective monarchy]] of the [[kingdom of Germany]] goes back to the early 10th century, the election of [[Conrad I of Germany]] in 911 following the death without issue of [[Louis the Child]], the last [[Carolingian]] ruler of Germany. 
Elections meant the kingship of Germany was only partially hereditary, unlike the kingship of [[kingdom of France|France]], although sovereignty frequently remained in a dynasty until there were no more male successors. The process of an election meant that the prime candidate had to make concessions, by which the voters were kept on the side, which was known as ''Wahlkapitulationen'' ([[electoral capitulation]]).

Conrad was elected by the [[stem duchies|German dukes]], and it is not known precisely when the system of seven [[prince-electors]] was established. The papal decree ''Venerabilem'' by [[Innocent III]] (1202), addressed to [[Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen]], establishes the election procedure by (unnamed) princes of the realm, reserving for the pope the right to approve of the candidates.
A letter of [[Pope Urban IV]] (1263), in the context of the disputed vote of 1256 and the subsequent the [[Interregnum (HRE)|interregnum]], suggests that by "[[time immemorial|immemorial custom]]", seven princes had the right to elect the King and future Emperor.  The seven prince-electors are named in the [[Golden Bull of 1356]]: The [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Archbishop of Mainz]], the [[Electorate of Trier|Archbishop of Trier]], the [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]], the [[King of Bohemia]], the [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Count Palatine of the Rhine]], the [[Electorate of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]] and the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Margrave of Brandenburg]].

After 1438, the Kings remained in the house of [[Habsburg]] and [[Habsburg-Lorraine]], with the brief exception of [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VII]], who was a [[Wittelsbach]]. [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] (Emperor 1508–1519) and his successors no longer travelled to Rome to be crowned as Emperor by the Pope. Maximilian, therefore, named himself Elected Roman Emperor (''Erwählter Römischer Kaiser'') in 1508 with papal approval.  This title was in use by all his uncrowned successors. Of his successors, only [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the immediate one, received a papal coronation.

The Elector Palatine's seat was conferred on the [[Duke of Bavaria]] in 1621, but in 1648, in the wake of the [[Thirty Years' War]], the Elector Palatine was restored, as the eighth elector. [[Electorate of Hanover]] was added as a ninth elector in 1692. The whole college was reshuffled in the [[German mediatization]] of 1803 with a total of ten electors, a mere three years before the dissolution of the Empire.

==List of emperors==
{{See also|List of German monarchs}}
This list includes all 47 German monarchs crowned from Charlemagne until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire (800–1806).

Several rulers were crowned [[King of the Romans]] (King of Germany) but not emperor, although they styled themselves thus, among whom were: [[Conrad I of Germany]] and [[Henry the Fowler]] in the 10th century, and [[Conrad IV]], [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolf I]], [[Adolf of Germany|Adolf]] and [[Albert I of Germany|Albert I]] during the ''interregnum'' of the late 13th century.

Traditional historiography assumes a continuity between the [[Carolingian Empire]] and the Holy Roman Empire, while a modern convention takes the coronation of Otto I in 962 as the starting point of the Holy Roman Empire (although the term ''Sacrum Imperium Romanum'' was not in use before the 13th century).

===Holy Roman Emperors===
There was no emperor in the west between 924 and 962.

While earlier Germanic and Italian monarchs had been crowned as Roman emperors, the actual [[Holy Roman Empire]] is usually considered to have begun with the crowning of the Saxon king [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]]. It was officially an elective position, though at times it ran in families, notably the four generations of the [[Salian dynasty]] in the 11th century.  From the end of the Salian dynasty through the middle 15th century, the emperors drew from many different German dynasties, and it was rare for the throne to pass from father to son.  That changed with the ascension of the Austrian [[House of Habsburg]], as an unbroken line of Habsburgs held the imperial throne until the 18th century. Later a cadet branch known as the [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] passed it from father to son until the abolition of the Empire in 1806. Notably, the Habsburgs were also dispensed with the requirement that emperors be crowned by the pope before exercising their office. Starting with [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], all successive emperors forwent the traditional coronation.

The [[List of German monarchs#Interregnum|interregnum]] of the Holy Roman Empire is taken to have lasted from the deposition of Frederick II by [[Pope Innocent IV]] (1245, alternatively from the death of Frederick 1250 or the death of [[Conrad IV]] 1254) to the election of [[Rudolf I of Germany]] (1273).
Rudolf was not crowned emperor, nor were his successors [[Adolf of Germany|Adolf]] and [[Albert I of Germany|Albert]].  
The next emperor was [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]], crowned on 29 June 1312 by [[Pope Clement V]].

{{main|House of Habsburg}}
In 1508, [[Pope Julius II]] allowed Maximilian I to use the title of Emperor without coronation in Rome, though the title was qualified as Electus Romanorum Imperator ("elected Emperor of the Romans"). Maximilian's successors adopted the same titulature, usually when they became the sole ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. Maximilian's first successor Charles V was the last to be crowned Emperor.

==Coronation==
{{See also|Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|Papal appointment}}
The Emperor was crowned in a special ceremony, traditionally performed by the [[Pope]] in [[Rome]]. Without that coronation, no king, despite exercising all powers, could call himself Emperor. In 1508, Pope [[Julius II]] allowed [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] to use the title of Emperor without coronation in Rome, though the title was qualified as ''Electus Romanorum Imperator'' ("elected Emperor of the Romans"). Maximilian's successors adopted the same titulature, usually when they became the sole ruler of the Holy Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;" Wir Franz der Zweyte, von Gottes Gnaden erwählter römischer Kaiser {{Citation|last=Imperator Austriae|first=Fransiscus I|title=Allerhöchste Pragmatikal-Verordnung vom 11.
