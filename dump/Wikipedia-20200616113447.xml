==History==
[[Joseph Young]] arrived in South Florida in 1920 to create his own “Dream City in Florida.” His vision included the beaches of the Atlantic Ocean stretching westward with man made lakes, infrastructure, roads and the Intracoastal waterway. He wanted to include large parks, schools, churches, and golf courses; these were all industries and activities which were very important to Young's life.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} After Young spent millions of dollars on the construction of the city, he was elected as the first mayor in 1925. This new town quickly became home to northerners known as snowbirds. These snowbirds flee the north during the winter and then escape the south during the summer to avoid the harsh climates.  By 1960, Hollywood contained more than 2,400 hotel units along with the construction of 12,170 single family homes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodfl.org/index.aspx?NID=187|title=Hollywood, FL - Official Website - History of Hollywood|website=hollywoodfl.org|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young bought up thousands of acres of land around 1920, and named his new town "Hollywood by the Sea" to distinguish it from his other real estate venture, "Hollywood in the Hills", in New York.
[[File:Hollywd.jpg|thumb|Hollywood beach in August 2014]]

The [[American Guide Series|Florida guide]], published by the [[Federal Writers' Project]], describes the early development of Hollywood, an early example of a [[planned community]] that proliferated in Florida during the real estate boom of the 1920s:
{{Quote
|text=During the early days of development here, 1,500 trucks and tractors were engaged in clearing land and grading streets; two yacht basins, designed by General [[George Washington Goethals]], chief engineer in the construction of the [[Panama Canal]], were dredged and connected with the Intracostal Waterway. A Large power plant was installed, and when the city lights went on for the first time, ships at sea reported that Miami was on fire, and their radio alarms and the red glow in the sky brought people to the rescue from miles around.

|author=Federal Writers'Project|title="Part III: The Florida Loop"  |source=''Florida: A Guide to the Southernmost State'' (1947)
}}

Prospective purchasers of land were enticed by free hotel accommodation and entertainment, and "were driven about the city-to-be on trails blazed through palmetto thickets; so desolate and forlorn were some stretches that many women became hysterical, it is said, and a few fainted.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Young had a vision of having lakes, golf courses, a luxury beach hotel (Hollywood Beach Hotel, now Hollywood Beach Resort), country clubs, and a main street, Hollywood Boulevard.&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zVMhsLpl8JUC|title=Race &amp; Change in Hollywood, Florida|last=Oliver|first=Kitty|date=2012-09-18|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9781439627655|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[1926 Miami hurricane]], Hollywood was severely damaged; local newspapers reported that Hollywood was second only to Miami in losses from the storm.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Following Young's death in 1934, the city encountered other destructive hurricanes and the stock market crashed with personal financial misfortunes.&lt;ref name="Oliver"/&gt;

Following the damage inflicted by Hurricane Irma in 2017, an initiative called Rebuild Florida was created by the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (DEO) to provide aid to citizens affected by the natural disaster. The initial focus of Rebuild Florida was its Housing Repair Program, which offered assistance in rebuilding families' homes that were impacted by Hurricane Irma. The program priorities low-income vulnerable residents, such as the disabled, the elderly and those families with children under five.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}
