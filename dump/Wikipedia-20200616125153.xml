==Cast and characters==
{{Main|List of Madam Secretary characters}}

===Main===
* [[Téa Leoni]] as [[Elizabeth McCord (character)|Elizabeth "Bess" Adams McCord]], the [[President of the United States]] and former [[United States Secretary of State]]. She spent twenty years as a CIA analyst before becoming a professor of political science at the [[University of Virginia]]. She was appointed by her old boss, Conrad Dalton, who was then the President of the United States, to replace Secretary of State Vincent Marsh, who died in a plane crash. She succeeded Dalton as President.
* [[Tim Daly]] as Henry McCord, Elizabeth's husband of 25 years and now First Gentleman of the United States. A theology professor and a former Marine captain/aviator during [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]], his unique blend of skills are sought by the National Security Agency, which engages him as an operative in combating religious extremism. At the end of season{{nbsp}}3, Henry is named the head of the CIA [[Special Activities Division]].
* [[Bebe Neuwirth]] as Nadine Tolliver (seasons 1–4), Elizabeth's [[chief of staff]] who had a six-year affair with the deceased Secretary of State, Vincent Marsh, beginning when he was a senator. Originally suspicious and resentful of the new Secretary of State, Nadine soon learns to trust Elizabeth, and the two cultivate a strong working relationship. In season{{nbsp}}1, Nadine slowly begins to date again, romancing [[List of Administrators and Deputy Administrators of NASA|NASA Administrator]] Glenn, and later falls into a relationship with the recurring political consultant Mike Barnow. In season{{nbsp}}4, Nadine's son Roman tells her she is going to be a grandmother and she retires from the State Department and moves to San Francisco to spend more time with her family.
* [[Željko Ivanek]] as Russell Jackson, [[White House Chief of Staff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Andreeva |first1=Nellie |title=Željko Ivanek Upped to Regular on New CBS Drama Series ''Madam Secretary'' |url=https://deadline.com/2014/05/zeljko-ivanek-upped-to-regular-on-new-cbs-drama-series-madam-secretary-734350/ |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=August 26, 2014 |date=May 21, 2014 |quote=Emmy-winning character actor Željko Ivanek (''Damages'') joined the cast of CBS' new drama series Madam Secretary as a regular after guest-starring in the pilot.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His primary objective of keeping the President politically secure at home and abroad sets him up for occasional confrontations with Secretary McCord's unorthodox diplomatic maneuvering. Elizabeth then appoints him as her White House Chief of Staff 98 days into her presidency.
* [[Erich Bergen]] as Blake Moran, Elizabeth's [[personal assistant]], and the only member of her staff that she hired rather than inherited. After college, he began a career in finance on Wall Street, but hated it. In season{{nbsp}}5, Elizabeth made good on her promise to fire him, only to rehire him as her new assistant policy advisor.
* [[Patina Miller]] as Daisy Grant, Elizabeth's [[Press secretary|press coordinator]]. Daisy briefly dates Matt in season{{nbsp}}1, but goes on to date other men following their breakup. In season{{nbsp}}3, she dates "Kevin" from Budget and Planning, who turns out to be an undercover operative for the CIA investigating the State Department. He is killed in a weapons-trafficking conspiracy, and Daisy subsequently finds herself pregnant with his child. In the fourth season, Daisy gives birth to her daughter Joanna Grant. 
* [[Geoffrey Arend]] as Matt Mahoney (seasons 1–6), Elizabeth's [[speechwriter]]. Matt briefly dates Daisy in season{{nbsp}}1.
* [[Wallis Currie-Wood]] as Stephanie "Stevie" McCord, Elizabeth and Henry's older daughter. Stevie attended Lovell University and later Georgetown University and applied to Harvard Law school. Stevie serves as an intern to Russell Jackson and was, for a time, engaged to Jareth Glover. She has an affair with Dmitri Petrov (then undercover) in season{{nbsp}}4 that puts her in peril.
* Kathrine Herzer as Alison McCord (seasons 1–6), Elizabeth and Henry's younger daughter.
* [[Evan Roe]] as Jason McCord (seasons 1–6), Elizabeth and Henry's teenage son, a self-proclaimed anarchist. Jason is critical of political systems in general, but in season{{nbsp}}1 he is expelled from his school for punching a student who insulted Elizabeth. He eventually dates Piper Boroumand.
* [[Keith Carradine]] as Conrad Dalton (seasons 2–6; recurring season 1), the President of the United States. Conrad served in the [[United States Marine Corps]] as a [[second lieutenant]] during the [[Vietnam War]] and was the [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency]] during Elizabeth's time at the CIA. In the third season, Dalton secures reelection as an [[Independent politician|independent]] after failing to secure the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s nomination, partly due to a controversial change in policy championed by Elizabeth. He offers Elizabeth the role of Vice President during his campaign, but eventually names Teresa Hurst in order to further his campaign. Elizabeth remains the Secretary of State.
* [[Sebastian Arcelus]] as Jay Whitman (seasons 3–6; recurring seasons 1–2), Elizabeth's current chief of staff and previous senior [[Public policy|policy advisor]]. In season{{nbsp}}3, it is revealed that Jay's busy schedule working for the Secretary has strained his marriage. He is currently separated from his wife Abby, who maintains custody of their daughter Chloe. Jay is promoted to chief of staff in season{{nbsp}}4 after Nadine Tolliver leaves. In season 5, while stuck at an airport with Elizabeth and her staff, Jay meets Annelies De Runnow ([[Marissa Neitling]]), a world-famous chess player, and they develop an attraction to each other. After several hours stuck in the airport, Jay and Annelies agree to start a long-distance relationship. Although Elizabeth eventually decides to run for president (a campaign she eventually wins), Jay decides to leave her campaign and pass on the chance to become her chief of staff to start a life with Annelies.
* [[Sara Ramirez]] as Kat Sandoval (seasons 4–5), Elizabeth's policy advisor and a former chief of staff to the UN Ambassador.
* [[Kevin Rahm]] as Michael "Mike B." Barnow (season 6; recurring seasons 1–5), a political operator who is said to drift between the [[Cabinet of the United States|United States Cabinet]] departments. It is mentioned that he is a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]], who turned his brilliant legal career into a promising political career that was cut short by a scandalous divorce six years prior to his first appearance before settling into his current job. His unofficial role as an adviser to Secretary McCord earned him a reputation as her 'hatchet man'. Elizabeth later appoints him as the campaign manager of her successful presidential campaign and, after her victory in the 2020 election, he serves as her [[White House Chief of Staff]] for her first 100 days. Although Elizabeth asks him to remain as chief of staff, he refuses but remains at the White House as a [[Counselor to the President]]. Mike was rarely seen without his dog Gordon before its death in latter half of Season 5.

* '''Note:''' In seasons four through six during the fall, the series was scheduled to air at 10:30{{nbsp}}p.m. ET/9:30{{nbsp}}p.m. CT to allow for [[National Football League|football]] and [[PGA Tour|golf]] overruns (there were no delays from Mountain Time westward). Since its move to the last hour of primetime, this resulted in several new episodes being delayed a week at the last minute due to a game's overrunning, to all CBS affiliate [[local news]]casts to start as close to 11:00{{nbsp}}p.m. ET/ 10:00{{nbsp}}p.m. CT as possible; in this case, a repeat aired in the Mountain Time Zone westward instead, with Canadian broadcaster [[Global Television Network|Global]] following CBS's scheduling in order to take advantage of [[simultaneous substitution|simsub]] advertising opportunities.

===Critical reception===
''Madam Secretary'' has been met with generally positive reviews from TV critics. On [[Metacritic]], the show has a score of 66 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/madam-secretary|title=''Madam Secretary'' : Season 1|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the show holds a rating of 67% based on reviews from 52 critics. The site's consensus for the first season reads, "Bolstered by [[Tea Leoni]]'s strong central performance, ''Madam Secretary'' is a solid but unspectacular political drama."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/madam-secretary/s01/|title=''Madam Secretary'': Season 1 (2014)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Three women have served as Secretary of State to date: [[Madeleine Albright]] from 1997 to 2001 under [[Bill Clinton]], [[Condoleezza Rice]] from 2005 to 2009 under [[George W. Bush]], and [[Hillary Clinton]] from 2009 to 2013 under [[Barack Obama]]. Shortly after the series' debut, [[Fox News]] asked if the show served as a campaign ad supporting Hillary Clinton, but quoted the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' saying the lead character was "no Hillary knock-off" and a New York publicist calling the casting of a woman "simple business and smart on CBS' behalf."&lt;ref name="Fox News 2014-09"/&gt; Conservative activist organization [[Culture and Media Institute]] said "The connections in the show between Elizabeth and Hillary are clear, from the blond hair to the pantsuits."&lt;ref name="Fox News 2014-09"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/09/22/madam-secretary-campaign-ad-for-hillary-clinton-2016/|title=''Madam Secretary'' a campaign ad for Hillary Clinton 2016?|last=McKay|first=Hollie|website=[[Fox News]]|date=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the trailer of the fifteenth episode of the third season titled "Break in Diplomacy" was released showing McCord responding to unwanted sexual advances by fictional [[President of the Philippines|Philippine president]] Datu Andrada by punching Andrada in the face, it became controversial in the Philippines. Viewers thought there were parallels between Andrada and real-life Philippine President [[Rodrigo Duterte]], who was known for making inappropriate and sexist remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2017/03/07/sexist-filipino-president-madam-secretary/|title=People are furious that ''Madam Secretary'' will feature a lecherous Filipino president|date=March 7, 2017|website=Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Embassy of the Philippines, Washington, D.C.|Philippine Embassy]] in Washington published a statement protesting the negative depiction of the presidential character on its Facebook page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/philippinesusa/posts/1756907977656512|title=Embassy of the Philippines, Washington Facebook page|date=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth-season premiere, "News Cycle", led to a protest from [[East Timor]]'s Minister of State [[José Ramos-Horta]], a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate. He said, "It is a slander against a country that only shows ignorance and racism."&lt;ref name="Diáro"/&gt; The TV show used the border dispute between [[Australia]] and East Timor in the [[Timor Sea]] as background story. (The dispute is transferred in the TV show to the [[South China Sea]], although neither Australia nor East Timor borders it.) East Timor is shown as a country controlled by a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[drug cartel]] and used for drug transfer. US Secretary of State McCord is asking [[China]] to take measures to prevent the leader of the drug cartel from making a [[narco-state]] out of East Timor.&lt;ref name="Diáro"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dn.pt/lusa/interior/ramos-horta-vai-protestar-por-retrato-de-timor-leste-em-serie-norte-americana-8829136.html|title=Ramos-Horta vai protestar por retrato de Timor-Leste em série norte-americana|website=Diário de Notícias|date=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
