'''Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|iː|m|ən}}) was a global [[financial services]] firm founded in 1847.&lt;ref name="Bernhard5" /&gt; Before [[Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers|filing for bankruptcy]] in 2008, Lehman was the fourth-largest [[investment bank]] in the United States (behind [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Morgan Stanley]], and [[Merrill Lynch]]), doing business in investment banking, [[Stock|equity]] and [[Bond (finance)|fixed-income]] sales and [[stock trading|trading]] (especially U.S. [[Treasury securities]]), research, [[investment management]], [[private equity]], and [[private banking]]. Lehman was operational for 158 years from its founding in 1850 until 2008.&lt;ref name="Dubofsky2013"&gt;{{cite book |author=Melvyn Dubofsky |title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of American Busgle.com/books?id=D-NMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA470 |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-973881-6 |pages=470–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 15, 2008, the firm filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]] following the exodus of most of its clients, drastic losses in its stock, and devaluation of assets by [[credit rating agencies]], largely sparked by a loss of confidence, Lehman's involvement in the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], and its exposure to less liquid assets.&lt;ref name="Malloy2010"&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael P.

After Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, global markets immediately plummeted.

== History ==

=== Under the Lehman family (1850–1969) ===
{{See also|Lehman family}}
[[File:Lehman Brothers.jpg|thumb|right| Emanuel and Mayer Lehman]]
In 1844, 23-year-old [[Henry Lehman]],&lt;ref name=Geisst49&gt;Geisst, Charles R. ''The Last Partnerships''. McGraw-Hill, 1997, page 49&lt;/ref&gt; the son of a Jewish cattle merchant, emigrated to the United States from [[Rimpar]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]].&lt;ref name=Bernhard1&gt;Bernhard, William, L., Birge, June Rossbach Bingham, Loeb, John L., Jr..  '' Lots of Lehmans – The Family of Mayer Lehman of Lehman Brothers, Remembered by His Descendants''. [[Center For Jewish History]], 2007, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; He settled in [[Montgomery, Alabama]],&lt;ref name="Geisst49" /&gt; where he opened a [[Dry goods|dry-goods]] store, "H. Lehman".&lt;ref name=Wechsberg233&gt;Wechsberg, Joseph.  ''The Merchant Bankers''. Pocket Books, 1966, page 233&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1847, following the arrival of his brother [[Emanuel Lehman]], the firm became "H. Lehman and Bro."&lt;ref name=Bernhard5&gt;Bernhard, William, L., Birge, June Rossbach Bingham, Loeb, John L., Jr..  '' Lots of Lehmans – The Family of Mayer Lehman of Lehman Brothers, Remembered by His Descendants''. Center For Jewish History, 2007, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;  With the arrival of their youngest brother, [[Mayer Lehman]], in 1850, the firm changed its name again and "Lehman Brothers" was founded.&lt;ref name="Wechsberg233" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Birmingham47&gt;Birmingham, Stephen.  ''[[Our Crowd: The Great Jewish Families of New York]]''. Harper and Row, 1967, page 47&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1850s, cotton was one of the most important crops in the United States, and was Alabama's highest-grossing cash crop. Until the U.S. Civil War, nearly all U.S. cotton was produced by slave labor, and by the 1860 census, slaves constituted nearly 45% of Alabama's total population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2019/06/11/the-lehman-trilogy-and-wall-streets-debt-to-slavery/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Capitalizing on cotton's high market value, the three brothers began to routinely accept raw cotton from customers [[bartering|as payment for merchandise]], eventually beginning a second business trading in cotton. Within a few years this business grew to become the most significant part of their operation. Following Henry's death from [[yellow fever]] in 1855,&lt;ref name="Wechsberg233" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Geisst50&gt;Geisst, Charles R. ''The Last Partnerships''. [[McGraw-Hill]], 1997, page 50&lt;/ref&gt; the remaining brothers continued to focus on their commodities-trading/brokerage operations.

By 1858, the center of cotton trading had shifted from the South to [[New York City]], where [[Factor (agent)|factors]] and commission houses were based. Lehman opened its first branch office at 119 [[Liberty Street (Manhattan)|Liberty Street]],&lt;ref name="Geisst50" /&gt; and 32-year-old Emanuel relocated there to run the office.&lt;ref name="Wechsberg233" /&gt;  In 1862, facing difficulties as a result of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the firm teamed up with a cotton merchant named John Durr to form Lehman, Durr &amp; Co.&lt;ref name=Birmingham77&gt;Birmingham, Stephen.  ''[[Our Crowd: The Great Jewish Families of New York]]''. Harper and Row, 1967, page 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernhard8&gt;Bernhard, William, L., Birge, June Rossbach Bingham, Loeb, John L., Jr..  '' Lots of Lehmans – The Family of Mayer Lehman of Lehman Brothers, Remembered by His Descendants''. Center For Jewish History, 2007, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the war the company helped finance [[History of Alabama#Reconstruction, 1865-1875|Alabama's reconstruction]]. The firm's headquarters were eventually moved to New York City, where it helped found the [[New York Cotton Exchange]] in 1870;&lt;ref name="Geisst50" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wechsberg235&gt;Wechsberg, Joseph.  ''The Merchant Bankers''. Pocket Books, 1966, page 235&lt;/ref&gt;  Emanuel sat on the board of governors until 1884. The firm also dealt in the emerging market for railroad bonds and entered the financial-advisory business.

Lehman became a member of the [[Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange|Coffee Exchange]] as early as 1883 and finally the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in 1887.&lt;ref name="Geisst50" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wechsberg235" /&gt;  In 1899, it [[underwriting|underwrote]] its first public offering, the preferred and common stock of the [[International Steam Pump Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Swaine |first=Robert T. |date=1946 |title=The Cravath Firm and Its Predecessors, 1819-1947 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p8jmmSwD9KEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA196 |location= |publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd. |page=633 |isbn=978-1-58477-713-7 |accessdate=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the offering of International Steam, the firm's real shift from being a commodities house to a house of issue did not begin until 1906. In that year, under Emanuel's son [[Philip Lehman]], the firm partnered with [[Goldman Sachs|Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.]],&lt;ref name=Geisst51&gt;Geisst, Charles R. ''The Last Partnerships''. McGraw-Hill, 1997, page 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Geisst285&gt;Geisst, Charles R. ''The Last Partnerships''. McGraw-Hill, 1997, page 285&lt;/ref&gt;  to bring the General Cigar Co. to market,&lt;ref name=Wechsberg238&gt;Wechsberg, Joseph.  ''The Merchant Bankers''. Pocket Books, 1966, page 238&lt;/ref&gt;  followed closely by [[Sears, Roebuck and Company]].&lt;ref name="Wechsberg238" /&gt; During the following two decades, almost one hundred new issues were underwritten by Lehman, many times in conjunction with Goldman, Sachs. Among these were [[F.W. Woolworth Company]],&lt;ref name="Wechsberg238" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Geisst53&gt;Geisst, Charles R. ''The Last Partnerships''. McGraw-Hill, 1997, page 53&lt;/ref&gt; [[May Department Stores Company]], [[Gimbel's|Gimbel Brothers, Inc.]],&lt;ref name=Wechsberg241&gt;Wechsberg, Joseph.  ''The Merchant Bankers''. Pocket Books, 1966, page 241&lt;/ref&gt; [[Macy's|R.H. Macy &amp; Company]],&lt;ref name="Wechsberg241" /&gt; [[Studebaker|The Studebaker Corporation]],&lt;ref name="Geisst53" /&gt;  the [[Goodrich Corporation|B.F. Goodrich Co.]] and [[Endicott Johnson Corporation]].

Following Philip Lehman's retirement in 1925, his son [[Robert Lehman|Robert "Bobbie" Lehman]] took over as head of the firm. During Bobbie's tenure, the company weathered the capital crisis of the [[Great Depression]] by focusing on [[venture capital]] while the [[equities]] market recovered.

Traditionally a family-only partnership, in 1924, John M. Hancock became the first non-family member to join the firm,&lt;ref name="Geisst51" /&gt;&lt;ref name=UND1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.und.nodak.edu/dept/library/Collections/og55.html |publisher=University of North Dakota |title=John M. Hancock Papers |accessdate=September 14, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210020012/http://www.und.nodak.edu/dept/library/Collections/og55.html |archivedate=February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Monroe C. Gutman and Paul Mazur in 1927. By 1928, the firm had moved to its [[One William Street]] location.

[[Image:PeterGeorgePeterson.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Peter G. Peterson|Pete Peterson]]]]
In the 1930s, Lehman underwrote the [[initial public offering]] of the first [[list of television manufacturers|television manufacturer]], [[DuMont Laboratories]], and helped fund the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA).&lt;ref name="ingrham"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ingham |first=John N. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J9nXHgKQ49EC&amp;pg=PA786&amp;lpg=PA786&amp;dq=lehman+brothers+rca |title=Biographical Dictionary of American Business Leaders |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |year=1983 |accessdate=September 14, 2008 |isbn=9780313213625}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also helped finance the rapidly growing oil industry, including the companies [[Halliburton]] and [[Kerr-McGee]]. In the 1950s, Lehman underwrote the IPO of [[Digital Equipment Corporation]].  Later, it arranged the acquisition of Digital by [[Compaq]].

=== An evolving partnership (1969–1984) ===
{{More citations needed section|date=March 2016}}[[Robert Lehman]] died in 1969 after 44 years as the patriarch of the firm, leaving no member of the Lehman family actively involved with the partnership.&lt;ref name=Geisst77&gt;Geisst, Charles R. ''The Last Partnerships''. McGraw-Hill, 1997, page 77 {{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert's death, coupled with a lack of a clear successor from within the Lehman family, left a void in the company. At the same time, Lehman was facing strong headwinds amidst the difficult economic environment of the early 1970s. By 1972, the firm was facing hard times and in 1973, [[Peter G. Peterson|Pete Peterson]], chairman and chief executive officer of the [[Bell &amp; Howell]] Corporation, was brought in to save the firm.&lt;ref name="Geisst77" /&gt;

Under Peterson's leadership as chairman and CEO, the firm acquired Abraham &amp; Co. in 1975, and two years later merged with the venerable, but struggling, [[Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.]],&lt;ref name=Geisst77/&gt; to form [[Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc.]], the country's fourth-largest investment bank, behind [[Salomon Brothers]], [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[First Boston]].&lt;ref name="sloane"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F60814F93F5B117B93CBAB178AD95F438785F9 |title=Lehman and Kuhn Loeb to Merge; Lehman Brothers and Kuhn Loeb Sign Agreement to Merge December 16 |first=Leonard |last=Sloane |date=November 29, 1977 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peterson led the firm from significant operating losses to five consecutive years of record profits with a [[return on equity]] among the highest in the investment-banking industry.

By the early 1980s, hostilities between the firm's [[investment banker]]s and [[trader (finance)|traders]] (who were driving most of the firm's profits) prompted Peterson to promote [[Lewis Glucksman]], the firm's President, COO and former trader, to be his co-CEO in May 1983. Glucksman introduced a number of changes that had the effect of increasing tensions, which when coupled with Glucksman’s management style and a downturn in the markets, resulted in a power struggle that ousted Peterson and left Glucksman as the sole CEO.&lt;ref name=Geisst78&gt;Geisst, Charles R. ''The Last Partnerships''. McGraw-Hill, 1997, page 78&lt;/ref&gt;

Upset bankers, who had soured over the power struggle, left the company. [[Stephen A. Schwarzman]], chairman of the firm's [[mergers and acquisitions|M&amp;A]] committee, recalled in a February 2003 interview with ''[[Private Equity International]]'' that "Lehman Brothers had an extremely competitive internal environment, which ultimately became dysfunctional."  The company suffered under the disintegration, and Glucksman was pressured into selling the firm.

=== Merger with American Express (1984–1994) ===
[[Image:Shearson Lehman Logo.png|thumb|right|[[Shearson Lehman/American Express]] Logo]]
{{Main|Shearson Lehman Hutton}}
[[Shearson/American Express]], an [[American Express]]-owned securities company focused on brokerage rather than investment banking, acquired Lehman in 1984, for $360&amp;nbsp;million. On May 11, the combined firms became Shearson Lehman/American Express.&lt;ref name="Geisst78" /&gt;  In 1988, [[Shearson Lehman/American Express]] and [[E.F. Hutton &amp; Co.]] merged as [[Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.]]&lt;ref name="cole"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DC1239F937A35751C1A961948260&amp;scp=77&amp;sq=shearson+lehman+hutton&amp;st=nyt |title=Company News – Hutton-Shearson Deal Announced |work=The New York Times |date=December 4, 1987 |first=Robert J. |last=Cole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1983 to 1990, [[Peter A. Cohen]] was CEO and chairman of Shearson Lehman Brothers,&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://people.forbes.com/profile/peter-a-cohen/48145 |title=Profile: Peter A.

Hutton]] to form [[Shearson Lehman Hutton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pro.corbis.com/search/Enlargement.aspx?CID=isg&amp;mediauid=%7B56850BCA-B9AB-46D6-931A-D184A7C0A95A%7D |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120720030028/http://pro.corbis.com/search/Enlargement.aspx?CID=isg&amp;mediauid=%7B56850BCA-B9AB-46D6-931A-D184A7C0A95A%7D |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 20, 2012 |title=Shearson Lehman Buying out E.F. Hutton – Rights Managed |publisher=Pro.corbis.com |accessdate=October 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period, Shearson Lehman was aggressive in building its [[leveraged finance]] business in the model of rival [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]]. In 1989, Shearson backed [[F. Ross Johnson]]'s management team in its attempted [[management buyout]] of [[RJR Nabisco]] but were ultimately outbid by private equity firm [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]], who was backed by Drexel.

=== Divestment and independence (1994–2008) ===
In 1993, under newly appointed CEO [[Harvey Golub]], [[American Express]] began to divest itself of its banking and brokerage operations. It sold its retail brokerage and asset management operations to [[Primerica Financial Services|Primerica]]&lt;ref name="quint"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE0D8143AF930A25750C0A965958260&amp;scp=14&amp;sq=american+express+shearson&amp;st=nyt |title=Primerica Will Buy Shearson for $1&amp;nbsp;billion |work=The New York Times |date=March 13, 1993 |first=Michael |last=Quint}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1994 it spun off Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb in an [[initial public offering]], as Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc.&lt;ref name=Geisst79&gt;Geisst, Charles R. ''The Last Partnerships''. McGraw-Hill, 1997, page 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite rumors that it would be acquired again, Lehman performed quite well under chairman and CEO [[Richard S. Fuld, Jr.]]. By 2008, Fuld had been with the company for 30 years, and would be the longest-tenured CEO on [[Wall Street]]. Fuld had steered Lehman through the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]], a period where the firm's share price dropped to $22 [[USD]] in 1998, but he was said to have underestimated the downturn in the US housing market and its effect on Lehman's mortgage bond underwriting business. Fuld kept his job as the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] took hold, while CEOs of rivals like [[Bear Stearns]], [[Merrill Lynch]], and [[Citigroup]] were forced to resign.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1341059120080914 |agency=Reuters |title=Lehman CEO Fuld's hubris contributed to meltdown |date=September 14, 2008 |author=Christian Plumb and Dan Wilchins |accessdate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Lehman's board of directors, which included retired CEOs like [[Vodafone]]'s Christopher Gent and [[IBM]]'s [[John Akers]] were reluctant to challenge Fuld as the firm's share price spiraled lower.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt;

Fuld had a succession of "number twos" under him, usually titled as president and chief operating officer. Chris Pettit was Fuld's second-in-command for two decades until November 26, 1996, when he resigned as president and board member. Pettit lost a power struggle with his deputies (Steve Lessing, Tom Tucker, and Joseph M. Gregory) in March 1996 that caused him to relinquish its COO title, likely brought about after the three men found out about Pettit's extramarital affairs, which violated Fuld's unwritten rules on marriage and social etiquette. Bradley Jack and Joseph M. Gregory were appointed co-COOs in 2002, but Jack was demoted to the office of the chairman in May 2004 and departed in June 2005 with a severance package of $80&amp;nbsp;million, making Gregory the sole COO. While Fuld was considered the "face" of Lehman brothers, Gregory was in charge of day-to-day operations and he influenced culture to drive the bottom line.&lt;ref name="nymag.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nymag.com/print/?/news/business/52603/ |title=Print Page |publisher=Nymag.com |accessdate=October 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory was demoted on June 12, 2008 and replaced as president and COO by [[Bart McDade]], who had been serving as head of Equities, and McDade would see Lehman through bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ward |first=Vicky |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2010/04/lehman-wives-201004 |title=Business: Lehman's Desperate Housewives &amp;#124 |publisher=VanityFair.com |date=October 20, 2009 |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="truell"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/27/business/pettit-resigns-as-president-of-lehman-brothers-firm.html |work=The New York Times |first=Peter |last=Truell |title=Pettit Resigns as President Of Lehman Brothers Firm |date=November 27, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDade would later be one of a handful of Lehman executives offered a position with [[Barclays]] after [[Lehman Brothers#Barclays acquisition|their acquisition]]; he would step down after less than two months.&lt;ref name=nytimes-1108&gt;{{cite news |url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/mcdade-to-leave-barclays-capital/ |title=McDade to Leave Barclays Capital |work=The New York Times |date=October 31, 2008 |first1=Ben |last1=White |first2=Michael J. |last2=de la Merced}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to going bankrupt, the firm had in excess of $275&amp;nbsp;billion in assets under management. Altogether, since going public in 1994, the firm had increased net revenues over 600% from $2.73&amp;nbsp;billion to $19.2&amp;nbsp;billion and had increased employee headcount over 230% from 8,500 to almost 28,600.

* Deal of the Year – Equity Market Deal of the Year

=== Response to September 11, 2001 attacks ===
[[Image:Lehman Brothers Times Square by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|The former New York City headquarters now owned by [[Barclays]].]]
On [[September 11, 2001]], Lehman occupied three floors of [[List of tenants in One World Trade Center|World Trade Center]] where one of its employees was killed in the [[terrorist]] attacks of that day. Its global headquarters in [[Three World Financial Center]] were severely damaged and rendered unusable by falling debris, displacing over 6,500 employees. The bank recovered quickly and rebuilt its presence. Trading operations moved across the Hudson River to its [[Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]], facilities, where an impromptu trading floor was built in a hotel and brought online less than forty-eight hours after the attacks. When stock markets reopened on September 17, 2001, Lehman's sales and trading capabilities were restored.

In the ensuing months, the firm fanned out its operations across the New York City metropolitan area in over 40 temporary locations. The investment-banking division converted the first-floor lounges, restaurants, and all 665 guestrooms of the [[Sheraton New York, Times Square|Sheraton Manhattan Hotel]] into office space.&lt;ref name="egbert"&gt;{{cite news |title=Lehman Checks into Sheraton |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2001-09-19/news/18366151_1_lehman-brothers-investment-bank-sheraton-new-york |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |date=September 19, 2001 |author=Bill Egbert |publisher=nydailynews.com |accessdate=February 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514020349/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2001-09-19/news/18366151_1_lehman-brothers-investment-bank-sheraton-new-york |archivedate=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bank also experimented with [[flextime]] (to share office space) and [[telecommuting]] via [[virtual private networking]]. In October 2001, Lehman purchased a 32-story, {{convert|1050000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} office building for a reported sum of $700&amp;nbsp;million. The building, located at 745 Seventh Avenue, had recently been completed, and not yet occupied, by rival [[Morgan Stanley]].

With Morgan Stanley's world headquarters located only two blocks away at [[Morgan Stanley Building|1585 Broadway]], in the wake of the attacks the firm was re-evaluating its office plans which would have put over 10,000 employees in the [[Times Square]] area of New York City. Lehman began moving into the new facility in January and finished in March 2002, a move that significantly boosted morale throughout the firm.&lt;ref name="nymag.com" /&gt;

The firm was criticized for not moving back to its former headquarters in lower Manhattan. Following the attacks, only [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Goldman Sachs]], and [[Merrill Lynch]], of the major firms, remained in the downtown area. Lehman, however, pointed to the facts that it was committed to stay in New York City, that the new headquarters represented an ideal circumstance where the firm was desperate to buy and Morgan Stanley was desperate to sell, that when the new building was purchased, the structural integrity of [[Three World Financial Center]] had not yet been given a clean bill of health, and that the company could not have waited until May 2002 for repairs to Three World Financial Center to conclude.

After the attacks, Lehman's management placed increased emphasis on [[business continuity planning]]. Unlike its rivals, the company was unusually concentrated for a [[bulge bracket|bulge-bracket]] investment bank. For example, Morgan Stanley maintains a {{convert|750000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} trading-and-banking facility in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], New York. The trading floor of [[UBS AG|UBS]] is located in [[Stamford, Connecticut]]. Merrill Lynch's asset-management division is located in [[Plainsboro Township, New Jersey]]. Aside from its headquarters in Three World Financial Center, Lehman maintained operations-and-backoffice facilities in [[Jersey City]], space that the firm considered leaving prior to 9/11. The space was not only retained, but expanded, including the construction of a backup-trading facility. In addition, telecommuting technology first rolled out in the days following the attacks to allow employees to work from home was expanded and enhanced for general use throughout the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citrix.com/site/resources/dynamic/customerStory/lehman_bros_12_03_cs_us.pdf |title=Cast Study: Lehman Brothers |year=2003 |publisher=Citrix.com |accessdate=February 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124071351/http://www.citrix.com/site/resources/dynamic/customerStory/lehman_bros_12_03_cs_us.pdf |archivedate=November 24, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== June 2003 SEC litigation ===
In June 2003, the company was one of ten firms which simultaneously entered into a settlement with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), the [[New York State Attorney General|Office of the New York State Attorney General]] and various other securities regulators, regarding undue influence over each firm's research analysts by its investment-banking divisions. Specifically, regulators alleged that the firms had improperly associated analyst compensation with the firms' investment-banking revenues, and promised favorable, market-moving research coverage, in exchange for underwriting opportunities. The settlement, known as the "[[global settlement]]", provided for total financial penalties of $1.4&amp;nbsp;billion, including $80&amp;nbsp;million against Lehman, and structural reforms, including a complete separation of investment banking departments from research departments, no analyst compensation, directly or indirectly, from investment-banking revenues, and the provision of free, independent, third-party, research to the firms' clients.

== Rise of mortgage origination (1997–2006) ==
Lehman was one of the first Wall Street firms to move into the business of [[mortgage origination]]. In 1997, Lehman bought Colorado-based lender, Aurora Loan Services, an [[Alt-A]] lender. In 2000, to expand their mortgage origination pipeline, Lehman purchased West Coast subprime mortgage lender BNC Mortgage LLC. Lehman quickly became a force in the subprime market. By 2003 Lehman made $18.2 billion in loans and ranked third in lending.  By 2004, this number topped $40 billion. By 2006, Aurora and BNC were lending almost $50 billion per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Uncontrolled Risk |last=Williams |first=Mark |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |date=April 12, 2010 |isbn=978-0071638296 |location= |page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, Lehman had assets of $680 billion supported by only $22.5 billion of firm capital. From an equity position, its risky commercial real estate holdings were thirty times greater than capital. In such a highly leveraged structure, a 3 to 5 percent decline in real estate values would wipe out all capital.

== Collapse ==
{{Main|Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers}}

=== Causes ===

==== Malfeasance ====
A March 2010 report by the court-appointed examiner indicated that Lehman executives regularly used cosmetic accounting gimmicks at the end of each quarter to make its finances appear less shaky than they really were. This practice was a type of [[repurchase agreement]] that temporarily removed securities from the company's [[balance sheet]]. However, unlike typical repurchase agreements, these deals were described by Lehman as the outright sale of securities and created "a materially misleading picture of the firm’s financial condition in late 2007 and 2008."&lt;ref name="trumbull"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/0312/Lehman-Bros.-used-accounting-trick-amid-financial-crisis-and-earlier |author=Mark Trumbull |title=Lehman Bros. used accounting trick amid financial crisis – and earlier |work=The Christian Science Monitor |publisher=csmonitor.com |date=March 12, 2010 |accessdate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Subprime Mortgage Crisis ====

In August 2007, the firm closed its [[subprime lender]], BNC Mortgage, eliminating 1,200 positions in 23 locations, and took an after-tax charge of $25&amp;nbsp;million and a $27&amp;nbsp;million reduction in [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]]. Lehman said that poor market conditions in the mortgage space "necessitated a substantial reduction in its resources and capacity in the subprime space."&lt;ref name="street"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10375812/1/lehman-brothers-amputates-mortgage-arm.html |title=Lehman Brothers Amputates Mortgage Arm |author=Kulikowski, Laura |date=August 22, 2007 |accessdate=March 18, 2008 |publisher=[[TheStreet.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Lehman faced an unprecedented loss to the continuing [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. Lehman's loss was a result of having held on to large positions in subprime and other lower-rated mortgage [[tranche]]s when securitizing the underlying mortgages; whether Lehman did this because it was simply unable to sell the lower-rated bonds, or made a conscious decision to hold them, is unclear. In any event, huge losses accrued in lower-rated mortgage-backed securities throughout 2008. In the second fiscal quarter, Lehman reported losses of $2.8&amp;nbsp;billion and was forced to sell off $6&amp;nbsp;billion in assets.&lt;ref name=nytimes-crisis&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/29/business/29wall.html |title=Struggling Lehman Plans to Lay Off 1,500 |first=Jenny |last=Anderson |first2=Eric |last2=Dash |work=The New York Times |date=August 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of 2008 alone, Lehman stock lost 73% of its value as the credit market continued to tighten.&lt;ref name=nytimes-crisis/&gt; In August 2008, Lehman reported that it intended to release 6% of its work force, 1,500 people, just ahead of its third-quarter-reporting deadline in September.&lt;ref name=nytimes-crisis/&gt;

In September 2007, Joe Gregory appointed Erin Callan as CFO. On March 16, 2008, after rival [[Bear Stearns]] was taken over by [[JP Morgan Chase]] in a [[fire sale]], market analysts suggested that Lehman would be the next major investment bank to fall. Callan fielded Lehman's first quarter conference call, where the firm posted a profit of $489 million, compared to [[Citigroup]]'s $5.1 billion and [[Merrill Lynch]]'s $1.97 billion losses which was Lehman’s 55th consecutive profitable quarter. The firm's stock price leapt 46 percent after that announcement.&lt;ref name="nymag.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNmoney"&gt;{{cite news |title=I was lucky to get out |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/24/news/newsmakers/benner_callan.fortune/index.htm |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |author=Katie Benner |publisher=CNNmoney |date=September 26, 2008 |accessdate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sexist Language |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/2008/06/sexist_language_1.html |publisher=NPR Ombudsman |date=June 20, 2008 |accessdate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sellers"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Fall of a Wall Street Highflier |url=http://money.cnn.com/2010/03/08/news/companies/erin_callan_lehman.fortune/ |work=Fortune |date=March 8, 2010 |publisher=CNNmoney |accessdate=February 15, 2012 |first=Patricia |last=Sellers |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209114356/http://money.cnn.com/2010/03/08/news/companies/erin_callan_lehman.fortune/ |archivedate=December 9, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 9, 2008, Lehman Brothers announced US$2.8 billion second-quarter loss, its first since being spun off from [[American Express]], as market volatility rendered many of its hedges ineffective during that time. Lehman also reported that it had raised a further $6 billion in capital. As a result, there was major management shakeup, in which [[Hugh "Skip" McGee III]] (head of investment banking) held a meeting with senior staff to strip CEO Richard Fuld and his lieutenants of their authority. Consequently, Joe Gregory agreed to resign as president and COO, and afterward he told Erin Callan that she had to resign as CFO. Callan was appointed CFO of Lehman in 2008 but served only for six months, before departing after her mentor Joe Gregory was demoted.&lt;ref name="CNNmoney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sellers"/&gt; Bart McDade was named to succeed Gregory as president and COO, when several senior executives threatened to leave if he was not promoted. McDade took charge and brought back Michael Gelband and Alex Kirk, who had previously been pushed out of the firm by Gregory for not taking risks.  Although Fuld remained CEO, he soon became isolated from McDade's team.&lt;ref name="nymag.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10550089 |work=The New Zealand Herald |first1=Yalman |last1=Onaran |first2=John |last2=Helyar |title=The fall of Lehman Bros - Part 4 |date=December 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 22, 2008, shares in Lehman closed up 5% (16% for the week) on reports that the state-controlled [[Korea Development Bank]] was considering buying the bank.&lt;ref name="gain"&gt;{{cite news |work=The New York Times |first1=Jenny |last1=Anderson |first2=Landon, Jr. |last2=Thomas |date=August 22, 2008 |title=Lehman's Shares Gain on Signs of Raising Capital |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/23/business/worldbusiness/23lehman.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of those gains were quickly eroded as news came in that Korea Development Bank was "facing difficulties pleasing regulators and attracting partners for the deal."&lt;ref name="morcroft"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/financials-slip-as-korea-snags-weigh-on-lehman-and-merrill |title=Financials slip as Korea snags weigh on Lehman and Merrill |first=Greg |last=Morcroft |work=MarketWatch |date=September 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It culminated on September 9, when Lehman's shares plunged 45% to $7.79, after it was reported that the state-run South Korean firm had put talks on hold.&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iB5zn0q4MyPe4UpwVXIT03heWOEA |title=Lehman Brothers in freefall as hopes fade for new capital |author=Association of Funding Professionals |date=September 9, 2008 |accessdate=February 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421002953/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iB5zn0q4MyPe4UpwVXIT03heWOEA |archivedate=April 21, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investor confidence continued to erode as Lehman's stock lost roughly half its value and pushed the [[S&amp;P 500]] down 3.4% on September 9. The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones]] lost 300 points the same day on investors' concerns about the security of the bank.&lt;ref name=tp-0909&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2008/09/dow_plunges_nearly_300_points.html |title=Dow plunges nearly 300 points on concern about Lehman |work=Times-Picayune |place=[[New Orleans]] |date=September 9, 2008 |accessdate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government did not announce any plans to assist with any possible financial crisis that emerged at Lehman.&lt;ref name=nytimes-0909&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/10/business/10place.html |title=Wall Street's Fears on Lehman Bros.

The next day, Lehman announced a loss of $3.9&amp;nbsp;billion and its intent to sell off a majority stake in its investment-management business, which includes [[Neuberger Berman]].&lt;ref name=nytimes-0910&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/business/11lehman.html |title=Lehman Sees $3.9&amp;nbsp;billion Loss and Plans to Shed Assets |work=The New York Times |first=Ben |last=White |date=September 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ap-0910/&gt; The stock slid seven percent that day.&lt;ref name=ap-0910&gt;{{cite news |title=Lehman shares slip on plans to auction off unit, consider sale of company |first=Joe Bel |last=Bruno |agency=Associated Press |date=September 10, 2008 |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2008171076_weblehman10.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes-0911&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/business/11lehman.html |title=As Pressure Builds, Lehman Said to Be Looking for a Buyer |first=Jenny |last=Anderson |first2=Andrew Ross |last2=Sorkin |work=The New York Times |date=September 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lehman, after earlier rejecting questions on the sale of the company, was reportedly searching for a buyer as its stock price dropped another 40 percent on September 11, 2008.&lt;ref name=nytimes-0911/&gt;

Just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, executives at Neuberger Berman sent e-mail memos suggesting, among other things, that the Lehman Brothers' top people forgo multimillion-dollar bonuses to "send a strong message to both employees and investors that management is not shirking accountability for recent performance."&lt;ref name="biz.yahoo.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Fund Manager Wants $12.3 Million from Lehman  |date=September 9, 2009 |first=Patrick |last=Fitzgerald |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2009/09/11/fund-manager-wants-123m-from-lehman/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lehman Brothers Investment Management Director [[George Herbert Walker IV]] dismissed the proposal, going so far as to actually apologize to other members of the Lehman Brothers executive committee for the idea of bonus reduction having been suggested. He wrote, "Sorry team. I am not sure what's in the water at Neuberger Berman. I'm embarrassed and I apologize."&lt;ref name="biz.yahoo.com"/&gt;

=== Bankruptcy ===

On Saturday, September 13, 2008, [[Timothy F. Geithner]], then the president of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]], called a meeting on the future of Lehman, which included the possibility of an emergency liquidation of its assets.&lt;ref name=nytimes-0913&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/13/business/13rescue.html |title=U.S. Gives Banks Urgent Warning to Solve Crisis |first1=Jenny |last1=Anderson |first2=Eric |last2=Dash |first3=Vikas |last3=Bajaj |first4=Edmund |last4=Andrews |work=The New York Times |date=September 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lehman reported that it had been in talks with [[Bank of America]] and [[Barclays]] for the company's possible sale; however, both Barclays and Bank of America ultimately declined to purchase the entire company, in the former case because the British government (in particular, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Alastair Darling]] and the CEO of the [[Financial Services Authority]] [[Hector Sants]]) refused to allow the transaction at the last minute, quoting stockholder regulations in the UK, despite a deal having apparently been completed.&lt;ref name=nytimes-0913/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes-0914&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/business/15lehman.html |title=Lehman Heads Toward Brink as Barclays Ends Talks |first1=Ben |last1=White |first2=Jenny |last2=Anderson |work=The New York Times |date=September 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Barclays acquisition ====

On September 16, 2008, [[Barclays PLC]] announced that they would acquire a "stripped clean" portion of Lehman for $1.75&amp;nbsp;billion, including most of Lehman's North America operations.&lt;ref name="Barclays"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lehman, Workers Score Reprieve |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=September 17, 2008 |first1=Randall |last1=Smith |first2=Diya |last2=Gullapalli |first3=Jeffrey |last3=Mccracken |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122156586985742907 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 20, 2008, a revised version of the deal, a $1.35&amp;nbsp;billion (£700&amp;nbsp;million) plan for [[Barclays]] to acquire the core business of Lehman (mainly its $960-million headquarters, a 38-story office building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Emporis GmbH |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=lehmanbrostreetrsbuilding-newyorkcity-ny-usa |title=Lehman Brothers Building, New York City, U.S.A. |publisher=Emporis.com |accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Midtown Manhattan]], with responsibility for 9,000 former employees), was approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/reuters/feeds/reuters/2008/09/20/2008-09-20T061038Z_01_SP337267_RTRIDST_0_LEHMAN-BARCLAYS-UPDATE-3-PIX.html |title=US judge approves Lehman's asset sale to Barclays |publisher=Reuters/Forbes |date=September 20, 2008 |accessdate=September 20, 2008}}{{dead link|date=April 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7626624.stm |work=BBC News |title=Judge approves .3bn Lehman deal |date=September 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manhattan]] court bankruptcy Judge James Peck, after a 7-hour hearing, ruled: &lt;blockquote&gt;"I have to approve this transaction because it is the only available transaction. Lehman Brothers became a victim, in effect the only true icon to fall in a tsunami that has befallen the credit markets. This is the most momentous bankruptcy hearing I've ever sat through. It can never be deemed precedent for future cases.

Luc Despins, then a partner at [[Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy]], the creditors committee counsel, said: "The reason we're not objecting is really based on the lack of a viable alternative. We did not support the transaction because there had not been enough time to properly review it."{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} In the amended agreement, Barclays would absorb  $47.4&amp;nbsp;billion in securities and assume $45.5&amp;nbsp;billion in trading liabilities. Lehman's attorney [[Harvey R. Miller]] of [[Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges]], said "the purchase price for the real estate components of the deal would be $1.29&amp;nbsp;billion, including $960&amp;nbsp;million for Lehman's New York headquarters and $330&amp;nbsp;million for two New Jersey data centers. Lehman's original estimate valued its headquarters at $1.02&amp;nbsp;billion but an appraisal from CB Richard Ellis this week valued it at $900&amp;nbsp;million."{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Further, Barclays will not acquire Lehman's Eagle Energy unit, but will have entities known as Lehman Brothers Canada Inc, Lehman Brothers Sudamerica, Lehman Brothers Uruguay and its Private Investment Management business for high-net-worth individuals. Finally, Lehman will retain $20&amp;nbsp;billion of securities assets in Lehman Brothers Inc that are not being transferred to Barclays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chasan |first=Emily |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssFinancialServicesAndRealEstateNews/idUSN1932554220080920 |title=reuters.com, Judge approves Lehman, Barclays pact |agency=Reuters |date=September 20, 2008 |accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barclays acquired a potential liability of $2.5&amp;nbsp;billion to be paid as [[Severance package|severance]], if it chooses not to retain some Lehman employees beyond the guaranteed 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/feedarticle/7812904 theguardian.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921011455/http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/feedarticle/7812904 |date=September 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nomura acquisition ====

[[Nomura Holdings]], Japan's top brokerage firm, agreed to buy the Asian division of Lehman Brothers for $225&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/05/business/worldbusiness/05iht-deal06.1.16693801.html&lt;/ref&gt; and parts of the European division for a nominal fee of $2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5irbty-PmXfso7synFJmxNCXV1UqA Nomura paying two dollars for Lehman's Europe ops: report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929101345/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5irbty-PmXfso7synFJmxNCXV1UqA |date=September 29, 2008 }}, AFP, September 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aTPgq7SNvk_g&amp;refer=home Nomura Buys Lehman's Europe Banking, Equities Units], Bloomberg, September 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  It would not take on any trading assets or liabilities in the European units. Nomura negotiated such a low price because it acquired only Lehman's employees in the regions, and not its stocks, bonds or other assets. The last Lehman Brothers Annual Report identified that these non-US subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers were responsible for over 50% of global revenue produced.&lt;ref name="lehman.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lehman Brothers 2007 Annual Report |url=http://www.lehman.com/annual/2007/div_regions/intro.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322002013/http://www.lehman.com/annual/2007/div_regions/intro.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sale of asset management businesses ====

On September 29, 2008, Lehman agreed to sell Neuberger Berman, part of its investment management business, to a pair of private-equity firms, [[Bain Capital Partners]] and [[Hellman &amp; Friedman]], for $2.15&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-35745826_ITM Durchslag, Adam (October 1, 2008) "Bain and Hellman secure Neuberger: private equity houses Bain Capital and Hellman &amp; Friedman acquire Neuberger Berman from Lehman for US$2.15bn" ''Acquisitions Monthly''] from Access My Library&lt;/ref&gt;  The transaction was expected to close in early 2009, subject to approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court,&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/29/news/companies/Neuberger_sold.ap/index.htm Money.cnn.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930124953/http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/29/news/companies/Neuberger_sold.ap/index.htm |date=September 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but a competing bid was entered by the firm's management, who ultimately prevailed in a bankruptcy auction on December 3, 2008. Creditors of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. retain a 49% common equity interest in the firm, now known as Neuberger Berman Group LLC.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |last=De |first=Michael J. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/business/04lehman.html |title=Managers Win Auction for a Part of Lehman |work=The New York Times |date=December 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Europe, the Quantitative Asset Management Business has been acquired back by its employees on November 13, 2008 and has been renamed back to TOBAM.

=== Financial fallout ===
Lehman's bankruptcy was the largest failure of an investment bank since [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]] collapsed in 1990 amid fraud allegations.&lt;ref name=nytimes-0914-2/&gt; Immediately following the bankruptcy filing, an already distressed financial market began a period of extreme volatility, during which the Dow experienced its largest one day point loss, largest intra-day range (more than 1,000 points) and largest daily point gain. What followed was what many have called the "[[perfect storm]]" of economic distress factors and eventually a $700bn bailout package ([[Troubled Asset Relief Program]]) prepared by [[Henry Paulson]], [[US Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], and approved by Congress. The Dow eventually closed at a new six-year low of 7,552.29 on November 20, followed by a further drop to 6626 by March of the next year.

The fall of Lehman also had a strong effect on small private investors such as bond holders and holders of so-called [[Minibonds]]. In Germany structured products, often based on an index, were sold mostly to private investors, elderly, retired persons, students and families. Most of those now worthless derivatives were sold by the German arm of Citigroup, the German Citibank now owned by [[Crédit Mutuel]].{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}}

=== Ongoing litigation ===

On March 11, 2010, [[Anton R.

According to  ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', in March 2011, the SEC announced that they weren't confident that they could prove that Lehman Brothers violated US laws in its accounting practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lehman Probe Stalls; Chance of No Charges |first=Jean |last=Eaglesham |first2=Liz |last2=Rappaport |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=March 12, 2011 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703597804576194871565429108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2016, Lehman has already paid more than $105 billion to its unsecured creditors. In addition, JPMorgan will pay $1.42 billion in cash to settle a lawsuit accusing JPMorgan of draining Lehman Brothers liquidity right before the crash. The settlement would permit another $1.496 billion to be paid to creditors and a separate $76 million deposit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan-lehman-idUSKCN0V4049|title=JPMorgan to pay $1.42 billion cash to settle most Lehman claims|date=January 26, 2017|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The events of the weekend leading up to Lehman's bankruptcy were dramatized in ''[[The Last Days of Lehman Brothers]]'', a 2009 British-made television film.

In the 2010 animated film ''[[Despicable Me]]'', Lehman Brothers is referenced near the beginning. The main character Gru travels to the Bank of Evil, the bank that funds all evil plots for villains around the world, to try to take out a loan. As he passes under the banner with the bank's name, and under "Bank of Evil", in small letters, it reads, "Formerly Lehman Brothers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2002645,00.html|title=Despicable Me: It's Pickable!|last=Corliss|first=Richard|date=July 9, 2010|website=Time.com|publisher=TIME Magazine|access-date=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 American independent drama film ''[[Margin Call (film)|Margin Call]]'' focuses on the events of a 24-hour period at a large investment bank based on amalgam of large investment banks, drawing heavily from the culture of Lehman Brothers. (However, the events in the movie are primarily a depiction of the actions of [[Goldman Sachs]].)

The 2011 HBO movie ''[[Too Big to Fail (film)|Too Big to Fail]]'' recounted the days before Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and the fallout afterward.

The 2011 film [[Horrible Bosses]] had a character by the name of Kenny Sommerfield (played by [[P. J. Byrne]]) who worked at Lehman Brothers till its  bankruptcy, ending up broke.&lt;ref&gt;https://thefilmstage.com/martin-scorsese-adds-horrible-bosses-star-p-j-byrne-to-the-wolf-of-wall-street/&lt;/ref&gt;

The fall of Lehman Brothers is depicted in the 2015 movie ''[[The Big Short (film)|The Big Short]]'' where two of the characters walk around the Lehman Brothers offices after the bankruptcy to see the main trading floor.

In Imbolo Mbue's 2016 debut novel, ''[[Behold the Dreamers]]'', an immigrant from Cameroon is a chauffeur for Clark Edwards, an executive at Lehman Brothers.

''[[The Lehman Trilogy]]'' is a three-act play about the history of Lehman Brothers, by Italian dramatist Stefano Massini.
