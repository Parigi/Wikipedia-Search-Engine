The '''Pax Romana''' ([[Latin]] for "Roman Peace") is a roughly 200-year-long period in [[Roman Empire|Roman]] history which is identified with increased and sustained inner [[Pax Romana#Analogous peaces|hegemonial peace]] and [[golden age|stability]] (though not meaning without [[List of Roman wars and battles|wars]], [[Roman expansion|expansion]] and [[List of Roman civil wars and revolts|revolts]]).  It is traditionally dated as commencing from the accession of [[Caesar Augustus]], founder of the [[Roman principate]], in 27 BC and concluding in 180 AD with the death of [[Marcus Aurelius]], the last of the "good emperors".&lt;ref name=EncBrit&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/447447/Pax-Romana |title=Pax Romana |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was inaugurated by Augustus with the end of the [[Final War of the Roman Republic]], it is sometimes called the '''Pax Augusta'''. During this period of approximately two centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Head|first=Tom|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=rlU3DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=%22pax+romana%22+%22206+years%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8vTvUX_w7E&amp;sig=ACfU3U2moxQwcnkiJiXl4grpHIXEWOZr3A&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwislLmI9f3nAhVDxosKHRsHDCwQ6AEwA3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pax%20romana%22%20%22206%20years%22&amp;f=false|title=World History 101: From Ancient Mesopotamia and the Viking Conquests to NATO and WikiLeaks, an Essential Primer on World History|date=2017-10-03|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-5072-0454-2|language=en|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Roman Empire achieved its greatest territorial extent and its population reached a maximum of up to 70 million people.&lt;ref name=ushistory/&gt; According to [[Cassius Dio]], the dictatorial reign of [[Commodus]], later followed by the [[Year of the Five Emperors]] and the [[crisis of the third century]], marked the descent "from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust".&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius  [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/72*.html#36 72.36.4], Loeb edition translated E.

The Pax Romana is said to have been a "[[miracle]]" because prior to it there had never been peace for so many centuries in a given period of history. However, [[Walter Goffart]] wrote: "The volume of the [[The Cambridge Ancient History|''Cambridge Ancient History'']] for the years AD 70–192 is called 'The Imperial Peace', but peace is not what one finds in its pages".&lt;ref name="Goffart1989"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=55pDIwvWnpoC&amp;pg=PA111|title=Rome's Fall and After|publisher=Hambledon Press|year=1989|isbn=978-1-85285-001-2|page=111|author=Walter Goffart}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur M. Eckstein writes that the period must be seen in contrast to the much more frequent warfare in the [[Roman Republic]] in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. Eckstein also notes that the incipient Pax Romana appeared during the Republic, and that its temporal span varied with geographical region as well: "Although the standard textbook dates for the Pax Romana, the famous “Roman Peace” in the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]], are 31 BC to AD 250, the fact is that the Roman Peace was emerging in large regions of the Mediterranean at a much earlier date: [[Sicily]] after 210 [BC], the [[Italian Peninsula]] after 200 [BC]; the [[Po Valley]] after 190 [BC]; most of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] after 133 [BC]; [[North Africa]] after 100 [BC]; and for ever longer stretches of time in the [[Greek East and Latin West|Greek East]]."&lt;ref name="RosensteinMorstein-Marx2011"&gt;{{cite book|editors=Nathan Rosenstein and Robert Morstein-Marx|title=A Companion to the Roman Republic|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C4rmmvFAKjoC&amp;pg=PA574|origyear=2006|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5720-2|page=574|chapter=Conceptualizing Roman Imperial Expansion under the Republic: An Introduction|author= Arthur M. Eckstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known record of the term ''Pax Romana'' appears in a writing by [[Seneca the Younger]] in AD 55.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ali Parchami|title=Hegemonic Peace and Empire: The Pax Romana, Britannica and Americana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pwt6AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-00704-2|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was highly influential, and the subject of theories and attempts to copy it in subsequent ages. [[Arnaldo Momigliano]] noted that "''Pax Romana'' is a simple formula for [[propaganda]], but a difficult subject for research."&lt;ref name="Momi"/&gt; In fact, the "Pax Romana" was broken by the [[First Jewish–Roman War]], the [[Kitos War]] (also in Judea, 115–117), the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Kokhba Revolt]] (also known as the Third Jewish–Roman War), the [[Roman–Parthian War of 58–63]], Trajan's [[Trajan|Roman–Parthian War]] of 113, the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]], various battles with Germanic tribes, including the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|Teutoburg Forest]], and [[Boudica]]'s war in Britain in AD 60 or 61.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

The Pax Romana began when Octavian (Augustus) defeated [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]] in the [[Battle of Actium]] on 2 September 31 BC and became Roman emperor.&lt;ref name=EncBrit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Battles&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul K. |last=Davis |authorlink=Paul K.

Lacking a good precedent of successful one-man rule, Augustus created a [[Military junta|junta]] of the greatest military magnates and stood as the front man. By binding together these leading magnates in a coalition, he eliminated the prospect of [[civil war]]. The Pax Romana was not immediate, despite the end of the civil wars, because fighting continued in [[Hispania]] and in the [[Alps]]. Nevertheless, Augustus closed the [[Gates of Janus]] (a ceremony indicating that Rome was at peace) three times,&lt;ref&gt;Augustus states in ''Res Gestae'' 13 that he closed the Gates three times, a fact documented by many other historians (See [[Gates of Janus]]).&lt;/ref&gt; first in 29 BC and again in 25 BC. The third closure is undocumented, but [[Inez Scott Ryberg]] (1949) and Gaius Stern (2006) have persuasively dated the third closure to 13 BC with the commissioning of the [[Ara Pacis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Procession of the Ara Pacis |first=Inez |last=Scott Ryberg |authorlink=Inez Scott Ryberg |journal=Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome |volume=19 |year=1949 |pages=77, 79–101 |doi=10.2307/4238621|jstor=4238621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stern&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=agPYfLmueWEC |title=Women, children, and senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae: A study of Augustus' vision of a new world order in 13 BCE. |first=Gaius |last=Stern |publisher=ProQuest |year=2010 |origyear=2006 |isbn=978-0-549-83411-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[Ronald Syme]] had suggested a later date (but Rome was then at war).&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of the [[Ludi Saeculares]] in 17 BC the Concept of Peace was publicized, and in 13 BC was proclaimed when Augustus and [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] jointly returned from pacifying the provinces. The order to construct the Ara Pacis was no doubt part of this announcement.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Augustus faced a problem making peace an acceptable mode of life for the [[Demography of the Roman Empire|Romans]], who had been at war with one power or another continuously for 200 years.&lt;ref name=Stern/&gt; Romans regarded peace, not as an absence of war, but the rare situation which existed when all opponents had been beaten down and lost the ability to resist.&lt;ref name="Momi"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=750454 |title=The Peace of the Ara Pacis |first=Arnaldo |last=Momigliano | journal=Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes |volume=5 |year=1942 |pages=228–231 |doi=10.2307/750454 |url=https://people.exeter.ac.uk/jda208/The%20Peace%20of%20the%20Ara%20Pacis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus' challenge was to persuade Romans that the prosperity they could achieve in the absence of warfare was better for the Empire than the potential wealth and honor acquired when fighting a risky war. Augustus succeeded by means of skillful propaganda. [[List of Roman emperors|Subsequent emperors]] followed his lead, sometimes producing lavish ceremonies to close the Gates of Janus, issuing coins with Pax on the reverse, and patronizing literature extolling the benefits of the Pax Romana.&lt;ref name=Stern/&gt;

After Augustus' death in AD 14, most of his successors as Roman emperors continued his politics.  The last five emperors of the Pax Romana were considered the "[[Five Good Emperors]]".&lt;ref name=ushistory/&gt;

==Influence on trade==
Roman trade in the Mediterranean increased during the Pax Romana.  Romans sailed East to acquire silks, gems, onyx and spices.  Romans benefited from large profits and incomes in the Roman empire were raised due to trade in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Roman market economy|last=Temin|first=Peter|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691147680|location=Princeton|pages=13|language=English|oclc = 784708336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pax Romana : war, peace, and conquest in the Roman world|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian Keith|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780300178821|location=New Haven|pages=392|oclc=941874968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, the [[German Empire]]'s imperial peace of 1871 (over its internal components like [[Saxony]]) slowly evolved into the later German state. As a counter-example, the imperial peace of [[Alexander the Great]]'s empire dissolved because the Greek [[city states]] maintained their political identity and more importantly, embryos of their own armed forces. [[Raymond Aron|Aron]] notes that during the Pax Romana, the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish war]] was a reminder that the overlapping of the imperial institutions over the local ones did not erase them and the overlap was a source of tension and flare-ups. Aron summarizes that, "In other words, ''imperial peace'' becomes civil peace insofar as the memory of the previously independent political units are effaced, insofar as individuals within a pacified zone feel themselves less united to the traditional or local community and more to the conquering state."&lt;ref name="Aron2003"/&gt;

The concept of Pax Romana was highly influential, and attempts to  imitate it occurred in the [[Byzantine Empire]], and in the [[Christian West]], where it morphed into the [[Peace and Truce of God]] (''pax Dei'' and ''treuga Dei'').&lt;ref name="Gress"/&gt; A theoretician of the imperial peace during the Middle Ages was [[Dante Aligheri]]. Dante's works on the topic were analyzed at the beginning of the 20th century by [[William Mitchell Ramsay]] in the book ''The Imperial Peace; An Ideal in European History'' (1913).&lt;ref name="Scott2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[James Brown Scott]]|title=Law, the State, and the International Community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o2ItplkkogIC&amp;pg=PA223|year=2002|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-58477-178-4|pages=223–224|origyear=1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/imperialpeaceide00ramsrich|title=The imperial peace; an ideal in European history|work=Internet Archive|publisher=Oxford, The Clarendon Press|year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;
