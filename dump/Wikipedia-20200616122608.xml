'''Solar power in Australia''' is a fast growing industry. As of September 2019, [[Australia|Australia's]] over 2.2 million solar PV installations had a combined capacity of 13,904 MW [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] (PV) [[solar power]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pv-map.apvi.org.au/analyses|title=Australian PV market since April 2001|work=apvi.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 3,290 MW were installed in the preceding 12 months. In 2019, 59 solar PV projects with a combined capacity of 2,881 MW were either under construction, constructed or due to start construction having reached financial closure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://assets.cleanenergycouncil.org.au/documents/resources/reports/clean-energy-australia/clean-energy-australia-report-2019.pdf|title=Clean Energy Australia Report 2019|website=Clean Energy Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://52.63.206.133/|title=Australian Energy Market Operator|last=#|date=2013-09-17|website=Australian Energy Market Operator|language=en|access-date=2019-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solar accounted for 5.2% (or 11.7 TWh) of Australia's total electrical energy production (227.8 TWh) in 2018.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The sudden rise in Solar PV installations in Australia since 2018 dramatically propelled the country from being considered a relative laggard to a strong contender in Solar PV development by mid 2019. With an installed photovoltaic capacity of 12,959 MW as of June 2019, Australia ranks among the [[Solar power by country|world's top ten solar countries]] by capacity and ranks second on a watts per capita basis with 459 watts per capita to [[Solar power in Germany|Germany]] with 548 watts per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/statistics/IEA-PVPS_T1_35_Snapshot2019-Report.pdf|title=IEA PV Snapshot 2019|access-date=14 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The installed PV capacity in Australia increased 10-fold between 2009 and 2011, and quadrupled between 2011 and 2016. 
The first commercial-scale PV power plant, the 1 MW ''Uterne Solar Power Station'', was opened in 2011.&lt;ref name="AliceSolarCity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alicesolarcity.com.au/uterne-solar-power-station |title=Uterne Solar Power Station|work=alicesolarcity.com.au |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125163756/http://www.alicesolarcity.com.au/uterne-solar-power-station |archivedate=25 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Greenough River Solar Farm]] opened in 2012 with a capacity of 10 MW.&lt;ref name="Greenough"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/10/australia-greenough-river-solar-power_n_1953190.html Australia's Greenough River Solar Farm Opens Amid Renewable Target Debate], Reuters, Rebekah Kebede, 9 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 
The price of photovoltaics has been decreasing, and in January 2013, was less than half the cost of using [[grid power|grid electricity]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2013/01/07/solar-electricity-now-under-half-the-cost-of-grid-power-for-australian-households/|title=Solar Electricity Now Under Half The Cost Of Grid Power For Australian Households|work=CleanTechnica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia has historically been internationally criticised for producing very little of its energy from solar power, despite its vast resources, extensive sunshine and overall high potential.&lt;ref name=sunniest&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/sunniest-places-countries-world.php |title=Sunniest places in the world |publisher=Current Results.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-25751086|title=Is Australia falling out of love with solar power?|work=[[BBC News]]|date=5 February 2014|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/08/15/3471837/queensland-energy-fee-kills-solar/|title=In Australia, businesses are getting hit with a $500 fee designed to kill solar power|work=ThinkProgress|date=15 August 2014|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reneweconomy.com.au/2014/us-solar-giant-quits-australia-due-policy-uncertainty-63071|title=US solar giant quits Australia|work=Renew Economy|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ausrenewpolicy"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byrnes |first=L. |last2=Brown |first2=C. |last3=Foster |first3=J. |last4=Wagner |first4=L. |date=December 2013 |title=Australian renewable energy policy: Barriers and challenges |journal=Renewable Energy |volume=60 |pages=711–721 |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2013.06.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest share of solar PV installations in 2018 was from grid-connected distributed sources totalling 8,030 MW. These are rooftop systems in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. For the purposes of the data, residential grid connect are systems &lt;9.5 kW, commercial are systems between 9.5 and 99.9 kW and industrial are 100 kW to 5 MW. Grid connected-centralised plants was the next largest sector in 2018 with 3,272 MW installed, representing utility scale ground mounted solar with a power rating &gt; 5 MW. Off-grid solar PV was the smallest segment at 284 MW in 2018.

Growth accelerated dramatically during 2018 in both rooftop distributed solar and utility-scale solar which became a significant component by the end of the year. 

By year end 2018, Australia had 1.96 million residential rooftop solar systems and 78,000 commercial and industrial rooftop solar systems, for a total of 2.04 million total rooftop PV systems.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
Over 200,000 were installed in 2018 alone and the country was on track to install as many again in 2019. Australia leads the world in residential uptake of solar, with a nation-wide average of free-standing households with a PV system at over 20%.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Potential ==
[[File:Australia GHI mid-size-map 156x171mm-300dpi v20191205.png|thumb|Solar potential in Australia]]

=== Insolation potential ===
The combination of [[Climate of Australia|Australia's dry climate]] and latitude give it high benefits and potential for solar energy production. Most of the Australian continent receives in excess of {{convert|4|kWh}} per square metre per day of [[insolation]] during winter months, with a region in the north exceeding {{convert|6|kWh}} per square metre per day. Australia's insolation greatly exceeds the average values in Europe, Russia, and most of North America. Comparable levels are found in desert areas of northern and southern Africa, south western United States and adjacent area of Mexico, and regions on the Pacific coast of South America. However, the areas of highest insolation are distant to Australia's population centres.

=== Roof top solar potential ===
According to The Institute for Sustainable Futures, the School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering (SPREE) at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) Australia has the potential to install 179 GW of solar power on roofs across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2019/06/13/australia-could-install-179-gw-of-rooftop-solar/|title=Australia could install 179 GW of rooftop solar|website=pv magazine Australia|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2018 Australia had just over 8 GW of rooftop solar.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Even with Australia newly emerged as being amongst the world leaders in solar uptake, the study found that as of June 2019 Australia was using less than 5% of the potential capacity for rooftop solar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2019/06/13/australia-could-install-179-gw-of-rooftop-solar/|title=Australia could install 179 GW of rooftop solar|website=pv magazine Australia|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that the combined annual output from rooftop solar could theoretically reach 245 TWh, more than the current annual grid consumption of just under 200 TWh per year. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pv-magazine-australia.com/2019/06/13/australia-could-install-179-gw-of-rooftop-solar/|title=Australia could install 179 GW of rooftop solar|website=pv magazine Australia|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incentives ==


=== Rebates ===
The Solar Homes and Communities Plan was a rebate provided by the Australian Government of up to A$8,000 for installing solar panels on homes and community use buildings (other than schools).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/settlements/renewable/pv/index.html Solar Homes and Communities Plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203183854/http://environment.gov.au/settlements/renewable/pv/index.html |date=3 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This rebate was phased out on 8 June 2009, to be replaced by the Solar Credits Program, where an installation of a solar system would receive 5 times as many Renewable Energy Certificates for the first 1.5 kilowatts of capacity under the Renewable Energy Target (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orer.gov.au|title=Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504235738/http://www.orer.gov.au/|archivedate=4 May 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools were eligible to apply for grants of up to A$50,000 to install 2&amp;nbsp;kW solar panels and other measures through the National Solar Schools Program beginning on 1 July 2008, which replaced the Green Vouchers for Schools program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/programs/greenvouchers/index.html|title=The National Solar Schools Program is on the way|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications for the program ended 21 November 2012. A total of 2,870 schools have installed solar panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatechange.gov.au/government/initiatives/national-solar-schools.aspx|title=National Solar Schools Program|work=climatechange.gov.au|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The output of each array can be viewed, and compared with that of up to four other schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarschools.net/|title=solarschools.net :: Data Monitoring|work=solarschools.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorian state government is assisting homeowners and tenants by providing a rebate of up to $1,888 and an interest-free loan of an equivalent amount to their Solar PV panel rebate amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.solar.vic.gov.au/solar-panel-rebate|title=Solar Panel Rebate |publisher=Solar Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ipromiseaustralia.com.au/government-solar-rebate-2020-victoria-check-eligibility/|title=Government Solar Rebate 2020 in Victoria |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feed-in tariffs and direct action ===
{{Main|Feed-in tariffs in Australia}}
A number of states have set up schemes to encourage the uptake of solar PV power generation involving households installing solar panels and selling excess electricity to electricity retailers to put into the electricity grid, widely called "feed-in". Each scheme involves the setting of [[feed in tariff]]s, which can be classified by a number of factors including the price paid, whether it is on a net or gross export basis, the length of time payments are guaranteed, the maximum size of installation allowed and the type of customer allowed to participate. Many Australian state feed-in tariffs were net export tariffs, whereas conservation groups argued for gross feed-in tariffs. In March 2009, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) started a solar gross feed-in tariff. For systems up to 10&amp;nbsp;kW the payment was 50.05 cents per kWh. For systems from 10&amp;nbsp;kW to 30&amp;nbsp;kW the payment was 40.04 cents per kWh. The payment was revised downward once before an overall capacity cap was reached and the scheme closed. Payments are made quarterly based on energy generated and the payment rate is guaranteed for 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/144645/FiTFactSheet.pdf|title=ACT Govt. Feed In Tariff factsheet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matthewb.id.au/media/Solar_Power_Calculator.html|title=Solar Power Calculator|author=Matthew Bulat|work=matthewb.id.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[South Australia]], a solar feed-in tariff was introduced for households and an educational program that involved installing solar PV on the roofs of major public buildings such as the Adelaide Airport, State Parliament, Museum, Art Gallery and several hundred public schools.&lt;ref&gt;Centre for National Policy, What States Can Do: Climate Change Policy, April 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the Queensland government introduced the Affordable Energy Plan offering interest free loans for solar panels and solar storage in an effort to increase the uptake of solar energy in the state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gienergy.com.au/3-new-queensland-government-interest-free-loans-solar-storage-2018/ 3 new Queensland Government Interest-free loans for solar and storage in 2018], June 29, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 [[Premier of South Australia|Premier]] [[Mike Rann]] announced funding for $8 million worth of solar panels on the roof of the new Goyder Pavilion at the [[Royal Adelaide Showgrounds]], the largest rooftop solar installation in Australia, qualifying it for official "power station" status.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/ June 2, 2008. "Adelaide Showgrounds to have nations biggest solar power project"&lt;/ref&gt;  South Australia has the highest per capita take up of household solar power in Australia.

== Renewable energy targets ==
{{Main|Energy policy of Australia#Renewable energy targets}}
In 2001, the Australian government introduced a mandatory renewable energy target (MRET) designed to ensure renewable energy achieves a 20% share of electricity supply in Australia by 2020. The MRET was to increase new generation from 9,500 gigawatt-hours to 45,000 gigawatt-hours by 2020. The MRET requires wholesale purchasers of electricity (such as electricity retailers or industrial operations) to purchase renewable energy certificates (RECs), created through the generation of electricity from renewable sources, including wind, hydro, [[landfill gas]] and geothermal, as well as solar PV and solar thermal. The objective is to provide a stimulus and additional revenue for these technologies. The scheme was proposed to continue until 2030.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orer.gov.au/legislation/index.html Australian Government: Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026164549/http://www.orer.gov.au/legislation/index.html |date=26 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the MRET was divided into large-scale and small-scale goals in 2011 and reductions by the Abbott government, Australia has a goal of 33,000 GWh of renewable energy from large sources by 2020, or 23.5% of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/RET/About-the-Renewable-Energy-Target/History-of-the-scheme|title=Renewable Energy Target - History of the scheme|date=30 November 2016|website=www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subsidy funding ===
The Solar Flagships program sets aside $1.6 billion for [[solar power]] over six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/BudgetReview200910/ClimateEnergy |title= Budget 2009 10: Climate change and energy| publisher= Parliament of Australia |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government funding is for 4 new solar plants that produce coal plant scale power (in total up to 1000&amp;nbsp;MW - coal plants typically produce 500 to 2,000&amp;nbsp;MW). This subsidy would need additional funding from the plant builders and/or operators. As a comparison Abengoa Solar, a company currently constructing solar thermal plants, put the cost of a 300&amp;nbsp;MW plant at €1.2 billion in 2007. In 2009, the Arizona state government announced a 200&amp;nbsp;MW plant for US$1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenmodesustainabilitydevelopments.blogspot.com/2009/05/big-solar-for-oz.html|title=GreenMode Sustainability Developments: Big Solar for Oz|work=greenmodesustainabilitydevelopments.blogspot.com|date=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcommerce.com/Newsroom/ViewRelease.aspx?1971 |title=404 |work=azcommerce.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513230250/http://www.azcommerce.com/Newsroom/ViewRelease.aspx?1971 |archivedate=13 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australian Capital Territory ===
A 20 MWp solar power plant has been built on 50 hectares of land in [[Royalla]], a rural part of the [[Australian Capital Territory]] south of [[Canberra]]. It is powered by 83,000 solar panels, and can power 4,400 homes. It was officially opened on 3 September 2014. It is the first solar plant facility in the Australian capital, and at the time of building the largest such plant in Australia. The facility was built by a Spanish company, Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV).&lt;ref name="ABC5716500"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-03/royalla-solar-farm-opens-south-of-canberra/5716500 'Australia's largest' solar farm opens at Royalla south of Canberra], Jonathon Gul and Kathleen Dyett, [[ABC News Online]], 3 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenpowerco.com.au/big-solar-power-a-big-deal-in-the-act-and-beyond/|title=Big Solar Power a Big Deal in the ACT and Beyond - The Green Power Company|work=The Green Power Company - Solar Power Systems|date=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Northern Territory ===
There are 30 solar concentrator dishes at three locations in the [[Northern Territory]]: [[Hermannsburg, Northern Territory|Hermannsburg]], [[Yuendumu, Northern Territory|Yuendumu]] and [[Lajamanu, Northern Territory|Lajamanu]]. [[Solar Systems (company)|Solar Systems]] and the Federal government were involved in the projects.

The solar concentrator dish power stations together generate 720&amp;nbsp;kW and 1,555,000 kWh per year, representing a saving of 420,000 litres of diesel and 1,550 tonnes of [[greenhouse gas emissions]].&lt;ref name="ssp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarsystems.com.au/projects.html|title=Solar Systems - Solar Systems|website=www.solarsystems.com.au|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218145048/http://www.solarsystems.com.au/projects.html|archivedate=18 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solar power stations at these three remote indigenous communities in Australia's [[Northern Territory]] are constructed using Solar Systems' CS500 concentrator dish systems. The project cost A$7M, offset by a grant from the Australian and Northern Territory Governments under their Renewable Remote Power Generation Program.&lt;ref name="solarsystems.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarsystems.com.au/SPSA+case+study.pdf|title=Solar Systems - Solar Systems|website=www.solarsystems.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Solar Cities in Australia}}

''Solar Cities'' is a demonstration program designed to promote solar power, smart meters, and energy conservation in urban locations throughout Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatechange.gov.au/government/initiatives/solar-cities.aspx|title=Solar Cities|work=climatechange.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One such location is [[Townsville]], [[Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2006/9/26/townsville-set-to-become-a-solar-city|title=TOWNSVILLE SET TO BECOME A SOLAR CITY|work=statements.qld.gov.au|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2007/5/3/contract-signing-a-key-milestone-in-solar-city-project|title=CONTRACT SIGNING A KEY MILESTONE IN SOLAR CITY PROJECT|work=statements.qld.gov.au|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renewable Energy Master Plan 2030 ===

The Council of Sydney is attempting to make the city run 100% on renewable energy by 2030. This plan was announced earlier in 2014 with the blueprints made public on their 
website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/153282/Renewable-Energy-Master-Plan.pdf|title=The Decentralised Energy Master Plan – Renewable Energy|date=December 2013|website=City of Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ambitious plan was recently awarded the 2014 [[Eurosolar]] prize in the category of "Towns/municipalities, council districts and public utilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurosolar.de/en/index.php/media-mainmenu-61/press-releases-mainmenu-17/658-winners-of-european-solar-prize-2014-honored-in-rome|title=Winners of Eurosolar Prize 2014|work=EUROSOLAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;
