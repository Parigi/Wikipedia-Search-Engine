"'''What Goes Around.../...Comes Around (Interlude)'''" is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter [[Justin Timberlake]] for his second studio album, ''[[FutureSex/LoveSounds]]'' (2006). It was written and produced by Timberlake, [[Timbaland]], and [[Danja (producer)|Danja]]. The song was said by Timberlake to be about betrayal and forgiveness, and was described by some music critics as a "sequel" to his 2002 single "[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]". The song received generally positive reviews from music critics.

The song was retitled "'''What Goes Around... Comes Around'''" for its December 19, 2006, release as the third single from ''FutureSex/LoveSounds''. It became Timberlake's third consecutive number-one hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Internationally the song was also successful, reaching the top ten in countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Germany, and Australia. The song was later certified two-times [[List of music recording certifications|platinum]] in Australia, [[RIAA certification|gold]] in the United States and [[List of music recording certifications|gold]] in New Zealand. The song won [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] at the [[50th Grammy Awards]], where it also received a nomination for [[Record of the Year]].

The [[Samuel Bayer]]-directed music video for "What Goes Around... Comes Around" was released February 7, 2007. Actress [[Scarlett Johansson]] plays Timberlake's love interest in the video. The video received the award for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]] at the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards]] and was also nominated for [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]].

When Timberlake began working on ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' at [[Timbaland]]'s studio in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]],&lt;ref name="Jennifer"&gt;{{cite news |last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |title=Road to the Grammys: Justin Wanted To Channel Coldplay On FutureSex/LoveSounds |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1552019/20070208/timberlake_justin.jhtml |publisher=MTV News |date=February 9, 2007 |accessdate=February 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vineyard"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |title=Justin Timberlake's Fooling 'Around' Resulted in Award-Nominated Song: Behind The Grammys |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1581045/20080206/timberlake_justin.jhtml |publisher=MTV News |date=February 8, 2008 |accessdate=February 15, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mtv.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F1581045%2F20080206%2Ftimberlake_justin.jhtml&amp;date=2011-09-29 |archivedate=September 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; they had no idea of what the album would be like with no plan for it or even a title.&lt;ref name="Vineyard"/&gt; He told his collaborators to do a remake of his previous single, "[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]".&lt;ref name="Vineyard"/&gt; Danja, a protégé of Timbaland, stated: "We had no direction at all other than 'Cry Me a River,' and not in the sense of mimicking the track, but in how big the song was. There was no direction for how he wanted the song to sound, because there was no direction for how he wanted [his album ''FutureSex/LoveSounds''] to sound."&lt;ref name="Vineyard"/&gt;

The song was written and produced by Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, and [[Danja (musician)|Nate "Danja" Hills]]. While in the studio, the three men were just "fooling around" and "freestyling".&lt;ref name="Vineyard"/&gt; When Danja began playing a guitar [[riff]], it caught Timberlake's attention. Timberlake started humming to the [[melody]], and then the lyrics came. Timbaland, who was at his keyboards beside Danja, added drums to the melody. Danja commented that "everything was coming together at the same time".&lt;ref name="Vineyard"/&gt; After coming up with the music, Timberlake never wrote down the lyrics and, in an hour, he was ready to record it. By the time Timberlake was in the vocal booth, the basic track was done, then Timbaland produced a [[prelude (music)|prelude]] of the song. Timberlake sang the song in a couple of takes and went back line by line to fill up the gaps. During the recording sessions, Timbaland and Danja added everything else, including the basses and strings. Danja compared the process to scoring to a movie, thinking the song was like a horror flick.&lt;ref name="Vineyard"/&gt;

"What Goes Around... Comes Around" was pivotal to the creation of ''FutureSex/LoveSounds''. After finishing the production of the song, Timbaland teased Timberlake. Timberlake responded: "Let's do something we would never do. Let's go far left and just see what happens."&lt;ref name="Vineyard"/&gt; His answer motivated the collective, and they ended up producing ten songs for the album.&lt;ref name="Jennifer"/&gt;

==Composition and interpretation==
{{listen|filename=Justin Timberlake - What Goes Around...-...Comes Around.ogg|title="What Goes Around.../...Comes Around"
|description=A sample of "What Goes Around.../...Comes Around" |pos=right |format=[[Ogg]]}}
"What Goes Around.../...Comes Around" is performed in a slow manner.&lt;ref name="Sheet"&gt;{{cite web |title=Justin Timberlake Digital Sheet Music: What Goes Around |url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0056580 |work=Musicnotes |accessdate=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed in the [[key (music)|key]] of A [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] ([[A Minor]]) in [[common time]]. With a gentle and midtempo beat,&lt;ref name="Lamb"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lamb |first=Bill |title=Justin Timberlake "What Goes Around..."(review) |url=http://top40.about.com/od/singles/gr/jtwhatgoes.htm |work=About entertainment |accessdate=January 15, 2007 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/668mBLEBz?url=http://top40.about.com/od/singles/gr/jtwhatgoes.htm |archive-date=March 13, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; the tempo is pacing to 76 [[beats per minute]].&lt;ref name="Sheet"/&gt; The song features a two-minute [[Break (music)|interlude]] titled "Comes Around", featuring the album's producer [[Timbaland]], spanning to a seven-minute and 28-second track. Timberlake's voice ranges from B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Sheet"/&gt; Musically, the song is similar to the type of music produced on Timberlake's ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]'' album; however, it is the only link from ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' to ''Justified''.&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Moss |first=Corey |title=Justin's Future Shock |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/t/timberlake_justin/news_feature_081506/index2.jhtml |publisher=MTV News |accessdate=February 15, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106121310/http://www.mtv.com/bands/t/timberlake_justin/news_feature_081506/index2.jhtml |archivedate=November 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of the song, there is a five-second harmony line of two [[bağlama]]s (one each panned far left and far right on respect octaves), a Turkish folk instrument. The beat is then changed to a more upbeat version of the same melody with more percussion. The basic ornamentation is loyal to characteristic Turkish string ornamentations. Timbaland also used the Turkish oud to mellow out the guitar [[riff]].&lt;ref name="Vineyard"/&gt; The chord series follows the Am-C-G-D keys. Following the instrumental, Timberlake begins the verse at thirteenth [[bar (music)|bar]]. The original track had a [[bridge (music)|bridge]], including the pre-verses, the verses and the choruses. After hearing the vocals of Timberlake, they decided to remove the bridge and follow a simple flow, because they felt its "too much" to have it and a [[break (music)|break]] at the end of the song.&lt;ref name="Vineyard"/&gt; Timbaland provides backing vocals on the song.

"What Goes Around.../...Comes Around" is about betrayal and forgiveness.&lt;ref name="SonyBMGAus"&gt;{{Cite news |title=JT Comes Around With New Single in Stores This Saturday |url=http://www.sonymusic.com.au/news/details.do?newsId=20030829004359 |work=Sony BMG Australia |date=March 17, 2007 |accessdate=February 23, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909094326/http://www.sonymusic.com.au/news/details.do?newsId=20030829004359 |archive-date=September 9, 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Timberlake revealed that the song was written for the experience his friend went through.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; However, the public came up with different interpretation of the lyrics, that being a sequel to "[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me A River]]". Bill Lamb wrote that the song has a "cautionary tale in the lyrics".&lt;ref name="Lamb"/&gt; According to him, many fans and critics alike, after hearing the song, insisted that it is similar in meaning to "Cry Me a River", which allegedly accounts to Timberlake's relationship with former girlfriend, pop singer [[Britney Spears]].&lt;ref name="Lamb"/&gt; However, Timberlake's account of the song's meaning contradicts this. Spence D. of [[IGN]] commented that the song presents "some intriguing ambiance".&lt;ref name="Spence"/&gt;

The song received generally positive reviews from critics. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called the single "a soaring ballad featuring Timberlake's falsetto, with verses and choruses that pile on top of one another with dizzying effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Scaggs |first=Austin |title=Timberlake Returns |newspaper=Rolling Stone |date=July 13, 2007 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[About.com]] reviewer Bill Lamb stated that the song "is one of the most gorgeous pop melodies of the year." He complimented the string-based arrangement of the song.&lt;ref name="Lamb"/&gt; Chris Willman of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called it "superior", along with "[[LoveStoned]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Willman |first=Chris |title=FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006): Justin Timberlake |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1532765,00.html |work=Entertainment Weekly |publisher=Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc. |date=September 8, 2006 |accessdate=February 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zach Baron of [[Pitchfork Media]] referred to it "some real can't-let-go shit that'll save you the repeat stabs on the bad night."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Baron |first=Zach |title=Justin Timberlake: "What Goes Around.../...Comes Around Interlude" |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/track_review/38235-what-goes-aroundcomes-around-interlude |work=Pitchfork Media |publisher=Pitchfork Media Inc. |date=September 1, 2006 |accessdate=February 23, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307125906/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/track_review/38235-what-goes-aroundcomes-around-interlude |archive-date=March 7, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spence D. of [[IGN]] called it "annoying" but he complimented the use of echo vocals and swirling synths.&lt;ref name="Spence"&gt;{{cite web |last=D. |first=Spence |title=Justin Timberlake – Futuresex/Lovesounds |url=http://music.ign.com/articles/732/732876p1.html |work=IGN |date=September 14, 2006 |accessdate=February 23, 2008 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/668mBr66Q?url=http://music.ign.com/articles/732/732876p1.html |archive-date=March 13, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later reviews, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Katie Atkinson noted "with a whopping 7:28 running time, it was a very long single.

===Synopsis===
The video starts off with Timberlake flirting with Johansson on the [[burlesque]]-style club. She rejects with a tease at first but eventually leaves with him to go back to his place. In between cuts, they are shown in bed caressing each other. Johansson jumps into a pool outside the house, and floats below the surface as if she is drowning. Timberlake runs out and pulls her up; she laughs at Timberlake and kisses him.

In another scene, Timberlake introduces her to a drunk [[Shawn Hatosy]] at the club calling her "The One". Hatosy seems to be interested in Johansson and Timberlake asks him to "keep an eye on her for me", perhaps suspecting she has another man on the side. Timberlake returns and finds them kissing in the stairway. After punching Hatosy, he chases after Johansson, who speeds off in her 1967 [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|Corvette Sting Ray]]; Timberlake follows in his [[Porsche Carrera GT]]. Johansson runs into a fiery car crash pile up and is ejected from the car as it tumbles through the air and lands several feet away 2 times. Timberlake notices Johansson's motionless body lying supine on the ground. He gets out and kneels over her while the camera view moves toward the sky. The end of the video references the ending of 1960 movie [[BUtterfield 8]] in which Gloria, the main character portrayed by [[Elizabeth Taylor]], dies in the same manner, with the scenes sharing many similar shots.

Some scenes shows Timberlake performing on the stairway with a microphone while a group of unknown girls with red paint on their eyes are seen dancing next to him while one (Johansson) is seen waving her batons with fire on them near the end of the video.
