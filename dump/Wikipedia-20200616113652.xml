'''Hollywood''' is a town in [[Jackson County, Alabama|Jackson County]], northeast [[Alabama]], United States. As of the 2010 census, the population of the town was 1,000, up from 950 in 2000. Hollywood is considered a suburb of [[Scottsboro, Alabama|Scottsboro]], the county seat. The town is the site of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s never-completed [[Bellefonte Nuclear Generating Station]]. The TVA sold the plant, and as of 2018, it is to be developed by private interests.

==History==
Originally established as Samples on December 14, 1883, the town was renamed as Hollywood on May 13, 1887. It formally incorporated on May 24, 1897, and held its first election June 8 of that year.

In 1994, it and 10 other towns named Hollywood successfully fought [[Hollywood, California]]'s attempt to trademark its name and force same-named communities to pay royalties to it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al.com/living/index.ssf/2012/11/more_than_2_decades_ago_the_re.html]&lt;/ref&gt; A key point was that Hollywood in Alabama was the first incorporated Hollywood in the nation, whereas the one in California did not incorporate until 1903, 6 years after Alabama's. In addition, it merged with [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in 1910 and was no longer identified as a separate city.

==Geography==
Hollywood is located at {{Coord|34|43|1|N|85|57|56|W|type:city}} (34.716960, -85.965689).&lt;ref name="GR1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|8.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|8.9|sqmi|km2}} is land and 0.11% is water.
