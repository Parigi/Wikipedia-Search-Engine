''This article covers the [[Spanish Civil War]] in the period from the start of 1938 to the end of 1939. For a historical context, see [[Timeline of Spanish history#20th century]].''

By this period, the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] had already become dominant, yet the outcome of the war was still not certain.  This was to progressively change as the Nationalist forces notched up several victories.

The [[Battle of Teruel]] was an important confrontation between Nationalists and Republicans. The city belonged to the Republicans at the beginning of the battle, but the Nationalists conquered it in January. The Republican government launched an offensive and recovered the city, however the Nationalists finally conquered it for good by February 22. On April 14, the Nationalists broke through to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] during the [[Aragon Offensive]], cutting the government-held portion of Spain in two. The government tried to sue for peace in May, but [[Francisco Franco]] demanded [[unconditional surrender]], and the war raged on.  The Nationalist army pressed southward from [[Teruel]] and along the coast toward the capital of the Republic at [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] but were halted in heavy fighting along the fortified [[XYZ Line]].

The government now launched an all-out campaign to distract the Nationalists from their attack on Valencia and to reconnect their territory in the [[Battle of the Ebro]], beginning on July 24 and lasting until November 26. Although the campaign was militarily successful at first, it was fatally undermined by the Franco-British appeasement of [[Adolf Hitler]] in the [[Munich Agreement]]. The concession of [[Czechoslovakia]] destroyed the last vestiges of Republican morale by ending all hope of an anti-Francoist alliance with the great powers. The Republicans were eventually defeated and withdrew in November 1938, another significant step towards the Nationalist's final victory.

The retreat from the Ebro all but determined the final outcome of the war. Eight days before the new year, Franco struck back by throwing massive forces into an invasion of [[Catalonia]].

The Nationalists conquered Catalonia in a whirlwind [[Catalonia Offensive|campaign]] during the first two months of 1939. [[Tarragona]] fell on January 14, followed by [[Barcelona]] on January 26 and [[Girona]] on February 5. Five days after the fall of Girona, the last resistance in Catalonia was broken.

On February 27, the governments of the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] recognized [[Francoist Spain]].

Only [[Madrid]] and a few other strongholds remained for the government forces. On March 28, with the help of pro-Nationalist forces inside the city (the "[[fifth column]]" General Mola had mentioned in [[propaganda]] broadcasts in 1936), Madrid fell to the Nationalists. The next day, Valencia, which had held out under the guns of the Nationalists for close to two years, also surrendered. Victory was proclaimed on April 1, when the last of the Republican forces surrendered.

After the end of the war, there were severe reprisals against the Nationalist's former enemies on the left, when thousands of Republicans were imprisoned and between 10,000 and 28,000 executed. Many other Republicans fled abroad, especially to France and Mexico.
