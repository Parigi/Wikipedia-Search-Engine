'''''Spirit''''', also known as '''MER-A''' ('''Mars Exploration Rover – A''') or '''MER-2''', is a [[Mars Rover|robotic rover on Mars]], active from 2004 to 2010.&lt;ref name="NASA-Spirit" /&gt;  It was one of two [[rover (space exploration)|rovers]] of [[NASA]]'s [[Mars Exploration Rover]] Mission. It landed successfully within the impact crater [[Gusev (Martian crater)|Gusev]] on [[Mars]] at 04:35 [[Ground UTC]] on January 4, 2004, three weeks before its twin, ''[[Opportunity (rover)|Opportunity]]'' (MER-B), which landed on the other side of the planet. Its name was chosen through a [[Sofi Collis|NASA-sponsored student essay competition]]. The rover became stuck in a "sand trap" in late 2009 at an angle that hampered recharging of its batteries; its last communication with Earth was sent on March 22, 2010.

The rover completed its planned 90-[[Martian day|sol]] mission. Aided by [[cleaning event]]s that resulted in more energy from its solar panels, ''Spirit'' went on to function effectively over twenty times longer than NASA planners expected. ''Spirit'' also logged {{convert|7.73|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} of driving instead of the planned {{convert|600|m|mi|1|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20110525a.html|title=NASA Spirit Rover Completes Mission on Mars|publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]|date=May 25, 2011|accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing more extensive geological analysis of Martian rocks and planetary surface features. Initial scientific results from the first phase of the mission (the 90-[[Timekeeping on Mars|sol]] prime mission) were published in a special issue of the journal [[Science (journal)|''Science'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Special Issue: Spirit at Gusev Crater |journal=Science |volume=305 |issue=5685 |pages=737–900 |date=August 6, 2004 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/305/5685.toc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1, 2009 (5 years, 3 months, 27 Earth days after landing; 21.6 times the planned mission duration), ''Spirit'' became stuck in soft sand.&lt;ref name="NYT20090525"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/26/science/26obmars.html |title=Crater was Shaped by Wind and Water, Mars Rover Data Shows |author=Henry Fountain |work=New York Times |date=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not the first of the mission's "embedding events" and for the following eight months  [[NASA]] carefully analyzed the situation, running Earth-based theoretical and practical simulations, and finally programming the rover to make [[Vehicle extrication|extrication]] drives in an attempt to free itself. These efforts continued until January 26, 2010 when NASA officials announced that the rover was likely irrecoverably obstructed by its location in soft sand,&lt;ref name="BBC_Stuck"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8481798.stm|title=Nasa accepts Spirit Mars rover 'stuck for good'|date=January 26, 2010|work=BBC News|author=Amos, Jonathan|quote=The US space agency (Nasa) has conceded defeat in its battle to free the Spirit rover from its Martian sand trap.

Mars Exploration Rover project for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington.

==Mission overview==
[[File:LandingSiteR1.jpg|thumb|left|''Spirit'' landing site, as imaged by [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter|MRO]] (December 4, 2006); click image to enlarge]]
[[File:MOLA spirit.jpg|thumb|right|An overall view of MER-A ''Spirit'' landing site (denoted with a star)]]
The primary surface mission for ''Spirit'' was planned to last at least 90 [[Timekeeping on Mars|sols]]. The mission received several extensions and lasted about 2,208 sols. On August 11, 2007, ''Spirit'' obtained the second longest operational duration on the surface of Mars for a lander or rover at 1282 Sols, one sol longer than the [[Viking 2]] lander. Viking 2 was powered by a nuclear cell whereas ''Spirit'' is powered by solar arrays. Until ''Opportunity'' overtook it on May 19, 2010, the Mars probe with longest operational period was [[Viking 1]] that lasted for 2245 Sols on the surface of Mars. On March 22, 2010, ''Spirit'' sent its last communication, thus falling just over a month short of surpassing Viking 1's operational record. An archive of weekly updates on the rover's status can be found at the ''Spirit'' Update Archive.&lt;ref name="SpiritUpdateArchive" /&gt;

''Spirit's'' total odometry as of March 22, 2010 (sol 2210) is {{convert|7730.50|m|mi|2|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll.html |title=Spirit Updates |accessdate=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
[[File:Lancement Spirit fusee Delta IIs 10062003.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Delta II lifting off with MER-A on June 10, 2003]]
The scientific objectives of the Mars Exploration Rover mission were to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/science/objectives.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: Science|website=marsrovers.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Search for and characterize a variety of rocks and soils that hold clues to past water activity. In particular, samples sought will include those that have minerals deposited by water-related processes such as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[Water vapor|evaporation]], [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary cementation]] or [[hydrothermal activity]].
* Determine the distribution and composition of minerals, rocks, and soils surrounding the landing sites.
* Determine what [[Geology of Mars|geologic processes]] have shaped the local terrain and influenced the chemistry. Such processes could include water or wind erosion, sedimentation, hydrothermal mechanisms, volcanism, and cratering.
* Perform calibration and validation of surface observations made by [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] instruments. This will help determine the accuracy and effectiveness of various instruments that survey [[Geology of Mars|Martian geology]] from orbit.
* Search for iron-containing minerals, identify and quantify relative amounts of specific mineral types that contain water or were formed in water, such as iron-bearing carbonates.
* Characterize the [[mineralogy]] and textures of rocks and soils and determine the processes that created them.
* Search for geological clues to the [[Environmental science|environmental conditions]] that existed when liquid water was present.
* Assess whether those environments were conducive to life.

NASA sought evidence of life on Mars, beginning with the question of whether the Martian environment was ever suitable for life. Life forms known to science require water, so the history of [[water on Mars]] is a critical piece of knowledge. Although the Mars Exploration Rovers did not have the ability to detect life directly, they offered very important information on the habitability of the environment during the planet's history.

{{see also|Comparison of embedded computer systems on board the Mars rovers}}

''Spirit'' (and its twin, ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]'') are six-wheeled, [[solar panel|solar-powered]] robots standing {{convert|1.5|m|ft|sp=us}} high, {{convert|2.3|m|ft|sp=us}} wide and {{convert|1.6|m|ft|sp=us}} long and weighing {{convert|180|kg|lb}}. Six wheels on a [[rocker-bogie]] system enable mobility over rough terrain. Each wheel has its own motor. The vehicle is steered at front and rear and is designed to operate safely at tilts of up to 30 degrees. Maximum speed is {{convert|5|cm/s|in/s|sp=us}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft_rover_wheels.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: The Mission|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|0.18|km/h|mph|sp=us}}, although average speed is about {{convert|1|cm/s|in/s|sp=us}}. Both ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' have pieces of the fallen [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]'s metal on them that were "turned into shields to protect cables on the drilling mechanisms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/07/science/07mars.html?pagewanted=2 |title=Martian Robots, Taking Orders From a Manhattan Walk-Up |work=The New York Times |date=November 7, 2004 |accessdate=April 9, 2009 | first=Kenneth | last=Chang}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Steve|last=Squyres|title=Roving Mars: Spirit, Opportunity, and the Exploration of the Red Planet|publisher=Hyperion Press|year=2005|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GQBRAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Roving+Mars%22&amp;q=%22World+Trade+Center%22#search|pages=113–117 | isbn=978-1-4013-0149-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar arrays generate about 140 watts for up to four hours per Martian day (sol) while rechargeable [[lithium ion batteries]] store energy for use at night. ''Spirit's'' onboard computer uses a 20&amp;nbsp;MHz [[IBM RAD6000|RAD6000]] CPU with 128 MB of DRAM, 3 MB of EEPROM, and 256 MB of flash memory. The rover's [[operating temperature]] ranges from {{convert|-40|to|+40|C|F}} and [[radioisotope heater unit]]s provide a base level of heating, assisted by electrical heaters when necessary. A gold film and a layer of silica [[aerogel]] provide insulation.

Communications depends on an omnidirectional low-gain antenna communicating at a low data rate and a steerable high-gain antenna, both in direct contact with Earth. A low gain antenna is also used to relay data to spacecraft orbiting Mars.

===Science payload===

The science instruments include:

* [[Pancam|Panoramic Camera (Pancam)]] – examines the texture, color, mineralogy, and structure of the local terrain.
* [[Navcam|Navigation Camera (Navcam)]] – monochrome with a higher field of view but lower resolution, for navigation and driving.
* [[Mini-TES|Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES)]] – identifies promising rocks and soils for closer examination, and determines the processes that formed them.
* [[Hazcam]]s, two B&amp;W cameras with 120 degree field of view, that provide additional data about the rover's surroundings.

The rover arm holds the following instruments:

* [[Mössbauer spectrometer]] (MB) [[MIMOS II]] – used for close-up investigations of the mineralogy of iron-bearing rocks and soils.
* [[Alpha particle X-ray spectrometer]] (APXS) – close-up analysis of the abundances of elements that make up rocks and soils.
* Magnets – for collecting magnetic dust particles.
* Microscopic Imager (MI) – obtains close-up, high-resolution images of rocks and soils.
* [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] (RAT) – exposes fresh material for examination by instruments on board.

== Mission timeline ==

=== 2004 ===
The ''Spirit'' Mars rover and lander arrived successfully on the surface of Mars on 04:35 [[Ground UTC]] on January 4, 2004. This was the start of its 90-sol mission, but solar cell cleaning events would mean it was the start of a much longer mission, lasting until 2010.

==== Landing site: ''Columbia'' Memorial Station ====
[[Image:Columbia Hills from MER-A landing site PIA05200 br2.jpg|thumb|right|Annotated Columbia Hills panorama from the ''Spirit'' landing site]]
''Spirit'' was targeted to a site that appears to have been affected by liquid water in the past, the crater [[Gusev (Martian crater)|Gusev]], a possible former lake in a giant [[impact crater]] about {{convert|10|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} from the center of the target ellipse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marsoweb.nas.nasa.gov/landingsites/mer2003/topsites/final/Gusev/|title=Gusev Crater: LandingSites|website=marsoweb.nas.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; at {{Coord|14.5718|S|175.4785|E|globe:mars_type:landmark}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceflightnow.com/mars/mera/040113exploration.html Spaceflightnow.com], Destination Mars, Rover headed toward hilly vista for martian exploration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After the airbag-protected landing craft settled onto the surface, the rover rolled out to take panoramic images. These give scientists the information they need to select promising geological targets and drive to those locations to perform on-site scientific investigations. The panoramic image below shows a slightly rolling surface, littered with small rocks, with hills on the horizon up to {{convert|3|km|mi|sp=us}} away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap040114.html|title=APOD: 2004 January 14 – A Mars Panorama from the Spirit Rover|website=antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MER team named the landing site "''Columbia'' Memorial Station," in honor of the seven [[astronauts]] killed in the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]].

"[[Sleepy Hollow (Mars)|Sleepy Hollow]]," a shallow depression in the Mars ground at the right side of the above picture, was targeted as an early destination when the rover drove off its lander platform. NASA scientists were very interested in this crater. It is {{convert|9|m|ft|sp=us}} across and about {{convert|12|m|ft|sp=us}} north of the lander.

To the right is the first color image derived from images taken by the panoramic camera on the Mars Exploration Rover ''Spirit''. It was the highest resolution image taken on the surface of another planet. According to the camera designer Jim Bell of [[Cornell University]], the panoramic mosaic consists of four pancam images high by three wide. The picture shown originally had a full size of 4,000 by 3,000 [[pixels]]. However, a complete pancam panorama is even 8 times larger than that, and could be taken in stereo (i.e., two complete pictures, making the resolution twice as large again.) The colors are fairly accurate. (For a technical explanation, see [http://areo.info/mer/ colors outside the range of the human eye].)

The MER pancams are black-and-white instruments. Thirteen rotating filter wheels produce multiple images of the same scene at different wavelengths. Once received on Earth, these images can be combined to produce color images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lyle.org/~markoff/methods.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424065044/http://www.lyle.org/~markoff/methods.html|url-status=dead|title=MER color imagery, methods|archivedate=April 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|21}} flash memory management anomaly ====
On January 21, 2004 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|21}}), ''Spirit'' abruptly ceased communicating with mission control. The next day the rover radioed a 7.8 bit/s beep, confirming that it had received a transmission from Earth but indicating that the craft believed it was in a fault mode. Commands would only be responded to intermittently. This was described as a very serious anomaly, but potentially recoverable if it were a software or memory corruption issue rather than a serious hardware failure. ''Spirit'' was commanded to transmit engineering data, and on January 23 sent several short low-bitrate messages before finally transmitting 73 megabits via [[X band]] to ''[[Mars Odyssey]]''. The readings from the engineering data suggested that the rover was not staying in sleep mode. As such, it was wasting its battery energy and overheating – risk factors that could potentially destroy the rover if not fixed soon. On sol 20, the command team sent it the command SHUTDWN_DMT_TIL ("Shutdown Dammit Until") to try to cause it to suspend itself until a given time. It seemingly ignored the command.

The leading theory at the time was that the rover was stuck in a "reboot loop". The rover was programmed to reboot if there was a fault aboard. However, if there was a fault that occurred during reboot, it would continue to reboot forever. The fact that the problem persisted through reboot suggested that the error was not in RAM, but in either the [[flash memory]], the [[EEPROM]], or a hardware fault. The last case would likely doom the rover. Anticipating the potential for errors in the flash memory and EEPROM, the designers had made it so that the rover could be booted without ever touching the flash memory. The radio itself could decode a limited command set – enough to tell the rover to reboot without using flash. Without access to flash memory the reboot cycle was broken.

On January 24, 2004 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|24}}) the rover repair team announced that the problem was with ''Spirit'''s flash memory and the software that wrote to it. The flash hardware was believed to be working correctly but the file management module in the software was "not robust enough" for the operations the ''Spirit'' was engaged in when the problem occurred, indicating that the problem was caused by a software bug as opposed to faulty hardware. NASA engineers finally came to the conclusion that there were too many files on the file system, which was a relatively minor problem. Most of these files contained unneeded in-flight data. After realizing what the problem was, the engineers deleted some files, and eventually reformatted the entire flash memory system. On February 6 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|02|06}}), the rover was restored to its original working condition, and science activities resumed.&lt;ref name="planetary"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719212649/http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000702/ Planetary Blog].&lt;/ref&gt;

==== First intentional grinding of a rock on Mars ====
[[File:Rat post grind.jpg|thumb|right|Digital camera (the [[Pancam]]) image of a Mars rock (called [[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]) taken after a [[Rock Abrasion Tool|RAT]] grind (the rock grinding tool)]]
For the first intentional grinding of a rock on Mars, the ''Spirit'' team chose a rock called "[[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]". To make the drive there, the rover turned 40 degrees in short arcs totaling {{convert|95|cm}}. It then turned in place to face the target rock and drove four short moves straightforward totaling {{cvt|1.9|m}}. Adirondack was chosen over another rock called "Sashimi", which was closer to the rover, as Adirondack's surface was smoother, making it more suitable for the [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] (aka "RAT").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Webster |first=Guy |date=January 19, 2004 |title=Spirit Drives to a Rock Called 'Adirondack' for Close Inspection |url=https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/newsroom/pressreleases/20040119a.html |publisher=NASA |access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Spirit'' made a small depression in the rock, {{convert|45.5|mm}} in diameter and {{convert|2.65|mm}} deep. Examination of the freshly exposed interior with the rover's microscopic imager and other instruments confirmed that the rock is volcanic basalt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Webster |first=Guy |date=February 9, 2004 |title=Mars Rover Pictures Raise 'Blueberry Muffin' Questions |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/newsroom/pressreleases/20040209a.html |publisher=NASA |access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Humphrey rock ====
On March 5, 2004, NASA announced that ''Spirit'' had found hints of water history on Mars in a rock dubbed "Humphrey". Raymond Arvidson, the McDonnell University Professor and chair of Earth and Planetary Sciences at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], reported during a NASA press conference: "If we found this rock on Earth, we would say it is a volcanic rock that had a little fluid moving through it." In contrast to the rocks found by the twin rover ''Opportunity'', this one was formed from [[magma]] and then acquired bright material in small crevices, which look like crystallized minerals. If this interpretation holds true, the minerals were most likely dissolved in water, which was either carried inside the rock or interacted with it at a later stage, after it formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20040305a.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover|last=mars.nasa.gov|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bonneville crater ====
On sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|03|11}} March 11, 2004, ''Spirit'' reached [[Bonneville (crater)|Bonneville crater]] after a {{convert|400|yd|m|adj=on|sp=us}} journey.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} This crater is about {{convert|200|m|yd|sp=us}} across with a floor about {{convert|10|m|yd|sp=us}} [[Crater depth|below]] the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Surfical geology of the Spirit rover traverse in Gusev Crater: dry and desiccating since the Hesperian |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/earlymars2004/pdf/8055.pdf |conference=Second Conference on Early Mars (2004) |accessdate=January 26, 2009 |author=Golombek|page=1 |quote=The rim is ~{{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} high and although the crater is shallow (~{{convert|10|m|ft|sp=us}} deep)|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; JPL decided that it would be a bad idea to send the rover down into the crater, as they saw no targets of interest inside. ''Spirit'' drove along the southern rim and continued to the southwest towards the Columbia Hills.
{{wide image|PIA05591 Spirit's Destination (panorama).jpg|800px|Bonneville Crater}}

''Spirit'' reached Missoula crater on sol 105. The crater is roughly {{convert|100|yd|m|sp=us}} across and {{convert|20|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. Missoula crater was not considered a high priority target due to the older rocks it contained. The rover skirted the northern rim, and continued to the southeast.
It then reached Lahontan crater on sol 118, and drove along the rim until sol 120. Lahontan is about {{convert|60|yd|m|sp=us}} across and about {{convert|10|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. A long, snaking sand dune stretches away from its southwestern side, and ''Spirit'' went around it, because loose sand dunes present an unknown risk to the ability of the rover wheels to get traction.

==== Columbia Hills ====
''Spirit'' drove from Bonneville crater in a direct line to the Columbia Hills. The route was only directly controlled by the engineers when the terrain was difficult to navigate; otherwise, the rover drove in an autonomous mode. On sol 159, ''Spirit'' reached the first of many targets at the base of the [[Columbia Hills (Mars)|Columbia Hills]] called West Spur. Hank's Hollow was studied for 23 sols. Within Hank's Hollow was the strange-looking rock dubbed "[[Pot of Gold (Mars)|Pot of Gold]]". Analysing this rock was difficult for Spirit, because it lay in a slippery area. After a detailed analysis with the AXPS-and the Mößbauer instrument it was detected that it contains hematite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2004-161 | title = Mars Rovers Surprises Continue | work = JPL website | accessdate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of rock can  be built in connection with water.

As the produced energy from the solar panels was lowering due to the setting sun and dust the Deep Sleep Mode was introduced. In this mode the rover was shut down completely during the night in order to save energy, even if the instruments would fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2004.html#sol171|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The route was selected so that the rover's panels were tilted as much as possible towards the winter sun.

From here, ''Spirit'' took a northerly path along the base of the hill towards the target Wooly Patch, which was studied from sol 192 to sol 199. By sol 203, ''Spirit'' had driven southward up the hill and arrived at the rock dubbed "Clovis". Clovis was ground and analyzed from sol 210 to sol 225. Following Clovis came the targets of Ebenezer (Sols 226–235), Tetl (sol 270), Uchben and Palinque (Sols 281–295), and Lutefisk (Sols 296–303). From Sols 239 to 262, ''Spirit'' powered down for [[solar conjunction]], when communications with the Earth are blocked. Slowly, ''Spirit'' made its way around the summit of Husband Hill, and at sol 344 was ready to climb over the newly designated "Cumberland Ridge" and into "[[Larry's Lookout]]" and "Tennessee Valley". ''Spirit'' also did some communication tests with the ESA orbiter ''[[Mars Express]]'' though most of the communication was usually done with the NASA orbiters ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]''.

=== 2005 ===

==== Driving up to Husband Hill ====
''Spirit'' had now been on Mars for one Earth year and was driving slowly uphill towards the top of Husband Hill. This was difficult because there were many rocky obstacles and sandy parts. This lead frequently to a slippage and the route could not be driven as planned. In February ''Spirit'''s computer received a software update in order to drive more autonomously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2005.html#sol416|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; On sol 371, ''Spirit'' arrived at a rock named "Peace" near the top of Cumberland Ridge. ''Spirit'' ground ''Peace'' with the RAT on sol 373. By sol 390 (mid-February 2005), ''Spirit'' was advancing towards "Larry's Lookout", by driving up the hill in reverse. The scientists at this time were trying to conserve as much energy as possible for the climb.

''Spirit'' also investigated some targets along the way, including the soil target, "Paso Robles", which contained the highest amount of salt found on the red planet. The soil also contained a high amount of [[phosphorus]] in its composition, however not nearly as high as another rock sampled by ''Spirit'', "Wishstone". Squyres said of the discovery, "We're still trying to work out what this means, but clearly, with this much salt around, water had a hand here".

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Dust devils ====
On March 9, 2005 (probably during the Martian night), the rover's solar panel efficiency jumped from the original ~60%  to 93%, followed on March 10, by the sighting of [[dust devils]]. NASA scientists speculate a dust devil must have swept the solar panels clean, possibly significantly extending the duration of the mission. This also marks the first time dust devils had been spotted by ''Spirit'' or ''Opportunity'', and is easily one of the top highlights of the mission to date. Dust devils had previously only been photographed by the ''[[Mars Pathfinder|Pathfinder]]'' probe.

Mission members monitoring ''Spirit'' on Mars reported on March 12, 2005 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2005|03|12}}), that a lucky encounter with a dust devil had cleaned the robot's solar panels. Energy levels dramatically increased and daily science work was anticipated to be expanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = David | first = Leonard | date = March 12, 2005 | url = http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/spirit_dust_050312.html | title = Spirit Gets A Dust Devil Once-Over | publisher = Space.com | accessdate =December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Husband Hill summit ====
As of August ''Spirit'' was only {{convert|100|m}} away from the top. Here it was found that Husband Hill has two summits, with one a little higher than the other. On August 21 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2005|08|24}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rover Update: 2005: All |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/mission/rover-status/spirit/2005/all/#sol579 |website=mars.nasa.gov |accessdate=23 April 2020 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ''Spirit'' reached the real summit of Husband Hill. The rover was the first spacecraft to climb atop a mountain on another planet. The whole distance driven totaled 4971 meters.
The summit itself was flat. ''Spirit'' took a 360 degree panorama in real color, which included the whole Gusev crater. At night the rover observed the moons [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] in order to determine their orbits better.&lt;ref name="nasa_2010_189"&gt;{{cite web

From the peak ''Spirit'' spotted a striking formation, which was dubbed "Home Plate". This was an interesting target, but ''Spirit'' would be driven later to the McCool Hill to tilt its solar panels towards the sun in the coming winter. At the end of October the rover was driven downhill and to Home Plate. On the way down ''Spirit'' reached the rock formation named "Comanche" on sol 690. Scientists used data from all three spectrometers to find out that about one-fourth of the composition of Comanche is magnesium iron carbonate. That concentration is 10 times higher than for any previously identified carbonate in a Martian rock. Carbonates originate in wet, near-neutral conditions but dissolve in acid. The find at Comanche is the first unambiguous evidence from the Mars Exploration Mission rovers for a past Martian environment that may have been more favorable to life than the wet but acidic conditions indicated by the rovers' earlier finds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/multimedia/gallery/comanche-no-label.html|title=NASA – Carbonate-Containing Martian Rocks (False Color)|website=www.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2006 ===

==== Driving to McCool Hill ====
In 2006 ''Spirit'' drove towards an area dubbed Home Plate, and reached it in February. For events in 2006 by NASA see [http://marsrover.nasa.gov/mission/status_spirit_2006.html NASA Spirit Archive 2006]

''Spirit's'' next stop was originally planned to be the north face of [[McCool Hill]], where ''Spirit'' would receive adequate sunlight during the Martian winter. On March 16, 2006 JPL announced that ''Spirit's'' troublesome front wheel had stopped working altogether. Despite this, ''Spirit'' was still making progress toward McCool Hill because the control team programmed the rover to drive toward McCool Hill backwards, dragging its broken wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll.html#sol778|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In late March, ''Spirit'' encountered loose soil that was impeding its progress toward McCool Hill. A decision was made to terminate attempts to reach McCool Hill and instead park on a nearby ridge named Low Ridge Haven.

''Spirit'' arrived at the north west corner of [[Home Plate (Mars)|Home Plate]], a raised and layered outcrop on sol 744 (February 2006) after an effort to maximize driving. Scientific observations were conducted with ''Spirit's'' robotic arm.

==== Low Ridge Haven ====
[[File:PIA08576-Spirit Rover-Possible Meteorites at Low Ridge.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Possible meteorites found at Low Ridge]]
Reaching the ridge on April 9, 2006 and parking on the ridge with an 11° incline to the north, ''Spirit'' spent the next eight months on the ridge, spending that time undertaking observations of changes in the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/missions/mer/mer-20060412.html|title=NASA – NASA Mars Rovers Head for New Sites After Studying Layers|website=www.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No drives were attempted because of the low energy levels the rover was experiencing during the Martian winter. The rover made its first drive, a short turn to position targets of interest within reach of the robotic arm, in early November 2006, following the shortest days of winter and solar conjunction when communications with Earth were severely limited.

While at Low Ridge, ''Spirit'' imaged two rocks of similar chemical nature to that of ''Opportunity'''s [[Heat Shield Rock]], a [[meteorite]] on the surface of Mars. Named "Zhong Shan" for [[Sun Yat-sen]] and "Allan Hills" for the [[Allan Hills|location]] in [[Antarctica]] where several Martian meteorites have been found, they stood out against the background rocks that were darker. Further spectrographic testing is being done to determine the exact composition of these rocks, which may turn out to also be meteorites.

=== 2007 ===

==== Software upgrade ====
On January 4, 2007 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2007|01|04}}), both rovers received new flight software to the onboard computers. The update was received just in time for the third anniversary of their landing. The new systems let the rovers decide whether or not to transmit an image, and whether or not to extend their arms to examine rocks, which would save much time for scientists as they would not have to sift through hundreds of images to find the one they want, or examine the surroundings to decide to extend the arms and examine the rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/01/04/tech-mars.html | work=CBC News | title=Old rovers learn new tricks | date=January 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Silica Valley====
[[File:Spirit Mars Silica April 20 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Rover exposes silica-rich dust]]
''Spirit'''s dead wheel turned out to have a silver lining. As it was traveling in March 2007, pulling the dead wheel behind, the wheel scraped off the upper layer of the Martian soil, uncovering a patch of ground that scientists say shows evidence of a past environment that would have been perfect for microbial life. It is similar to areas on Earth where water or steam from hot springs came into contact with volcanic rocks. On Earth, these are locations that tend to teem with bacteria, said rover chief scientist [[Steve Squyres]]. "We're really excited about this," he told a meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The area is extremely rich in [[Silicon dioxide|silica]]–the main ingredient of window glass. The researchers have now concluded that the bright material must have been produced in one of two ways. One: hot-spring deposits produced when water dissolved silica at one location and then carried it to another (i.e. a geyser). Two: acidic steam rising through cracks in rocks  stripped them of their mineral components, leaving silica behind. "The important thing is that whether it is one hypothesis or the other, the implications for the former habitability of Mars are pretty much the same," Squyres explained to BBC News. Hot water provides an environment in which [[microbe]]s can thrive and the precipitation of that silica entombs and preserves them. Squyres added, "You can go to [[hot spring]]s and you can go to [[fumarole]]s and at either place on Earth it is teeming with life – [[Microorganism|microbial life]]."&lt;ref name="Amos"&gt;{{cite news  | last = Amos  | first = Jonathan    | title = Mars robot unearths microbe clue   | work = NASA says its robot rover Spirit has made one of its most significant discoveries on the surface of Mars. |publisher=BBC News  | date = December 11, 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7137793.stm  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="20071210a"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Bertster  | first =  Guy   | title = Mars Rover Investigates Signs of Steamy Martian Past  | work = Press Release  | publisher = Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California  | date = December 10, 2007  | url = http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20071210a.html  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global dust storm and Home Plate ====
During 2007 ''Spirit'' spent several months near the base of the Home Plate plateau. On sol 1306 ''Spirit'' climbed onto the eastern edge of the plateau. In September and October it examined rocks and soils at several locations on the southern half of the plateau. On November 6, ''Spirit'' had reached the western edge of Home Plate, and started taking pictures for a panoramic overview of the western valley, with Grissom Hill and Husband Hill visible. The panorama image was published on NASA's website on January 3, 2008 to little attention, until January 23, when an independent website published a magnified detail of the image that showed a rock feature a few centimeters high resembling a humanoid figure seen from the side with its right arm partially raised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001305/ Planetary.org] Emily Lakdawalla, ''Teeny little Bigfoot on Mars'', January 23, 2008 | 12:41 PST | 20:41 UTC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD |date=January 29, 2008 |title=Spirit's West Valley Panorama image |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mars Spirit rover's solar panels covered with Dust - October 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Circular projection showing ''Spirit'''s solar panels covered in dust – October 2007]]
Towards the end of June 2007, a series of dust storms began clouding the Martian atmosphere with dust. The storms intensified and by July 20, both ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' were facing the real possibility of system failure due to lack of energy. NASA released a statement to the press that said (in part) "We're rooting for our rovers to survive these storms, but they were never designed for conditions this intense".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press| url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2007-080| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=NASA Mars Rovers Braving Severe Dust Storms| date=July 27, 2007| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key problem caused by the dust storms was a dramatic reduction in solar energy caused by there being so much dust in the atmosphere that it was blocking 99 percent of direct sunlight to ''Opportunity'', and slightly more to ''Spirit''.

Normally the solar arrays on the rovers are able to generate up to {{Convert|700|Wh}} of energy per [[Martian day]]. After the storms, the amount of energy generated was greatly reduced to {{Convert|128|Wh}}. If the rovers generate less than {{Convert|150|Wh}} per day they must start draining their batteries to run survival heaters. If the batteries run dry, key electrical elements are likely to fail due to the intense cold. Both rovers were put into the lowest-power setting in order to wait out the storms. In early August the storms began to clear slightly, allowing the rovers to successfully charge their batteries. They were kept in hibernation in order to wait out the remainder of the storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press| url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20070807a.html| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=Martian Skies Brighten Slightly| date=August 7, 2007| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2008 ===

==== Hibernating ====
The main concern was the energy level for ''Spirit''. To increase the amount of light hitting the solar panels, the rover was parked in the northern part of Home Plate on as steep a slope as possible. It was expected that the level of dust cover on the solar panels would increase by 70 percent and that a slope of 30 degrees would be necessary to survive the winter. In February, a tilt of 29.9 degrees was achieved. Extra energy was available at times, and a high definition panorama named ''Bonestell'' was produced. At other times when there was only enough solar energy to recharge the batteries, communication with Earth was minimized and all unnecessary instruments were switched off. At winter solstice the energy production declined to 235 watt hours per sol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2008.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Winter dust storm ====

==== Increased energy ====
On February 6, 2009, a beneficial wind blew off some of the dust accumulated on the panels. This led to an increase in energy output to {{Convert|240|Wh}} per day. NASA officials stated that this increase in energy was to be used predominantly for driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=February 17, 2009|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20090212a.html |title=Spirit Gets Energy Boost from Cleaner Solar Panels |publisher=NASA/JPL }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sand trap ====
[[File:Spirit Sandbox Setup.jpg|thumb|right|Engineers attempt to replicate conditions in the laboratory of ''Spirit'''s entrapment on a rock and in fluffy material churned by the rover's left-front wheel.]]

On May 1, 2009 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2009|05|01}}), the rover became stuck in soft sand, the machine resting upon a cache of [[iron(III) sulfate]] ([[jarosite]]) hidden under a veneer of normal-looking soil. Iron sulfate has very little cohesion, making it difficult for the rover's wheels to gain traction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

JPL team members simulated the situation by means of a rover mock-up and computer models in an attempt to get the rover back on track. To reproduce the same [[soil mechanics|soil mechanical]] conditions on Earth as those prevailing on Mars under low [[Gravitation|gravity]] and under very weak atmospheric pressure, tests with a lighter version of a mock-up of ''Spirit'' were conducted at JPL in a special sandbox to attempt to simulate the [[cohesion (geology)|cohesion behavior]] of [[Consolidation (soil)|poorly consolidated soils]] under low gravity.&lt;ref name="Free_Spirit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/freespirit/|title=Free Spirit - jpl.nasa.gov|website=www.jpl.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sphere.com/nation/article/to-rescue-rover-on-mars-nasa-practices-in-pasadena-sandbox/19273469 |title=A How a Sandbox Could Save Mars Rover |publisher=sphere.com |date=December 10, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117141008/http://www.sphere.com/nation/article/to-rescue-rover-on-mars-nasa-practices-in-pasadena-sandbox/19273469 |archivedate=January 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary extrication drives began on November 17, 2009.&lt;ref name="SpiritUpdateArchive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spirit.html |title=Spirit Update Archive |publisher=NASA/JPL |accessdate=May 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 17, 2009 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2009|12|17}}), the right-front wheel suddenly began to operate normally for the first three out of four rotations attempts. It was unknown what effect it would have on freeing the rover if the wheel became fully operational again. The right rear wheel had also stalled on November 28 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2009|11|28}}) and remained inoperable for the remainder of the mission. This left the rover with only four fully operational wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Right-Front Wheel Rotations |url=http://marsrover.nasa.gov/spotlight/20091217a.html |date=December 17, 2009 |work=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the team could not gain movement and adjust the tilt of the solar panels, or gain a beneficial wind to clean the panels, the rover would only be able to sustain operations until May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=December 31, 2009 |title=NASA's Mars Rover has Uncertain Future as Sixth Anniversary Nears |url=http://marsrover.nasa.gov/spotlight/20091231a.html |accessdate=January 1, 2010 |work=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mars winter at Troy ====
{{wideimage|Free Spirit.jpg|1100px|Color panorama from "Troy" embedding location}}

On January 26, 2010 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2010|01|26}}), after several months attempting to free the rover, NASA decided to redefine the mobile robot mission by calling it a stationary research platform. Efforts were directed in preparing a more suitable orientation of the platform in relation to the Sun in an attempt to allow a more efficient recharge of the platform's batteries. This was needed to keep some systems operational during the Martian winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Now A Stationary Research Platform, NASA's Mars Rover Spirit Starts a New Chapter in Red Planet Scientific Studies |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/freespirit/ |date=January 26, 2010 |work=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 30, 2010, Spirit skipped a planned communication session and as anticipated from recent power-supply projections, had probably entered a low-power hibernation mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Spirit May Have Begun Months-Long Hibernation |url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20100331a.html |date=March 31, 2010 |work=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HomePlate.png|thumb|right|''Spirit'''s concluding journey around Homeplate and ending location.]]
The last communication with the rover was March 22, 2010 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2010|03|22}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll.html#sol2533 |title=Spirit status |publisher=NASA |accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a strong possibility the rover's batteries lost so much energy at some point that the mission clock stopped. In previous winters the rover was able to park on a Sun-facing slope and keep its internal temperature above {{convert|−40|C|F}}, but since the rover was stuck on flat ground it is estimated that its internal temperature dropped to {{convert|−55|C|F}}. If ''Spirit'' had survived these conditions and there had been a cleaning event, there was a possibility that with the southern summer solstice in March 2011, solar energy would increase to a level that would wake up the rover.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.S. Rayl [http://www.planetary.org/news/2010/0731_Mars_Exploration_Rovers_Update_Spirit.html Spirit Sleeps Soundlessly, Opportunity Turns a Corner] ''[[Planetary Society]]'' July 31, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Communication attempts ====
''Spirit'' remains silent at its location, called "Troy," on the west side of Home Plate. {{as of|2018}}, there has been no communication with the rover since March 22, 2010 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2010|03|22}}).&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Reisert |first1=Sarah  |title=Life on Mars |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=1 |pages=42–45 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/life-on-mars|accessdate=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is likely that ''Spirit'' experienced a low-power fault and had turned off all sub-systems, including communication, and gone into a deep sleep, trying to recharge its batteries. It is also possible that the rover had experienced a mission clock fault. If that had happened, the rover would have lost track of time and tried to remain asleep until enough sunlight struck the solar arrays to wake it. This state is called "Solar Groovy." If the rover woke up from a mission clock fault, it would only listen. Starting on July 26, 2010 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2010|07|26}}), a new procedure to address the possible mission clock fault was implemented.

Each sol, the Deep Space Network mission controllers sent a set of X-band "Sweep &amp; Beep" commands. If the rover had experienced a mission clock fault and then had been awoken during the day, it would have listened during brief, 20-minute intervals during each hour awake. Due to the possible clock fault, the timing of these 20-minute listening intervals was not known, so multiple "Sweep &amp; Beep" commands were sent. If the rover heard one of these commands, it would have responded with an X-band beep signal, updating the mission controllers on its status and allowing them to investigate the state of the rover further. But even with this new strategy, there was no response from the rover.

The rover had driven {{convert|7730.50|m|mi}} until it became immobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2010.html#sol2335|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011 ===

==== Mission end ====
JPL continued attempts to regain contact with ''Spirit'' until May 25, 2011, when NASA announced the end of contact efforts and the completion of the mission.&lt;ref name="spirit contact conclusion2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spirit contact conclusion1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="universetoday-2011-05-25"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.universetoday.com/85923/end-of-the-road-for-spirit-rover/ |title=End of the Road for Spirit Rover |publisher=Universe Today | author=Atkinson, Nancy |date=May 25, 2011 |accessdate=May 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to NASA, the rover likely experienced excessively cold "internal temperatures" due to "inadequate energy to run its survival heaters" that, in turn, was a result of "a stressful Martian winter without much sunlight."  Many critical components and connections would have been "susceptible to damage from the cold."&lt;ref name="spirit contact conclusion1"/&gt;  Assets that had been needed to support ''Spirit'' were transitioned to support ''Spirit's'' then still-active [[Opportunity rover|''Opportunity'']] rover,&lt;ref name="spirit contact conclusion2"/&gt; and Mars rover ''[[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity]]'' which is exploring Gale Crater and has been doing so for more than six years. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=NASA's Opportunity Rover Mission on Mars Comes to End|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8413/nasas-opportunity-rover-mission-on-mars-comes-to-end|last=mars.nasa.gov|website=NASA’s Mars Exploration Program|language=en|access-date=2020-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discoveries==
The rocks on the plains of Gusev are a type of [[basalt]]. They contain the minerals [[olivine]], [[pyroxene]], [[plagioclase]], and magnetite, and they look like volcanic basalt as they are fine-grained with irregular holes (geologists would say they have vesicles and vugs).&lt;ref name="McSween2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McSween | first1 =  HY| year = 2004 | title = Basaltic Rocks Analyzed by the Spirit Rover in Gusev Crater | url = | journal = Science | volume = 305 | issue = 5685| pages = 842–845 | doi = 10.1126/science.3050842 | pmid = 15297668 | last2 = Arvidson | first2 = RE | last3 = Bell Jf | first3 = 3rd | last4 = Blaney | first4 = D | last5 = Cabrol | first5 = NA | last6 = Christensen | first6 = PR | last7 = Clark | first7 = BC | last8 = Crisp | first8 = JA | last9 = Crumpler | first9 = LS | displayauthors=8 | bibcode = 2004Sci...305..842M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arvidson2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arvidson | first1 = R.

{{Wide image|PIA01907 fig1-MarsSpirit-200604c.jpg |1100px|Annotated panorama of rocks near ''Spirit'' (April, 2006).}} 
Much of the soil on the plains came from the breakdown of the local rocks. Fairly high levels of nickel were found in some soils; probably from [[meteorites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1029/2005JE002555 | title = Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS): Results from Gusev crater and calibration report | year = 2006 | last1 = Gellert | first1 = R. | last2 = Rieder | first2 = R. | last3 = Brückner | first3 = J. | last4 = Clark | first4 = B.

Analysis shows that the rocks have been slightly altered by tiny amounts of water. Outside coatings and cracks inside the rocks suggest water deposited minerals, maybe [[bromine]] compounds. All the rocks contain a fine coating of dust and one or more harder rinds of material. One type can be brushed off, while another needed to be ground off by the [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] (RAT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Christensen | first1 = P. | year = 2004| title = Initial Results from the Mini-TES Experiment in Gusev Crater from the Spirit Rover | url = | journal = Science | volume = 305 | issue = 5685| pages = 837–842 | doi = 10.1126/science.1100564 | pmid = 15297667 | last2 = Ruff | first2 = SW | last3 = Fergason | first3 = RL | last4 = Knudson | first4 = AT | last5 = Anwar | first5 = S | last6 = Arvidson | first6 = RE | last7 = Bandfield | first7 = JL | last8 = Blaney | first8 = DL | last9 = Budney | first9 = C | displayauthors=8 |bibcode = 2004Sci...305..837C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a variety of rocks in the [[Columbia Hills (Mars)|Columbia Hills]], some of which have been altered by water, but not by very much water.

The dust in Gusev Crater is the same as dust all around the planet. All the dust was found to be magnetic. Moreover, ''Spirit'' found the [[magnetism]] was caused by the mineral [[magnetite]], especially magnetite that contained the element [[titanium]]. One magnet was able to completely divert all dust hence all Martian dust is thought to be magnetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bertelsen | first1 = P. | year = 2004 | title = Magnetic Properties on the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit at Gusev Crater | url = | journal = Science | volume = 305 | issue = 5685| pages = 827–829  | doi = 10.1126/science.1100112 | pmid = 15297664 | last2 = Goetz | first2 = W | last3 = Madsen | first3 = MB | last4 = Kinch | first4 = KM | last5 = Hviid | first5 = SF | last6 = Knudsen | first6 = JM | last7 = Gunnlaugsson | first7 = HP | last8 = Merrison | first8 = J | last9 = Nørnberg | first9 = P | displayauthors=8 |bibcode = 2004Sci...305..827B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The spectra of the dust was similar to spectra of bright, low thermal inertia regions like [[Tharsis]] and Arabia that have been detected by orbiting satellites. A thin layer of dust, maybe less than one millimeter thick covers all surfaces. Something in it contains a small amount of chemically bound water.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;Bell, J (ed.)

Observations of rocks on the plains show they contain the minerals pyroxene, olivine, plagioclase, and magnetite. These rocks can be classified in different ways. The amounts and types of minerals make the rocks primitive basalts—also called picritic basalts. The rocks are similar to ancient terrestrial rocks called basaltic [[komatiites]]. Rocks of the plains also resemble the basaltic [[shergottite]]s, meteorites that came from Mars. One classification system compares the amount of alkali elements to the amount of silica on a graph; in this system, Gusev plains rocks lie near the junction of basalt, [[picrobasalt]], and [[tephrite]]. The Irvine-Barager classification calls them basalts.&lt;ref name="McSween2004" /&gt;
Plains rocks have been very slightly altered, probably by thin films of water because they are softer and contain veins of light colored material that may be bromine compounds, as well as coatings or rinds. It is thought that small amounts of water may have gotten into cracks inducing mineralization processes).&lt;ref name="McSween2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arvidson2004" /&gt;
Coatings on the rocks may have occurred when rocks were buried and interacted with thin films of water and dust.
One sign that they were altered was that it was easier to grind these rocks compared to the same types of rocks found on Earth.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Columbia Hills===
Scientists found a variety of rock types in the Columbia Hills, and they placed them into six different categories. The six are: Clovis, Wishbone, Peace, Watchtower, Backstay, and Independence. They are named after a prominent rock in each group. Their chemical compositions, as measured by APXS, are significantly different from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1029/2005JE002562 | title = Rocks of the Columbia Hills | year = 2006 | last1 = Squyres | first1 = Steven W. | last2 = Arvidson | first2 = Raymond E. | last3 = Blaney | first3 = Diana L. | last4 = Clark | first4 = Benton C. | last5 = Crumpler | first5 = Larry | last6 = Farrand | first6 = William H. | last7 = Gorevan | first7 = Stephen | last8 = Herkenhoff | first8 = Kenneth E. | last9 = Hurowitz | first9 = Joel | displayauthors=8 | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 111 | issue = E2 | pages = n/a | bibcode=2006JGRE..111.2S11S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most importantly, all of the rocks in Columbia Hills show various degrees of alteration due to aqueous fluids.&lt;ref name="Ming2005JE002560"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1029/2005JE002560 | title = Geochemical and mineralogical indicators for aqueous processes in the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater, Mars | year = 2006 | last1 = Ming | first1 = D.

They are enriched in the elements phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, and bromine—all of which can be carried around in water solutions. The Columbia Hills' rocks contain basaltic glass, along with varying amounts of olivine and [[sulfate]]s.&lt;ref name="Schroder2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, P.R. (2005) Mineral Composition and Abundance of the Rocks and Soils at Gusev and Meridiani from the Mars Exploration Rover Mini-TES Instruments AGU Joint Assembly, May 23–27, 2005 http://www.agu.org/meetings/sm05/waissm05.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The olivine abundance varies inversely with the amount of sulfates. This is exactly what is expected because water destroys olivine but helps to produce sulfates.

Acid fog is believed to have changed some of the Watchtower rocks.  This was in a {{convert|200|m|ft}} long section of Cumberland Ridge and the Husband Hill summit.  Certain places became less crystalline and more amorphous.  Acidic water vapor from volcanoes  dissolved some minerals forming a gel.  When water evaporated a cement formed and produced small bumps.  This type of process has been observed in the lab when basalt rocks are exposed to sulfuric and hydrochloric acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceref.com/mars/signs-of-acid-fog-found-on-mars.html|title=Signs of Acid Fog Found on Mars – SpaceRef|website=spaceref.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2015AM/webprogram/Paper266774.html|title=Abstract: In-situ Evidence for Alteration by Acid Fog on Husband Hill, Gusev Crater, Mars.

The Clovis group is especially interesting because the [[Mössbauer spectrometer]] (MB) detected [[goethite]] in it.&lt;ref&gt;Klingelhofer, G., et al. (2005) Lunar Planet. Sci. XXXVI abstr. 2349&lt;/ref&gt; Goethite forms only in the presence of water, so its discovery is the first direct evidence of past water in the Columbia Hills's rocks. In addition, the MB spectra of rocks and outcrops displayed a strong decline in olivine presence,&lt;ref name="Schroder2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schroder | first1 = C. | year = 2005 | title = European Geosciences Union, General Assembly | url = | journal = Geophysical Research Abstracts | volume = 7 | page = 10254 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
although the rocks probably once contained much olivine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1029/2005JE002584 | title = Mössbauer mineralogy of rock, soil, and dust at Gusev crater, Mars: Spirit's journey through weakly altered olivine basalt on the plains and pervasively altered basalt in the Columbia Hills | year = 2006 | last1 = Morris | first1 = R.

Sulfate was found, and it needs water to form. 
Wishstone contained a great deal of plagioclase, some olivine, and [[anhydrate]] (a sulfate). Peace rocks showed [[sulfur]] and strong evidence for bound water, so hydrated sulfates are suspected. Watchtower class rocks lack olivine consequently they may have been altered by water. The Independence class showed some signs of clay (perhaps montmorillonite a member of the smectite group). Clays require fairly long term exposure to water to form.
One type of soil, called Paso Robles, from the Columbia Hills, may be an evaporate deposit because it contains large amounts of sulfur, [[phosphorus]], [[calcium]], and iron.&lt;ref name="Ming2005JE002560" /&gt;
Also, MB found that much of the iron in Paso Robles soil was of the oxidized, Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; form, which would happen if water had been present.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt;

Towards the middle of the six-year mission (a mission that was supposed to last only 90 days), large amounts of pure [[silica]] were found in the soil.&lt;ref name="Sky &amp; Telescope"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/19177609.html|title=Mars Rover Uncovers Ancient Hot Springs|publisher=SkyandTelescope.com|date=2008-05-22|accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The silica could have come from the interaction of soil with acid vapors produced by volcanic activity in the presence of water or from water in a hot spring environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/mer-20070521.html|title=NASA – Mars Rover Spirit Unearths Surprise Evidence of Wetter Past|website=www.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Spirit'' stopped working scientists studied old data from the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or [[Mini-TES]] and confirmed the presence of large amounts of [[carbonate]]-rich rocks, which means that regions of the planet may have once harbored water. The carbonates were discovered in an outcrop of rocks called "Comanche."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/06/100603140959.htm|title=Outcrop of long-sought rare rock on Mars found}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1189667 | title = Identification of Carbonate-Rich Outcrops on Mars by the Spirit Rover | year = 2010 | last1 = Morris | first1 = R.

In summary, ''Spirit'' found evidence of slight weathering on the plains of Gusev, but no evidence that a lake was there. However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates that only form in the presence of water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials. All the dust contains a magnetic component that was identified as magnetite with some titanium. Furthermore, the thin coating of dust that covers everything on Mars is the same in all parts of Mars.

''Spirit'' pointed its cameras towards the sky and observed a [[astronomical transit|transit]] of the [[Sun]] by Mars' [[natural satellite|moon]] [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] (see [[Transit of Deimos from Mars]]). It also took the first photo of Earth from the surface of another planet in early March 2004.

In late 2005, ''Spirit'' took advantage of a favorable energy situation to make multiple nighttime observations of both of Mars' moons [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]].&lt;ref name="pancam"&gt;Jim Bell (Cornell University) et al. [http://pancam.astro.cornell.edu/pancam_instrument/projects_2.html Pancam Projects: Spirit Night-time Imaging]. Retrieved 2008-10-21&lt;/ref&gt; These observations included a "[[lunar eclipse|lunar]]" (or rather phobian) [[eclipse]] as ''Spirit'' watched Phobos disappear into Mars' shadow. Some of ''Spirit'''s star gazing was designed to look for a predicted [[meteor shower]] caused by [[Halley's Comet]], and although at least four imaged streaks were suspect meteors, they could not be unambiguously differentiated from those caused by cosmic rays.&lt;ref name="pancam" /&gt;

A [[transit of Mercury from Mars]] took place on January 12, 2005 from about 14:45 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] to 23:05 UTC. Theoretically, this could have been observed by both ''Spirit'' and ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]''; however, camera resolution did not permit seeing Mercury's [[Arc second|6.1"]] angular diameter. They were able to observe transits of [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] across the Sun, but at [[Arc minute|2']] angular diameter, Deimos is about 20 times larger than Mercury's 6.1" angular diameter. Ephemeris data generated by [[JPL Horizons]] indicates that ''Opportunity'' would have been able to observe the transit from the start until local sunset at about 19:23 UTC Earth time, while ''Spirit'' would have been able to observe it from local sunrise at about 19:38 UTC until the end of the transit.{{Clarify|date=October 2008}}&lt;!-- the nasa.gov URL does not state any of this; need instructions on how to verify this --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons|title=HORIZONS System|first=Alan|last=Chamberlin|website=ssd.jpl.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment wear and failures==
Both rovers passed their original mission time of 90 sols many times over. The extended time on the surface, and therefore additional stress on components, resulted in some issues developing.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

On March 13, 2006 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2006|03|13}}), the right front wheel ceased working&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-b.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mer/images.cfm/images.cfm?id=1906|title=JPL.NASA.GOV: Mars Exploration Rovers|website=www-b.jpl.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; after having covered {{Convert|4.2|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} on Mars. Engineers began driving the rover backwards, dragging the dead wheel. Although this resulted in changes to driving techniques, the dragging effect became a useful tool, partially clearing away soil on the surface as the rover traveled, thus allowing areas to be imaged that would normally be inaccessible. However, in mid-December 2009, to the surprise of the engineers, the right front wheel showed slight movement in a wheel-test on sol 2113 and clearly rotated with normal resistance on three of four wheel-tests on sol 2117, but stalled on the fourth. On November 29, 2009 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2009|11|29}}), the right rear wheel also stalled and remained inoperable for the remainder of the mission.

Scientific instruments also experienced degradation as a result of exposure to the harsh Martian environment and use over a far longer period than had been anticipated by the mission planners. Over time, the diamond in the resin grinding surface of the [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] wore down, after that the device could only be used to brush targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/rover/Roverextension.html|title=NASAʼs Mars rovers and Steve Squyres keep going and going – Cornell Chronicle|website=www.news.cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the other science instruments and engineering cameras continued to function until contact was lost; however, towards the end of ''Spirit'''s life, the [[MIMOS II]] [[Mössbauer spectrometer]] took much longer to produce results than it did earlier in the mission because of the decay of its [[cobalt]]-57 gamma ray source that has a half life of 271 days.

===To rover===
To commemorate ''Spirit'''s great contribution to the [[exploration of Mars]], the [[asteroid]]  [[37452 Spirit]] has been named after it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/spotlight/20041011.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: Spotlight|website=marsrovers.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was proposed by [[Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld]] who along with [[Cornelis Johannes van Houten]] and [[Tom Gehrels]] discovered the asteroid on September 24, 1960.

[[Reuben H. Fleet Science Center]] and the [[Liberty Science Center]] also have an IMAX show called ''Roving Mars'' that documents the journey of both ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'', using both CG and actual imagery.

January 4, 2014 was celebrated as the tenth anniversary of its landing on many news sites, despite nearly four years since loss of communications.&lt;ref name=spacef&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1401/03spirit/#.Usha7iddhCo|title=Spaceflight Now – Mars Exploration Rovers – Revered Spirit rover landed on Mars a decade ago|website=www.spaceflightnow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To honor the rover, the JPL team named an area near [[Endeavour (crater)|Endeavour Crater]] explored by the [[Opportunity (rover)|''Opportunity'' rover]], 'Spirit Point'.&lt;ref name="NASA-20110810"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Greicius |first1=Tony |last2=Dunbar |first2=Brian |title=Arrival at 'Spirit Point' by Mars Rover Opportunity |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/multimedia/gallery/pia14509.html |date=August 10, 2011 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===From rover===
On January 27, 2004 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|27}}) NASA memorialized the crew of [[Apollo 1]] by naming three hills to the north of "''Columbia'' Memorial Station" as the [[Apollo 1 Hills]]. On February 2, 2004 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|02|02}}) the astronauts on Space Shuttle ''Columbia''{{'}}s [[STS-107|final mission]] were further memorialized when NASA named a set of hills to the east of the landing site the [[Columbia Hills (Mars)|Columbia Hills Complex]], denoting seven peaks in that area as "Anderson", "Brown", "Chawla", "Clark", "Husband", "McCool", and "Ramon"; NASA has submitted these geographical feature names to the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] for approval.

==Gallery==
The rover can take pictures  with its different cameras. But only the PanCam camera has the ability to photograph a scene with different color filters. The panorama views are usually built up from PanCam images. ''Spirit'' has transferred 128,224 pictures in its lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/all/spirit.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover|last=mars.nasa.gov|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
