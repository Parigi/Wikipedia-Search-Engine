'''''The 20/20 Experience''''' is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter [[Justin Timberlake]]. It was released on March 15, 2013, by [[RCA Records]], as the follow-up to his second studio album ''[[FutureSex/LoveSounds]]'' (2006). It is considered the first half of a two-piece project, later being supplemented by his fourth studio album ''[[The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2]]'' (2013). The album incorporates [[neo soul]] styles with elements of older [[soul music]]; its lyrics discuss themes of romance and sex. Production is handled by [[Timbaland]], Timberlake, who also serves as the album's executive producer, and [[J-Roc|Jerome "J-Roc" Harmon]], with [[Rob Knox (producer)|Rob Knox]] contributing to the album's deluxe edition.

''The 20/20 Experience'' received generally positive reviews from critics, many of whom praised its organic sound and hailed it as a significant pop release. The album debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 968,000 copies – the biggest sales week of the year, becoming Timberlake's second number one album on the chart and best-selling debut week of his solo career. ''The 20/20 Experience'' became the [[List of best-selling albums by year in the United States|best-selling album]] of 2013 in the US, making it the [[List of Billboard Year-End number-one singles and albums|''Billboard'' Year-End number-one album]]. The album also became Timberlake's third consecutive number-one album in the United Kingdom, topped the charts in various other countries and set a digital sales record for being the fastest-selling album on the [[iTunes Store]]. As of July 2014, joint sales of ''The 20/20 Experience'' with ''[[The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2|2 of 2]]'' stands at six million copies globally.

Three singles have been released from ''The 20/20 Experience''. Its lead single, "[[Suit &amp; Tie]]", peaked within the top five in several countries worldwide, and reached number three in the US. The album's second single, "[[Mirrors (Justin Timberlake song)|Mirrors]]", reached number one in the UK and two in the US. Timberlake embarked on the [[Legends of the Summer|Legends of the Summer Stadium Tour]] with [[Jay-Z]] to further promote the album, as well as [[The 20/20 Experience World Tour]]. The album, as part of the compilation ''[[The 20/20 Experience – The Complete Experience]]'', was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in the category [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]]. "Suit and Tie" and "[[Pusher Love Girl]]" won for [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Best Music Video]] and [[Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song|Best R&amp;B Song]], respectively.

The two had general decisions about ways to release new music, because according to Wright, "a lot of the physical record sellers were gone, by the time we've got music again we need to think about different ways to deliver it".&lt;ref name="album development"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/branding/1552474/justin-timberlake-manager-johnny-wright-on-secret-plans-around?page=0%2C1|title=Justin Timberlake Manager Johnny Wright on Secret Plans Around '20/20 Experience,' Touring, Myspace, More|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Aswad|first=Jem|date=March 19, 2013|accessdate=March 22, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324002255/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/branding/1552474/justin-timberlake-manager-johnny-wright-on-secret-plans-around?page=0%2C1|archivedate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright proposed a promotion based on an [[application software|application]] or releasing a new song every month. Timberlake, however, was not interested in going back into music and instead continued to focus on his film career.&lt;ref name="album development"/&gt; Around the "late part of May/first week in June" 2012, Timberlake asked Wright to dinner and revealed to him that he had spent the last couple of nights in studio with Timbaland working on new material. Wright was shocked at the revelation, telling ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine that he "wasn't prepared for that."&lt;ref name="album development"/&gt; The two immediately began marketing plans for how the album should be promoted and when it should be released. Ultimately, they agreed "to do this in a shorter period of time, so let's put the single out and [release the album] seven or eight weeks after that&amp;nbsp;– make it a short window, and because we have such a short window, we have to make a big impact."&lt;ref name="album development"/&gt;

Subsequently, in August 2012, producer [[Jim Beanz]] reported that Timberlake started working on his new music project.&lt;ref name="August report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2012/08/07/justin-timberlake-new-album-not-happening/|title=Justin Timberlake totally not working on 'crazy' new album, despite what a dude named Jim Beanz says|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Anderson|first=Kyle|date=August 7, 2012|accessdate=January 14, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216045235/http://music-mix.ew.com/2012/08/07/justin-timberlake-new-album-not-happening/|archivedate=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at that time, shortly after the announcement, Timberlake's publicist revealed that there were no current plans for a new Timberlake album, affirming instead that Timberlake was working with Timbaland on songs for his upcoming project ''Shock Value III''.&lt;ref name="August report"/&gt; After the release of ''The 20/20 Experience'', Wright confirmed that the album was finished in the middle of July and described it as a "fast record". Timberlake had four weeks to record the whole material, because he had to shoot his scenes for the film ''[[Runner Runner]]''.&lt;ref name="album development"/&gt; Although, originally planned for release in October 2012, the album's date was postponed because of the singer's wedding with actress [[Jessica Biel]].&lt;ref name="album development"/&gt; Wright stated that although in the project were involved artists who are also primarily Timberlake's friends it was tough keeping the album a secret, making them use codenames for the project.&lt;ref name="album development"/&gt; During an interview with American radio and television host [[Ryan Seacrest]], Timberlake explained the meaning behind the album's title saying, "It more or less came out of: I was playing some of the stuff for my friends and they would come in and out of the studio and I'd say, 'What do you think of this?' And my best friend said, 'This is music that you can see,' and for some reason that stuck with me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rap-up.com/2013/02/06/justin-timberlake-the-20-20-experience-album-cover-tracklisting/ |title=Justin Timberlake Reveals 'The 20/20 Experience' Cover, Tracklisting |work=[[Rap-Up]] |date=February 6, 2013 |accessdate=February 14, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501173420/http://www.rap-up.com/2013/02/06/justin-timberlake-the-20-20-experience-album-cover-tracklisting/ |archivedate=May 1, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mix38.3 (Mar 2014): 21-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regards to the album's lead single "Suit &amp; Tie", Timberlake shared with [[KAMP-FM|97.1 AMP Radio/Los Angeles]] how the classic, "Get out your seat, Hov" lyric was born inside the studio with JAY-Z: "I had finished the verses and I was going in to record them and he was sitting in the room working, freestyling to himself. And then he came up with a line he really liked and he jumped out of his seat and he said, 'Uh oh! Get out of that seat, Hov.' And I just thought it was so funny. It made me laugh. I was standing right beside him when he did it and so I just put it on the record, more or less as a joke to him." Timberlake added that the song harkens back to the glory years of the [[Rat Pack]]. "Not to compare ourselves to those guys, but just the fun that they had," he said. "I was picturing like, being at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino|Sands]] in [[Las Vegas|Vegas]] and saying, 'Oh, JAY-Z's in the house tonight. Uh, let's have him come up and do a number. Why don't you go ahead and get out of your seat, Hov?'

&lt;!--{{Listen|pos=right|filename=Pusher Love Girl.ogg|title="Pusher Love Girl"|description=A 30-second sample of the chorus to "Pusher Love Girl", which features Timberlake's trademark falsetto.}}--&gt;According to Timberlake, the album "goes a lot of different directions.

We'll figure out the radio edits later."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/justin-timberlake/68910 |title=Justin Timberlake: 'If Led Zeppelin can have 10 minute long songs why can't I?'  |work=NME |date=February 26, 2013 |accessdate=March 13, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301050356/http://www.nme.com/news/justin-timberlake/68910 |archivedate=March 1, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The 20/20 Experience'' is a [[neo soul]] album partly inspired by the expansive [[song structure]]s of 1960s and 1970s [[rock music|rock]].&lt;ref name="Tucker"/&gt; The songs have average lengths of seven minutes and are characterized by [[vamp (music)|vamps]], abrupt [[modulation (music)|key changes]], and unexpected rhythms and harmonies.&lt;ref name="Rosen"/&gt; Music journalist [[Jody Rosen]] observed an emphasis on "rhythm and [[flow (music)|flow]]" rather than [[catchiness]], and said that it is "not quite a [[pop music|pop]] album", as its "sense of musical [[spacetime|space-time]] is more elastic and sprawling than anything on the radio".&lt;ref name="Rosen"/&gt; The album's music incorporates [[sampling (music)|samples]] of piano, distorted voices, and buzzing electronic sounds with elements of older [[soul music]], including resonant voiceovers, lush string and horn arrangements, high-pitched guitar solos, and squelching [[analog synthesizer]]s.&lt;ref name="Petridis"/&gt; [[Steven Hyden]] said that the album has "traditionalist tendencies",&lt;ref name="Hyden"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hyden|first=Steven|authorlink=Steven Hyden|date=March 14, 2013|url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9051010/20-observations-justin-timberlake-new-album-20-20-experience|title=20 observations about Justin Timberlake's new album, "The 20/20 Experience"|work=[[Grantland]]|accessdate=March 15, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317080053/http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9051010/20-observations-justin-timberlake-new-album-20-20-experience|archivedate=March 17, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Simon Price]] wrote that producers Timbaland and J-Roc merged 1970s influences with futuristic sounds: "[[the Chi-Lites]] in orbit, [[the Isley Brothers]] gone intergalactic, and so on."
