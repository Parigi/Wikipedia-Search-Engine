'''Henry Leroy Willson''' (July 31, 1911 &amp;ndash; November 2, 1978) was an American [[Hollywood]] [[talent agent]] who played a large role in developing the [[beefcake]] craze of the 1950s. He was known for his stable of young, attractive clients, including [[Rock Hudson]], [[Tab Hunter]], [[Chad Everett]], [[Robert Wagner]], [[Nick Adams (actor, born 1931)|Nick Adams]], [[Guy Madison]], [[Troy Donahue]], [[Mike Connors]], [[Rory Calhoun]], [[John Saxon]], [[Yale Summers]], [[Clint Walker]], [[Doug McClure]], [[Dack Rambo]], [[Ty Hardin]], and [[John Derek]]. He noticed [[Rhonda Fleming]] as she was walking to [[Beverly Hills High School]], brought her to the attention of [[David O. Selznick]], and helped groom her for stardom. He was also instrumental in advancing [[Lana Turner]]'s career.

==Early life==
Willson was born into a prominent [[show business]] family in [[Lansdowne, Pennsylvania|Lansdowne]], [[Pennsylvania]]. His father, Horace, was the vice-president of the [[Columbia Records|Columbia Phonograph Company]] and advanced to the presidency in 1922. Willson came in close contact with many [[Broadway theatre]], [[opera]], and [[vaudeville]] performers. [[Will Rogers]], [[Fanny Brice]], and [[Fred Stone]] numbered among the family's friends, after they moved to [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]], an upscale neighborhood in the [[New York City]] borough of [[Queens, New York|Queens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferber|first=Lawrence|url=http://www.gaylesbiantimes.com/?id=6244|title=Oh, Henry Oh, Henry: The Pretty Boys and Dirty Deeds of Hollywood Agent Henry Willson|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721021757/http://www.gaylesbiantimes.com/?id=6244|archive-date=July 21, 2009|work=[[Gay and Lesbian Times]]|date=November 17, 2005|access-date=June 18, 2009|url-status=unfit|quote=During his youth in Forest Hills, N.Y., Willson was close to his father, a man who both enabled his showbiz obsession and hindered his personal development.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerned about his son's interest in [[tap dance]], the elder Willson enrolled Henry in the [[Asheville School]] in [[North Carolina]], where he hoped the school's many team sports and rugged weekend activities, such as rock climbing and backpacking, would have a positive influence on the boy. He later attended [[Wesleyan University]] in [[Middletown, Connecticut]], spending weekends in [[Manhattan]], where he wrote weekly [[gossip]] columns for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.

==Hollywood years==
In 1933, Willson traveled to Hollywood by steamship via the [[Panama Canal]]. On board he cultivated a friendship with [[Bing Crosby]]'s wife, [[Dixie Lee]], who introduced him to the Hollywood elite and secured him a job with ''[[Photoplay]]'', where his first article was about the newborn [[Gary Crosby (actor)|Gary Crosby]]. He began writing for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' and the ''New Movie Magazine'', became a junior agent at the Joyce &amp; Polimer Agency, moved into a [[Beverly Hills]] home purchased by his father, and became a regular at [[Sunset Strip]] gay bars, where he wooed young men for both professional and personal reasons. One of his first clients (and lovers) was [[Junior Durkin]], whose career was cut short when he died in an automobile accident on May 4, 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Keith|last=Stern|title=Queers in History: The Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Historical Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals|year=2009|location=Dallas, Texas|isbn=978-1933771878|page=493|publisher=BenBella Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Willson joined the [[Zeppo Marx]] Agency, where he represented newcomers [[Marge Champion|Marjorie Belcher]], [[Jon Hall (actor)|Jon Hall]], and [[William T. Orr]]. He was introduced to Judy Turner, a [[Hollywood High School]] student, in 1937, whom he renamed "Lana Turner" and got cast in small roles, finally introducing her to [[Mervyn LeRoy]] at [[Warner Bros.]] In 1943, [[David O. Selznick]] hired Willson to head the talent division of his newly formed Vanguard Pictures. The first film he cast was the [[World War II]] drama ''[[Since You Went Away]]'' (1944) with [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Jennifer Jones (actor)|Jennifer Jones]], and [[Shirley Temple]]. He placed [[Guy Madison]], [[Craig Stevens (actor)|Craig Stevens]], and [[John Derek]] (billed as Dare Harris) in small supporting roles.

Willson eventually opened his own talent agency, where he nurtured the careers of his young finds, frequently coercing them into sexual relationships in exchange for publicity and film roles. In his book, ''Screened Out: Playing Gay in Hollywood from Edison to Stonewall'', [[Richard Barrios]] writes, "talent agent Henry Willson... had a singular knack for discovering and renaming young actors whose visual appeal transcended any lack of ability. Under his tutelage, Robert Mosely became [[Guy Madison]], Orison Whipple Hungerford Jr. was renamed [[Ty Hardin]], Arthur Gelien was changed to [[Tab Hunter]],&lt;ref name="Holden2015"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Holden |first1=Stephen |title=Review: ‘Tab Hunter Confidential,’ About a Heartthrob |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/movies/review-tab-hunter-confidential-about-a-heartthrob.html?searchResultPosition=8 |accessdate=12 May 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Roy Scherer turned into [[Rock Hudson]]. So successful was the [[beefcake]] aspect of this enterprise, and so widely recognized was Willson's sexuality, that it was often, and often inaccurately, assumed that all of his clients were gay." [[Suzanne Finstad]] confirms that "some of the would-be actors Willson represented were heterosexual, but a disproportionate number were homosexual, bisexual, or 'co-operated' with Willson 'to get gigs,' in the observation of Natalie [Wood]'s costar [[Bobby Hyatt]].&amp;nbsp;..." "if a young, handsome actor had Henry Willson for an agent, 'it was almost assumed he was gay, like it was written across his forehead,' recalls [[Ann Doran]], one of Willson's few female clients."&lt;ref&gt;[[Suzanne Finstad|Finstad, Suzanne]] (2001). ''Natasha: The Biography of Natalie Wood''. p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

His most prominent client was Rock Hudson, whom he transformed from a clumsy, naive, [[Chicago]]-born truck driver named Roy Scherer into one of Hollywood's most popular leading men. The two were teamed professionally until 1966. In 1955, ''[[Confidential (magazine)|Confidential]]'' magazine threatened to publish an exposé about Hudson's secret homosexual life, and Willson disclosed information about [[Rory Calhoun]]'s years in prison and Tab Hunter's arrest at a gay party in 1950 in exchange for the tabloid not printing the Hudson story. At his agent's urging, Hudson married Willson's secretary [[Phyllis Gates]] in order to put the rumors to rest and maintain a macho image, but the union dissolved after three years.

==Later years and death==
In his later years, Willson struggled with drug addiction, alcoholism, paranoia, and weight problems. Because his own homosexuality had become public knowledge, many of his clients, both gay and straight, distanced themselves from him for fear of being branded the same. In 1974, the unemployed and destitute agent moved into the [[Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital]], where he remained until he died of [[cirrhosis]] of the liver. With no money to cover the cost of a gravestone, he was interred in an unmarked grave in [[Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery]] in North Hollywood, California. A headstone was eventually placed at his burial site with the epitaph "Star - Star Maker".

==In popular culture==
Willson is portrayed by [[Jim Parsons]] in the 2020 [[Netflix]] miniseries ''[[Hollywood (miniseries)|Hollywood]]'', a revisionist tale of post World War II Hollywood&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/entertainment/a32416971/rock-hudson-true-story-netflix-hollywood/ |title=The Heartbreaking True Story About Rock Hudson That Netflix's 'Hollywood' Left Out |format= |accessdate=May 10, 2020 |url-status=live|archiveurl= |archivedate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;.
