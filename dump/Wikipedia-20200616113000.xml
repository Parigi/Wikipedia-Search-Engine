== Background ==
{{Main article|Epigenetics}}
In [[biology]], and specifically [[genetics]], epigenetics is the study of [[heritable]] changes in [[gene]] activity which are ''not'' caused by changes in the [[DNA]] sequence; the term can also be used to describe the study of stable, long-term alterations in the transcriptional potential of a cell that are not necessarily heritable.&lt;ref name="pmid17522671"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bird A | title = Perceptions of epigenetics | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7143 | pages = 396–8 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17522671 | doi = 10.1038/nature05913 | bibcode = 2007Natur.447..396B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview of the Roadmap Epigenomics Project |url=http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of mechanisms that produce such changes are [[DNA methylation]]&lt;ref name="pmid18940229"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mehler MF | title = Epigenetic principles and mechanisms underlying nervous system functions in health and disease | journal = Progress in Neurobiology | volume = 86 | issue = 4 | pages = 305–41 | date = Dec 2008 | pmid = 18940229 | pmc = 2636693 | doi =  10.1016/j.pneurobio.2008.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[histone modification]],&lt;ref name="Maze_2011"/&gt; each of which alters how genes are expressed without altering the underlying [[DNA sequence]]. Gene expression can be controlled through the action of repressor proteins that attach to [[silencer (DNA)|silencer]] regions of the DNA. 
[[Image:Epigenetic mechanisms.png|thumb|Modifications of the [[epigenome]] do not alter DNA.]]

DNA methylation turns a gene "off" – it results in the inability of genetic information to be read from DNA; removing the methyl tag can turn the gene back "on".&lt;ref name="Reik_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reik W | title = Stability and flexibility of epigenetic gene regulation in mammalian development | journal = Nature | volume = 447 | issue = 7143 | pages = 425–32 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17522676 | doi = 10.1038/nature05918 | bibcode = 2007Natur.447..425R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottesman"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gottesman II, Hanson DR | title = Human development: biological and genetic processes | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 56 | issue =  | pages = 263–86 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15709936 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epigenetics has a strong influence on the development of an organism and can alter the expression of individual traits.&lt;ref name="pmid11498570"/&gt;  Epigenetic changes occur not only in the developing fetus, but also in individuals throughout the human life-span.&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Campbell IC, Mill J, Uher R, Schmidt U | title = Eating disorders, gene-environment interactions and epigenetics | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 784–93 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 20888360 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.09.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Because some epigenetic modifications can be passed from one generation to the next,&lt;ref name="Goto_1998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goto T, Monk M | title = Regulation of X-chromosome inactivation in development in mice and humans | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 62 | issue = 2 | pages = 362–78 | date = Jun 1998 | pmid = 9618446 | pmc = 98919 | doi =  10.1128/MMBR.62.2.362-378.1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequent generations may be affected by the epigenetic changes that took place in the parents.&lt;ref name="Goto_1998"/&gt;

== Discovery ==

The first documented example of epigenetics affecting behavior was provided by [[Michael Meaney]] and [[Moshe Szyf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weaver IC, Cervoni N, Champagne FA, D'Alessio AC, Sharma S, Seckl JR, Dymov S, Szyf M, Meaney MJ | title = Epigenetic programming by maternal behavior | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = 8 | pages = 847–54 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15220929 | doi = 10.1038/nn1276 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While working at [[McGill University]] in [[Montréal]] in 2004, they discovered that the type and amount of nurturing a mother rat provides in the early weeks of the rat's [[infancy]] determines how that rat responds to [[stress (psychological)|stress]] later in life.&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt; This stress sensitivity was linked to a [[Regulation of gene expression#Up-regulation and down-regulation|down-regulation]] in the expression of the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] in the brain.  In turn, this down-regulation was found to be a consequence of the extent of [[Methylation#Epigenetics|methylation]] in the [[promoter (genetics)|promoter]] region of the glucocorticoid receptor [[gene]].&lt;ref name="Miller_2010"/&gt; Immediately after birth, Meaney and Szyf found that [[methyl group]]s repress the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] gene in all rat pups, making the gene unable to unwind from the histone in order to be transcribed, causing a decreased stress response. Nurturing behaviours from the mother rat were found to stimulate activation of stress signalling pathways that remove methyl groups from DNA. This releases the tightly wound gene, exposing it for transcription. The glucocorticoid gene is activated, resulting in lowered stress response. Rat pups that receive a less nurturing upbringing are more sensitive to stress throughout their life-span.

This pioneering work in rodents has been difficult to replicate in humans because of a general lack of availability human brain tissue for measurement of epigenetic changes.&lt;ref name="Miller_2010"/&gt;

== Research into epigenetics in psychology ==

=== Anxiety and risk-taking ===
[[Image:TwinGirls.jpg|right|thumb|[[Twin#Monozygotic ("identical") twins|Monozygotic twins]] are identical twins. [[Twin studies]] help to reveal epigenetic differences related to various aspects of psychology.]]
In a small clinical study in humans published in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaminsky Z, Petronis A, Wang SC, Levine B, Ghaffar O, Floden D, Feinstein A | title = Epigenetics of personality traits: an illustrative study of identical twins discordant for risk-taking behavior | journal = Twin Research and Human Genetics | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–11 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18251670 | doi = 10.1375/twin.11.1.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, epigenetic differences were linked to differences in risk-taking and reactions to stress in [[Twin#Monozygotic ("identical") twins|monozygotic twins]].&lt;ref name="Kaminsky_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaminsky Z, Petronis A, Wang SC, Levine B, Ghaffar O, Floden D, Feinstein A | title = Epigenetics of personality traits: an illustrative study of identical twins discordant for risk-taking behavior | journal = Twin Research and Human Genetics | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–11 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18251670 | doi = 10.1375/twin.11.1.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study identified twins with different life paths, wherein one twin displayed risk-taking behaviours, and the other displayed risk-averse behaviours.  Epigenetic differences in [[DNA methylation]] of the [[CpG island]]s proximal to the [[DLX1]] gene correlated with the differing behavior.&lt;ref name="Kaminsky_2008"/&gt;   The authors of the twin study noted that despite the associations between epigenetic markers and differences personality traits, epigenetics cannot predict complex decision-making processes like career selection.&lt;ref name="Kaminsky_2008"/&gt;

=== Stress ===
[[Image:Basic HPA Axis.jpeg|right|thumb|The [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis]] is involved in the [[Stress (biology)|human stress response]].]]
Animal and human studies have found correlations between poor care during infancy and epigenetic changes that correlate with long-term impairments that result from neglect.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =Masterpasqua F | title = Psychology and epigenetics | journal = Review of General Psychology | year = 2009 | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 194–201 |pmid = | doi = 10.1037/a0016301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Szyf and McGowan"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Szyf M, McGowan P, Meaney MJ | title = The social environment and the epigenome | journal = Environmental and Molecular Mutagenesis | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 46–60 | date = Jan 2008 | pmid = 18095330 | doi = 10.1002/em.20357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gonzalez-Pardo&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = González-Pardo H, Pérez Álvarez M | title = Epigenetics and its implications for Psychology | journal = Psicothema | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–12 | date = Feb 2013 | pmid = 23336536 | doi = 10.7334/psicothema2012.327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in rats have shown correlations between maternal care in terms of the parental licking of offspring and epigenetic changes.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua/&gt; A high level of licking results in a long-term reduction in stress response as measured behaviorally and biochemically in elements of the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA).  Further, decreased DNA methylation of the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] gene were found in offspring that experienced a high level of licking; the glucorticoid receptor plays a key role in regulating the HPA.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua /&gt;  The opposite is found in offspring that experienced low levels of licking, and when pups are switched,  the epigenetic changes are reversed. This research provides evidence for an underlying epigenetic mechanism.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua /&gt;  Further support comes from experiments with the same setup, using drugs that can increase or decrease methylation.&lt;ref name="Szyf and McGowan"/&gt;  Finally, epigenetic variations in parental care can be passed down from one generation to the next, from mother to female offspring. Female offspring who received increased parental care (i.e., high licking) became mothers who engaged in high licking and offspring who received less licking became mothers who engaged in less licking.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua /&gt;

In humans, a small clinical research study showed the relationship between prenatal exposure to maternal [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] and genetic expression resulting in increased reactivity to stress in offspring.&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt; Three groups of infants were examined: those born to mothers medicated for [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] with [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|serotonin reuptake inhibitors]]; those born to depressed mothers not being treated for depression; and those born to non-depressed mothers. Prenatal exposure to depressed/anxious mood was associated with increased DNA methylation at the glucocorticoid receptor gene and to increased HPA axis stress reactivity.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua /&gt;  The findings were independent of whether the mothers were being pharmaceutically treated for depression.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua /&gt;

Recent research has also shown the relationship of methylation of the maternal glucocorticoid receptor and maternal neural activity in response to mother-infant interactions on video.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Moser DA, Giacobino A, Stenz L, Gex-Fabry M, Adouan W, Cordero MI, Suardi F, Manini A, Sancho-Rossignol A, Merminod G, Aue T, Ansermet F, Dayer AG, Rusconi-Serpa S. (epub May 29, 2015)  Methylation of NR3C1 is related to maternal PTSD, parenting stress and maternal medial prefrontal cortical activity in response to child separation among mothers with histories of violence exposure. Frontiers in Psychology. http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00690/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;  Longitudinal follow-up of those infants will be important to understand the impact of early caregiving in this high-risk population on child epigenetics and behavior.

=== Learning and memory ===
A 2010 review discusses the role of DNA methylation in memory formation and storage, but the precise mechanisms involving neuronal function, memory, and methylation reversal remain unclear.&lt;ref name="Day and Sweatt"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Day JJ, Sweatt JD | title = DNA methylation and memory formation | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 13 | issue = 11 | pages = 1319–23 | date = Nov 2010 | pmid = 20975755 | pmc = 3130618 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental and epigenetic influences seem to work together to increase the risk of [[addiction]].&lt;ref name="Wong_2011"/&gt; For example, environmental stress has been shown to increase the risk of [[substance abuse]].&lt;ref name="Andersen and Teicher"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersen SL, Teicher MH | title = Desperately driven and no brakes: developmental stress exposure and subsequent risk for substance abuse | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 516–24 | date = Apr 2009 | pmid = 18938197 | pmc = 2688959 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.09.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to cope with stress, [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[Psychoactive drug|drugs]] can be used as an escape.&lt;ref name=Carver&gt;{{cite book | vauthors =  Carver C | chapter = Coping | veditors = Baum A, Contrada RJ | title = The Handbook of Stress Science: Biology, Psychology, and Health | edition = | publisher = Springer Publishing Company | location = New York | year = 2010  | pages = 223 | quote = | isbn = 978-0-8261-1471-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once substance abuse commences, however, epigenetic alterations may further exacerbate the biological and behavioural changes associated with addiction.&lt;ref name="Wong_2011"/&gt;

Even short-term substance abuse can produce long-lasting epigenetic changes in the brain of rodents,&lt;ref name="Wong_2011"/&gt; via DNA methylation and histone modification.&lt;ref name="Maze_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maze I, Nestler EJ | title = The epigenetic landscape of addiction | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1216 | issue =  1| pages = 99–113 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21272014 | pmc = 3071632 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05893.x | bibcode = 2011NYASA1216...99M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epigenetic modifications have been observed in studies on rodents involving [[ethanol]], [[nicotine]], [[cocaine]], [[amphetamine]], [[methamphetamine]] and [[opiate]]s.&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt; Specifically, these epigenetic changes modify gene expression, which in turn increases the vulnerability of an individual to engage in repeated substance overdose in the future. In turn, increased substance abuse results in even greater epigenetic changes in various components of a rodent's [[reward system]]&lt;ref name="Wong_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wong CC, Mill J, Fernandes C | title = Drugs and addiction: an introduction to epigenetics | journal = Addiction | volume = 106 | issue = 3 | pages = 480–9 | date = Mar 2011 | pmid = 21205049 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03321.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., in the [[nucleus accumbens]]&lt;ref name="Renthal and Nestler"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Renthal W, Nestler EJ | title = Epigenetic mechanisms in drug addiction | journal = Trends in Molecular Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 8 | pages = 341–50 | date = Aug 2008 | pmid = 18635399 | pmc = 2753378 | doi = 10.1016/j.molmed.2008.06.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Hence, a cycle emerges whereby changes in areas of the [[reward system]] contribute to the long-lasting neural and behavioural changes associated with the increased likelihood of addiction, the maintenance of addiction and [[relapse]].&lt;ref name="Wong_2011"/&gt; In humans, alcohol consumption has been shown to produce epigenetic changes that contribute to the increased craving of alcohol. As such, epigenetic modifications may play a part in the progression from the controlled intake to the loss of control of alcohol consumption.&lt;ref name=Naassila&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Naassila M | title = Abstracts of ESBRA 2011, European Society for Biomedical Research on Alcoholism.

These include: repetitive habits that increase the risk of disease, and personal and social problems; need for immediate [[gratification]]; high rates of relapse following treatment; and, the feeling of loss of control.&lt;ref name="Marlatt et al"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marlatt GA, Baer JS, Donovan DM, Kivlahan DR | title = Addictive behaviors: etiology and treatment | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 39 | issue =  | pages = 223–52 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3278676 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ps.39.020188.001255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for related epigenetic changes has come from human studies involving alcohol,&lt;ref name="Bonsch et al"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bönsch D, Lenz B, Reulbach U, Kornhuber J, Bleich S | title = Homocysteine associated genomic DNA hypermethylation in patients with chronic alcoholism | journal = Journal of Neural Transmission | volume = 111 | issue = 12 | pages = 1611–6 | date = Dec 2004 | pmid = 15565495 | doi = 10.1007/s00702-004-0232-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; nicotine, and opiate abuse. Evidence for epigenetic changes stemming from amphetamine and cocaine abuse derives from animal studies. In animals, drug-related epigenetic changes in fathers have also been shown to negatively affect offspring in terms of poorer spatial [[working memory]], decreased [[attention]] and decreased [[cerebral volume]].&lt;ref name="He et al"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = He F, Lidow IA, Lidow MS | title = Consequences of paternal cocaine exposure in mice | journal = Neurotoxicology and Teratology | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 198–209 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16458479 | doi = 10.1016/j.ntt.2005.12.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eating disorders and obesity ===
{{further|ΔFosB}}
Epigenetic changes may help to facilitate the development and maintenance of [[eating disorder]]s via influences in the early environment and throughout the life-span.&lt;ref name="Campbell_2011"/&gt; [[Pre-natal]] epigenetic changes due to maternal stress, behaviour and diet may later predispose offspring to persistent, increased anxiety and [[anxiety disorders]]. These anxiety issues can precipitate the onset of eating disorders and [[obesity]], and persist even after recovery from the eating disorders.&lt;ref name="pmid18213688"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raney TJ, Thornton LM, Berrettini W, Brandt H, Crawford S, Fichter MM, Halmi KA, Johnson C, Kaplan AS, LaVia M, Mitchell J, Rotondo A, Strober M, Woodside DB, Kaye WH, Bulik CM | title = Influence of overanxious disorder of childhood on the expression of anorexia nervosa | journal = The International Journal of Eating Disorders | volume = 41 | issue = 4 | pages = 326–32 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18213688 | doi = 10.1002/eat.20508 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epigenetic differences accumulating over the life-span may account for the incongruent differences in eating disorders observed in monozygotic twins. At [[puberty]], [[sex hormones]] may exert epigenetic changes (via DNA methylation) on gene expression, thus accounting for higher rates of eating disorders in men as compared to women. Overall, epigenetics contribute to persistent, unregulated [[self-control]] behaviours related to the urge to [[Binge eating|binge]].&lt;ref name="Campbell_2011"/&gt;

=== Schizophrenia ===
{{details|Epigenetics of schizophrenia}}
Epigenetic changes including hypomethylation of glutamatergic genes (i.e., NMDA-receptor-subunit gene [[NMDA receptor|NR3B]] and the promoter of the AMPA-receptor-subunit gene [[GRIA2]]) in the post-mortem human brains of schizophrenics are associated with increased levels of the neurotransmitter [[glutamic acid|glutamate]].&lt;ref name="Mostafavi-Abdolmaleky"&gt;{{cite book |veditors=Bronner F, Helmtrud I |title=Epigenetic Aspects of Chronic Diseases |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-84882-643-4 |vauthors=Mostafavi-Abdolmaleky H, Glatt SJ, Tsuang MT |chapter=Epigenetics in Psychiatry |pages=163–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since glutamate is the most prevalent, fast, excitatory neurotransmitter, increased levels may result in the [[psychotic episodes]] related to [[schizophrenia]]. Epigenetic changes affecting a greater number of genes have been detected in men with schizophrenia as compared to women with the illness.&lt;ref name="Abdolmaleky_2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Abdolmaleky HM, Thiagalingam S, Wilcox M |title=Genetics and epigenetics in major psychiatric disorders: dilemmas, achievements, applications, and future scope |journal=American Journal of Pharmacogenomics |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=149–60 |year=2005 |pmid=15952869 |doi=10.2165/00129785-200505030-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Population studies have established a strong association linking schizophrenia in children born to older fathers.&lt;ref name="Malaspina_2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Malaspina D, Harlap S, Fennig S, Heiman D, Nahon D, Feldman D, Susser ES | title = Advancing paternal age and the risk of schizophrenia | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 58 | issue = 4 | pages = 361–7 | date = Apr 2001 | pmid = 11296097 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.58.4.361 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rutten_2009"/&gt; Specifically, children born to fathers over the age of 35 years are up to three times more likely to develop schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="Rutten_2009"/&gt; Epigenetic dysfunction in human male [[sperm cells]], affecting numerous genes, have been shown to increase with age.

As such, many other environmental factors (e.g., [[nutritional deficiencies]] and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] use) have been proposed to increase the susceptibility of [[psychotic disorder]]s like schizophrenia via epigenetics.&lt;ref name="Rutten_2009"/&gt;

=== Bipolar disorder ===

Evidence for epigenetic modifications for [[bipolar disorder]] is unclear.&lt;ref name="McGowan_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McGowan PO, Kato T | title = Epigenetics in mood disorders | journal = Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–24 | date = Jan 2008 | pmid = 19568875 | pmc = 2698240 | doi = 10.1007/s12199-007-0002-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found hypomethylation of a [[gene promoter]] of a [[frontal lobe|prefrontal lobe]] enzyme (i.e., membrane-bound [[catechol-O-methyl transferase]], or COMT) in post-mortem brain samples from individuals with bipolar disorder. COMT is an enzyme that [[metabolize]]s [[dopamine]] in the [[synapse]]. These findings suggest that the hypomethylation of the [[promoter (genetics)|promoter]] results in over-expression of the enzyme.

Limited access to human brain tissue poses a challenge to conducting human research.&lt;ref name="Powledge_2011" /&gt; Not yet knowing if epigenetic changes in the blood and (non-brain) tissues parallel modifications in the brain, places even greater reliance on brain research.&lt;ref name="Albert_2010"/&gt; Although some epigenetic studies have translated findings from animals to humans,&lt;ref name="McGowan_2009"/&gt; some researchers caution about the extrapolation of animal studies to humans.&lt;ref name="Miller_2010" /&gt; One view notes that when animal studies do not consider how the subcellular and  cellular components, organs and the entire individual interact with the influences of the environment, results are too reductive to explain behaviour.&lt;ref name="Kalant_2010" /&gt;

Some researchers note that epigenetic perspectives will likely be incorporated into pharmacological treatments.&lt;ref name="pmid18197504" /&gt; Others caution that more research is necessary as drugs are known to modify the activity of multiple genes and may, therefore, cause serious side effects.&lt;ref name="Miller_2010" /&gt; However, the ultimate goal is to find patterns of epigenetic changes that can be targeted to treat mental illness, and reverse the effects of childhood stressors, for example. If such treatable patterns eventually become well-established, the inability to access brains in living humans to identify them poses an obstacle to pharmacological treatment.&lt;ref name="Albert_2010"/&gt; Future research may also focus on epigenetic changes that mediate the impact of psychotherapy on personality and behaviour.&lt;ref name=Masterpasqua /&gt;

Most epigenetic research is correlational; it merely establishes associations. More experimental research is necessary to help establish causation.&lt;ref name="pmid21908516"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dempster EL, Pidsley R, Schalkwyk LC, Owens S, Georgiades A, Kane F, Kalidindi S, Picchioni M, Kravariti E, Toulopoulou T, Murray RM, Mill J | title = Disease-associated epigenetic changes in monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 20 | issue = 24 | pages = 4786–96 | date = Dec 2011 | pmid = 21908516 | pmc = 3221539 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddr416 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of resources has also limited the number of intergenerational studies.&lt;ref name="Powledge_2011" /&gt; Therefore, advancing longitudinal&lt;ref name="Guo_2010" /&gt; and multigenerational, experience-dependent studies will be critical to further understanding the role of epigenetics in psychology.&lt;ref name="Champagne" /&gt;
