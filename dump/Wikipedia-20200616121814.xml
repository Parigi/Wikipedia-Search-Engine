'''Jared Paul Stern''' (born {{circa}} 1971)&lt;ref name="observer.com"&gt;[http://www.observer.com/node/52833 Age of Jared Paul Stern, per ''The Observer], observer.com; accessed June 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; is an American editor, publisher, photographer, designer and former freelance reporter and columnist for the ''[[New York Post]]'' who gained national notoriety when he was embroiled in a scandal with California billionaire businessman [[Ron Burkle]]. Prior to the event, Stern had written and helped edit the popular "[[Page Six]]" column for 11 years.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Barry, "Gossip Scandal Altering Tabloid", ''Los Angeles Times,'' April 22, 2006, p. A4&lt;/ref&gt;

Stern was a founding editor of ''Page Six'' magazine and wrote the ''New York Post'' columns "Nightcrawler" and Fashion Buzz for several years in addition to editing the Post's Books section. He worked as the Executive Editor of ''[[Star Magazine]]'' with a salary of $300,000 a year, worked at New York magazine twice, and has had work published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[GQ]]'', ''Details'' and ''Spy'' magazines among other publications. He currently edits ''DRIVEN'', an online magazine about cars and style published by [[UrbanDaddy]], owns a clothing line, Skull &amp; Bones, has an antiques store in Maine, Cape Porpoise Outfitters, publishes the Sea Salt dining guide series, works as a freelance photographer and curator, is the literary editor of Room 100 magazine, and contributes to A Continuous Lean.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Born in Philadelphia and raised in Canada after his parent divorced and his mother remarried, Stern is a graduate of [[Bennington College]].

==Burkle scandal==
In April 2006, supermarket magnate and Democratic fundraiser [[Ron Burkle]] released selectively edited transcripts of six minutes of videotape of two face-to-face meetings he had had with Stern the previous month.&lt;ref name="dydn20050421"&gt;"Post Cans Four Gossip Scribes," William Sherman, New York ''Daily News,'' April 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In the sections made available to the media, Stern offered to work for Burkle on a freelance basis for $220,000 a year to help him deal with inaccurate reporting about the billionaire in various gossip columns. Burkle released copies of e-mails from Stern in which Stern allegedly inquires about the status of expected payments. Burkle had previously complained about erroneous stories about himself in the ''Post'' to [[Rupert Murdoch]], his neighbor and owner of the newspaper, in a personal letter, to which Murdoch reportedly never responded.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Stern claims in a series of published interviews that he had been "set up" by Burkle, and was only in meetings with him to discuss a possible investment in his clothing company, Skull &amp; Bones.

The ''Post'' suspended Stern while the video clips were made public, and apparently fired him on April 21, 2006 though he was only working there part time on a freelance basis.&lt;ref name="dydn20050421"/&gt; Criminal charges were never filed against Stern; federal prosecutors deferred to Attorney General [[Alberto Gonzales]], who declined to prosecute.&lt;ref&gt;William Sherman and Leo Standora. "He Quits Page Six Mess - Post-Haste", nydailynews.com, August 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ob20070129"&gt;Choire Sicha, "Ex-Post Keyholer Says He’s Cleared on Extortion Rap", ''New York Observer,'' January 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, 2006, an unnamed source leaked to the press that Stern had landed a contract with [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] to publish a book, tentatively to be called ''Stern Measures'', about the ''Post'', its gossip pages, and various scandals with which he is familiar.&lt;ref&gt;"N.Y. Post's Gossip Guru Lands Book Contract," ''Los Angeles Times,'' October 23, 2006, p.e10&lt;/ref&gt; However, on August 7, 2007, ''Gawker.com'' reported that the book deal did not reach fruition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gawker.com/news/amicable-partings/jared-paul-sterns-book-has-been-cancelled-286902.php "Jared Paul Stern's Book Has Been Cancelled"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929103050/http://gawker.com/news/amicable-partings/jared-paul-sterns-book-has-been-cancelled-286902.php |date=2007-09-29 }}, ''Gawker.com'', August 7, 2007; retrieved 2007-08-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, the [[Associated Press]] ran a story saying that the alleged investigation into Stern had been dropped. Stern later filed a civil lawsuit against not only Burkle, but also Frank Renzi, {{Who|date=June 2015}} Michael Sitrick,{{Who|date=June 2015}} William Sherman,{{Who|date=June 2015}}, ''[[The New York Daily News]]'', [[Hillary Clinton]], and [[Bill Clinton]], claiming libel, emotional distress, interference in business relationship, injurious falsehood, abuse of process, and civil conspiracy.&lt;ref name="ob20070129"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gawker.com/news/jared-paul-stern/jared-paul-stern-suit-best-defendants-ever-246406.php "Jared Paul Stern, Best Defendants Ever"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091325/http://gawker.com/news/jared-paul-stern/jared-paul-stern-suit-best-defendants-ever-246406.php |date=2007-09-29 }}, Gawker.com, March 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/17/jared-paul-sterns-lawsuit_n_107617.html|title=Jared Paul Stern's Lawsuit Against Daily News, Ron Burkle Tossed By New York Judge|first=Adam|last=Goldman|date=June 25, 2008|work=[[Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
