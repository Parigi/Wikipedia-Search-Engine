In [[Ovid]]'s moralizing fable which stands on the periphery of [[Greek mythology]] and [[Roman mythology]], '''Baucis and Philemon''' were an old married couple in the region of [[Tyana]], which Ovid places in [[Phrygia]], and the only ones in their town to welcome disguised gods [[Zeus]] and [[Hermes]] (in Roman mythology, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] respectively), thus embodying the pious exercise of [[hospitality]], the ritualized guest-friendship termed ''[[xenia (Greek)|Xenia]]'', or ''[[theoxenia]]'' when a god was involved.

==Story==
[[Zeus (mythology)|Zeus]] and [[Hermes (mythology)|Hermes]] came disguised as ordinary peasants, and began asking the people of the town for a place to sleep that night. They had been rejected by all, "so wicked were the people of that land," when at last they came to Baucis and Philemon's simple rustic cottage. Though the couple was poor, their generosity far surpassed that of their rich neighbors, among whom the gods found “doors bolted and no word of kindness."

After serving the two guests food and wine (which Ovid depicts with pleasure in the details), Baucis noticed that, although she had refilled her guest's beech wood cups many times, the pitcher was still full (from which derives the phrase "Hermes's Pitcher"). Realizing that her guests were gods, she and her husband "raised their hands in supplication and implored indulgence for their simple home and fare." Philemon thought of catching and killing the goose that guarded their house and making it into a meal, but when he went to do so, it ran to safety in Zeus's lap. Zeus said they need not slay the goose and that they should leave the town. This was because he was going to destroy the town and all those who had turned them away and not provided due [[hospitality]]. He told Baucis and Philemon to climb the mountain with him and Hermes and not to turn back until they reached the top.

After climbing to the summit ("as far as an arrow could shoot in one pull"), Baucis and Philemon looked back on their town and saw that it had been destroyed by a [[flood]] and that Zeus had turned their cottage into an ornate [[temple]]. The couple's wish to be guardians of the temple was granted. They also asked that when time came for one of them to die, that the other would die as well. Upon their death, the couple were changed into an intertwining pair of trees, one [[oak]] and one [[tilia|linden]], standing in the deserted boggy terrain.

==Other versions==
The story of Baucis and Philemon does not appear elsewhere in Greek mythology nor in any [[cult (religion)|cult]], but the notion of hospitality's sacred nature was widespread in the ancient world. After [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] and [[Lot's wife|his wife]] had feasted them, two strangers were revealed as "two [[angel]]s" (Genesis 19:1; the story is in the preceding chapter). Like the story of Baucis and Philemon, Lot and his family were told to flee to the mountains and not look back, before God destroyed the city that he was living in. In addition, Hebrews 13:2 reads "Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing that some have entertained angels without knowing it."

The possibility that unidentified strangers in need of hospitality were gods in disguise was ingrained in first century culture. Less than two generations after Ovid's publication, [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 14:11-12 relates the ecstatic reception given to [[Paul of Tarsus]] and [[Barnabas]] as they ministered in the city of [[Lystra]]: "The crowds shouted 'The gods have come down to us in human form!'  Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes."
