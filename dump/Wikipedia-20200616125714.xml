==Early life and education==


Strickland was born on 27 May 1959, in [[Guelph]], Ontario, Canada to Edith J. ({{née|Ranney}}), an English teacher,&lt;ref name=whirlwind&gt;{{cite news |last1=Booth|first1=Laura |title=Scientist caught in a Nobel whirlwind |url=https://www.therecord.com/news-story/8943888-scientist-caught-in-a-nobel-whirlwind/?s=n1 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |work=[[Waterloo Region Record]] |date=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lloyd Strickland, an electrical engineer.&lt;ref name="Thesis" /&gt; After graduating from Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute, she decided to attend [[McMaster University]] because its [[engineering physics]] program included lasers and [[electro-optics]], areas of particular interest.&lt;ref name="whirlwind" /&gt; At McMaster, she was one of three women in a class of twenty-five. Strickland graduated with a [[Bachelor of Engineering|B.Eng.]] degree in engineering physics in 1981.&lt;ref name="globeandmail"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Semeniuk |first1=Ivan |title=Canada's newest Nobel Prize winner, Donna Strickland, 'just wanted to do something fun' |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-canadian-scientist-donna-strickland-shares-nobel-physics-prize/ |accessdate=3 October 2018 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strickland studied for her graduate degree in [[The Institute of Optics]],&lt;ref name="jewel"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mourou |first=Gérard  |authorlink=Gérard_Mourou |editor1-last=Stroud |editor1-first=Carlos |title=A Jewel in the Crown: 75th Anniversary Essays of The Institute of Optics of the University of Rochester |date=2004 |publisher=Meliora Press |location=Rochester, NY |page=272 |chapter-url=http://www2.optics.rochester.edu/~stroud/BookHTML/ChapVI_pdf/VI_53.pdf |url=http://www2.optics.rochester.edu/~stroud/BookHTML/contents.htm |chapter=53. The dawn of ultrafast science and technology at the University of Rochester |isbn=978-1580461627}}&lt;/ref&gt; receiving a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree from the [[University of Rochester]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="TOS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Biographies – Donna T. Strickland |url=https://www.osa.org/en-us/history/biographies/donna-t-strickland/ |publisher=[[The Optical Society]] |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UWBio"&gt;{{cite web |title=Donna Strickland |url=https://uwaterloo.ca/education-program-for-photonics-professionals/people-profiles/donna-strickland |website=Education Program for Photonics Professionals |publisher=[[University of Waterloo]] |accessdate=2 October 2018 |date=11 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002182312/https://uwaterloo.ca/education-program-for-photonics-professionals/people-profiles/donna-strickland |archive-date=2 October 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
She conducted her doctoral research at the associated [[Laboratory for Laser Energetics]], supervised by [[Gérard Mourou]].&lt;ref name="Valich Rochester"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/rochesters-breakthrough-in-laser-science-earns-nobel-prize-340302/|title=Rochester breakthrough in laser science earns Nobel Prize|last=Valich|first=Lindsey|date=2 October 2018|work=Newscenter|access-date=4 October 2018|publisher=[[University of Rochester]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Strickland and Mourou worked to develop an experimental setup that could raise the peak power of laser pulses, to overcome a limitation, that when the maximal intensity of laser pulses reached gigawatts per square centimetre, [[self-focusing]] of the pulses severely damaged the amplifying part of the laser.
Their 1985 technique of [[chirped pulse amplification]] stretched out each laser pulse both spectrally and in time before amplifying it, then compressed each pulse back to its original duration, generating ultrashort optical pulses of [[terawatt]] to [[petawatt]] intensity.&lt;ref name="Thesis" /&gt;
Using chirped pulse amplification allowed smaller high-power laser systems to be built on a typical laboratory [[optical table]], as "table-top terawatt lasers".&lt;ref name="Valich Rochester" /&gt;
The work received the 2018 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].&lt;ref name="bbc2"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Murphy |first1=Jessica |title=Donna Strickland: The 'laser jock' Nobel prize winner |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45722890 |accessdate=2 October 2018 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and research==
[[File:Ultrafast Laser group.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Strickland's [[ultrafast laser]] group at [[University of Waterloo]], in June 2017]]

From 1988 to 1991, Strickland was a research associate at the [[National Research Council of Canada]], where she worked with [[Paul Corkum]] in the Ultrafast Phenomena Section, which had the distinction at that time of having produced the most powerful short-pulse laser in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24232914/laser_lab_makes_short_work_of_super_beam/|title=Laser lab makes short work of super beam|last=Page|first=Shelley|date=19 October 1990|work=[[Ottawa Citizen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked in the laser division of [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] from 1991 to 1992 and joined the technical staff of [[Princeton University]]'s Advanced Technology Center for Photonics and Opto-electronic Materials in 1992. She joined the [[University of Waterloo]] in 1997 as an [[assistant professor]].&lt;ref name="TOS" /&gt; She became the first full-time female professor in physics at the University of Waterloo.&lt;ref name="Nusca"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nusca |first=Andrew |url=http://fortune.com/2018/10/16/nobel-donna-strickland-women-physics/ |title=Nobel Laureate Donna Strickland: Yes, Women Are Joining Physics. But We've Got Work to Do |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=2018-10-17 |accessdate=2018-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strickland is currently a professor, leading an [[ultrafast laser]] group that develops high-intensity laser systems for nonlinear optics investigations.&lt;ref name="UW" /&gt; She has described herself as a "laser jock":&lt;ref name="bbc2" /&gt;
{{quote|I think it's because we thought we were good with our hands. As an experimentalist,&lt;!-- punctuation corrected --&gt; you need to understand the physics,&lt;!-- punctuation corrected --&gt; but you also need to be able to actually make something work, and the lasers were very finicky in those days.&lt;ref name="whirlwind" /&gt;}}

Strickland's recent work has focused on pushing the boundaries of ultrafast optical science to new [[wavelength]] ranges such as the [[mid-infrared]] and the [[ultraviolet]], using techniques such as two-colour or multi-frequency methods, as well as [[Raman scattering|Raman generation]].&lt;ref name="UW" /&gt; She is also working on the role of high-power lasers in the microcrystalline lens of the human eye, during the process of micromachining of the eye lens to cure [[presbyopia]].&lt;ref name="UW" /&gt;

Strickland became a fellow of [[The Optical Society]]{{efn|Then known as Optical Society of America (OSA).}} in 2008. She served as its vice president and president in 2011 and 2013 respectively, and was a topical editor of its journal ''[[Optics Letters]]'' from 2004 to 2010.&lt;ref name="UW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TOS2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osa.org/en-us/about_osa/newsroom/news_releases/2018/arthur_ashkin_gerard_mourou_and_donna_strickland_a/|title=Arthur Ashkin, Gérard Mourou, and Donna Strickland Awarded 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics|date=2 October 2018|publisher=[[The Optical Society]]|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is currently the chair of The Optical Society's Presidential Advisory Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Standing and Ad Hoc Committees |url=https://www.osa.org/en-us/about_osa/leadership_and_volunteers/committees/standing_ad_hoc_committees/#PAC%7COSA |publisher=[[The Optical Society]] |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a member of and previously served as a board member and Director of Academic Affairs for the [[Canadian Association of Physicists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=News Flash: Canadian physicist, Donna Strickland, co-recipient of 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics |url=https://www.cap.ca/publications/cap-news/2018-nobel-prize-physics/ |website=Canadian Association of Physicists |accessdate=25 October 2018 |date=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McBride |first1=Jason |title=Nobel laureate Donna Strickland: 'I see myself as a scientist, not a woman in science' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/20/nobel-laureate-donna-strickland-i-see-myself-as-a-scientist-not-a-woman-in-science |accessdate=25 October 2018 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strickland had not applied to be a full professor prior to her Nobel prize, but in October 2018, she told the BBC that she had subsequently applied and was promoted to full professorship at the University of Waterloo.&lt;ref name="Professorship"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.therecord.com/news-story/8989043-nobel-laureate-donna-strickland-is-now-full-professor/?s=n1 |title=Nobel laureate Donna Strickland is now full professor |accessdate=27 October 2018 |newspaper=[[Waterloo Region Record]]|date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nobel Prize===
On 2 October 2018, Strickland was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for her work on chirped pulse amplification with her doctoral adviser Gérard Mourou.  [[Arthur Ashkin]] received the other half of the Prize for unrelated work on [[optical tweezers]]. She became the third woman ever to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, after [[Marie Curie]] in 1903 and [[Maria Goeppert Mayer]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="UW" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-45655151 |title=First woman Physics Nobel winner in 55 years |publisher=[[BBC News]] |first=Paul |last=Rincon |date=2 October 2018 |accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strickland and Mourou published their pioneering work "Compression of amplified chirped optical pulses" in 1985, while Strickland was still a doctoral student under Mourou.{{efn|Strickland attempted to add Steve Williamson as an author of the article, but Williamson removed the name as "he hadn't done enough".&lt;ref name="whirlwind" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=15 October 1985 |title=Compression of amplified chirped optical pulses |journal=[[Optics Communications]] |volume=55 |issue=6 |pages=447–449 |doi=10.1016/0030-4018(85)90151-8 |issn=0030-4018 |last1=Strickland |first1=Donna |last2=Mourou |first2=Gerard|citeseerx=10.1.1.673.148 |bibcode=1985OptCo..55..447S }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Their invention of chirped pulse amplification for lasers at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics in Rochester&lt;ref name="Valich Rochester" /&gt; led to the development of the field of high-intensity ultrashort pulses of light beams. Because the ultrabrief and ultrasharp light beams are capable of making extremely precise cuts, the technique is used in [[Laser machining|laser micromachining]], [[laser surgery]], medicine, [[fundamental science]] studies, and other applications. It has enabled doctors to perform millions of corrective [[laser eye surgery|laser eye surgeries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Optical Tweezers' and Tools Used for Laser Eye Surgery Snag Physics Nobel |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/optical-tweezers-and-tools-used-for-laser-eye-surgery-snag-physics-nobel1/ |accessdate=2 October 2018 |work=[[Scientific American]] |date=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that after developing the technique they knew it would be a significant discovery.&lt;ref name="bbc2" /&gt;

When she received the Nobel Prize, many commentators were surprised that she had not reached the rank of full professor. In response, Strickland said that she had "never applied" for a professorship;&lt;ref name="CHE ‘I Never Applied’"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Crowe |first1=Cailin |title='I Never Applied': Nobel Winner Explains Associate-Professor Status, but Critics Still See Steeper Slope for Women |url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/I-Never-Applied-Nobel/244699 |journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |accessdate=7 October 2018|date=2 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "it doesn't carry necessarily a pay raise… I never filled out the paper work… I do what I want to do and that wasn't worth doing."&lt;ref name="whirlwind" /&gt;

===Order of Canada===
