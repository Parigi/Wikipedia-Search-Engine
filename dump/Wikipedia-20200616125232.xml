== Pluralization ==

:''"The best guide clinically for the proper interproximal bony architecture seems to be the &lt;u&gt;interproximal configuration&lt;/u&gt; of the &lt;u&gt;[[cementoenamel junction]]&lt;/u&gt; of the adjacent teeth."''
I recognize that the jargon may throw one off, but should either or both of the underlined nouns be pluralized, seeing how they are anatomical landmarks of the adjacent ''teeth''. '''[[User:DRosenbach|&lt;span style="color:#006400"&gt;DRosenbach&lt;/span&gt;]]''' &lt;sup&gt;([[User_talk:DRosenbach|&lt;span style="color:#006400"&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;]] | [[Special:Contributions/DRosenbach|&lt;span style="color:#006400"&gt;Contribs&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/sup&gt; 01:18, 3 March 2010 (UTC)
:Probably not.  The dentist is presumbaly interested in one particular bit of the bone, which will be characterized by the configuration (singular) of one particular gap (singular) between the (two) teeth adjacent to the bone in question. On the other hand, if the sentence as a whole refers to the entire bone structure of the jaw, it would probably be better as "the interproximal configuration [still singular] of the cementoenamel junctions [plural] of adjacent teeth [no "the"]."

== Russian Runes ==

[[Reforms of Russian orthography|An earlier rune-like and possibly syllabic script was simultaneously discarded, and so thoroughly discouraged that today there are no uncontested specimens of it in existence.]]

What are the contested specimens?[[Special:Contributions/174.3.99.176|174.3.99.176]] ([[User talk:174.3.99.176|talk]]) 01:43, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

:Presumably you are asking about the [[Glagolitic alphabet]]?  [[User:Marco polo|Marco polo]] ([[User talk:Marco polo|talk]]) 03:01, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

:The Glagolitic alphabet is not what would commonly be called "runes".  In the specific sense, the word "runes" refers to the old Germanic ''futhark'' and its offshoots.  In a general sense, the term refers to various writing systems which were used predominantly by scratching or incising a material, so that the letters of such alphabets consist almost entirely of constant-width straight line segments joined by angles (with few or no curves). [[User:AnonMoos|AnonMoos]] ([[User talk:AnonMoos|talk]]) 07:39, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

::Nothing about that sentence applied to Glagolitic, which is a well-known alphabet which is still occasionally used for monuments etc (I saw a modern inscription in Glagolitic script in [[Zagreb]] in 1986 - in the Cathedral, I think). I have never heard of such a script: I wonder if whoever wrote it was thinking of [[Turkic runes]]?
:: If nobody comes forward with any more information I propose that the sentence be deleted from the article. --[[User:ColinFine|ColinFine]] ([[User talk:ColinFine|talk]]) 13:46, 3 March 2010 (UTC)
::::Re: Croatian use of Glaogolitic: indeed, an entire wall in the Zagreb Cathedral is taken up by a gargantuan Glagolitic inscription - quite literally a wall of text :). Glagolitic is also featured on the 100 Croatian kuna banknote - our article informs me that the inscription on the banknote is from the [[Baška tablet]]. Glagolitic is far from completely out of documented existence. [[User:TomorrowTime|TomorrowTime]] ([[User talk:TomorrowTime|talk]]) 08:31, 5 March 2010 (UTC)

== how offensive is the word "Paki" in UK compared to "nigger" in USA? ==

I was on facebook and it look like South Asians embrace the term... perhaps ironically?  I am confused.  Either way, I won't go around calling people "paki" but I would love to know just how naughty it is in the spectrum of racial slurs.----
&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class="autosigned"&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back|The Fat Man Who Never Came Back]] ([[User talk:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/The Fat Man Who Never Came Back|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:It is generally considered highly offensive in the UK - [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article5496878.ece this article] provides some useful background, and there was widespread outrage when [[Prince Harry]] used the word - [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/theroyalfamily/4216808/Prince-Harrys-Paki-comments-completely-unacceptable-says-David-Cameron.html see this].   Historically (back to the 1950s or so) the word was always used in a derogatory sense. It may be true that some people of Asian origin now embrace the term within their own community - but in general use it is always offensive.  [[User:Ghmyrtle|Ghmyrtle]] ([[User talk:Ghmyrtle|talk]]) 08:06, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

::Agreed, both that it is highly offensive, and that it is being reclaimed. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' says it is "slang (usu. derogatory and offensive). orig. and chiefly Brit."  The earliest citation is 1964, and I would categorise that example sentence as dismissive rather than overtly hostile. To what extent it has become a [[reclaimed word]] within the community to which it refers, that is another question. A couple of the OED citations stand out:
:::1987 [[Verbatim (magazine)|Verbatim]] Summer 10/2 As for truncation, Aussie, Argie, and Paki range in Britain from good-humored mockery to outright contempt. 
:::2002 C. NEWLAND Snakeskin xxii. 297 We beat up kids around our area. You know, all the Pakis and coons that live around here, we used to chase 'em an' kick shit out of 'em.
:::1997 [[Hanif Kureishi|H. KUREISHI]] Love in Blue Time 69 What a job it is, walking round in this Paki gear!
::Courtia Newland is described by her publishers as a young Black British writer; it matters who is allowed to use words like these. And then there is the related term for [[corner shop]]:
:::Paki shop n. a corner shop owned or staffed by a person of Pakistani or South Asian birth or descent.
:::1983 I. RICHARD We, British 44 The ‘*Paki-shop’ -- misnamed because most of them were owned, not by Pakistanis, but by Indians from East Africa -- appeared to fulfill a vital service. 
:::2000 R. FERNANDEZ America's Banquet of Cultures vii. 202 Allegedly, a company executive told [him]..to use a van ‘parked outside the Paki shop’.
::I have found some discussions about the use of the word: at ''The Asian News'' [http://www.theasiannews.co.uk/news/s/520/520366_paki_word_or_insult.html here], on the BBC [[Bradford]] pages [http://www.bbc.co.uk/bradford/features/2005/03/paki.shtml here], and Asiana [http://www.asianamag.com/Article/ArticleDetails.aspx?URLPrefix=Lifestyle&amp;MasterPageSectionURLName=IssuesAndAdvice&amp;ArticleCategory=IssuesAndAdvice&amp;ArticleID=31 here].

== "how to use ..." in Chinese ==

If a person was going to teach someone to use something, like a computer for instance, would it look like this?

我教朋友能电脑。

--[[User:Ghostexorcist|Ghostexorcist]] ([[User talk:Ghostexorcist|talk]]) 02:21, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

:No, it wouldn't. 能 is a word for "can", as such, so it's not appropriate. You would use it in

: 我朋友能用电脑。&lt;br/&gt;
:My friend can use (the) computer.

:So in your case, you mean

:我教朋友用电脑。

:用 is use, generally. But Chinese has different verbs for different subjects, so... 

:(Note: I speak Singaporean Chinese, so this may not be entirely correct. But it should be.) &lt;span style="font-family:Tahoma"&gt;[[User:Singlish_speaker|&lt;font color="#CC0099"&gt;'''SS'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;[[Special:EmailUser/Singlish_speaker|✞]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Singlish_speaker|&lt;font color="teal"&gt;(Kay)&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:05, 3 March 2010 (UTC)
::Mainland Mandarin is roughly the same as this. Your first example is a bit different, though; in standard Mandarin 会 would be used there instead of 能 (会 means to be able to do something as in 'possess the skills and technical ability', whereas 能 is more like to have permission and be in the right circumstances). &lt;b class="IPA"&gt;[[User:Rjanag|r&lt;font color="#8B0000"&gt;ʨ&lt;/font&gt;anaɢ]]&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Rjanag|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Rjanag|contribs]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 05:11, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

== Between a rock and a hard place ==

A recent question on the Misc desk included a reference to the phrase "[[Between a rock and a hard place]]", which in fact redirects to our article for "dilemma". I've never understood that phrase to refer to a dilemma (i.e. a choice between hitting a rock and some other hard thing), but simply a metaphor of being crushed, as on a [[millstone]] - to be "in a tight spot" as it were. Am I using the phrase incorrectly or is our article? If the article use is "correct", I'd have to say that the meaning has now spread to encompass the meaning I've been exposed to. [[User:Matt Deres|Matt Deres]] ([[User talk:Matt Deres|talk]]) 02:36, 3 March 2010 (UTC)
:I hear the phrase most often used to mean "I have to choose between two things, and neither is ideal." I'd think that is more closely related to "dilemma". Indeed, the Wiktionary entry ([[:wikt:between a rock and a hard place|between a rock and a hard place]]) lists "to [[:wikt:be on the horns of a dilemma|be on the horns of a dilemma]]" as a synonym. [[User:Xenon54|Xenon54]] / [[User talk:Xenon54|talk]] / 02:56, 3 March 2010 (UTC)
::Yep, I always think of it along similar line as "damned if you do, damned if you don't". When you're stuck in a bad situation and there's not a thing you can do about it. &lt;b class="IPA"&gt;[[User:Rjanag|r&lt;font color="#8B0000"&gt;ʨ&lt;/font&gt;anaɢ]]&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Rjanag|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Rjanag|contribs]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 03:00, 3 March 2010 (UTC)
:::But your second sentence agrees with ''my'' definition, right? Getting stuck in a bad situation isn't synonymous with having having two choices of which neither are good. Being stuck in a situation means you have no room for choices anymore... at least, that's how I'd read it. [[User:Matt Deres|Matt Deres]] ([[User talk:Matt Deres|talk]]) 04:05, 3 March 2010 (UTC)
:I always understood it to be synonymous with "[[between the devil and the deep blue sea]]", or "between [[Scylla and Charybdis]]". They are all metaphors for only having two choices, where both choices will kill you.

::But being between the devil and the deep blue sea isn't a choice, it's a hard to access place on a ship - again, a "tight spot" as it were, not a dilemma. I realize this bit is just my personal preference, but it would be nice if the Scylla and Charybdis metaphor would be used to only describe a situation like in the original story - on the one hand possible total disaster and on the other hand almost certain, but lesser, loss. On the other (third?) hand, I have an inkling that no person living today has ever used the phrase "I feel as though I'm caught between Scylla and Charybdis!" at all.

:''Calem'' might by a misspelling of ''całem'' which is an older spelling of ''całym''. It would have been raher antiquated by the 1970s in Poland, but perhaps archaic forms survived longer among Polish Americans. Or perhaps it's a literal translation of "with every inch", ''każdym calem'', but this would be unidiomatic in Polish, and ''calem sercem'' is simply ungrammatical.

:::The English phrase “fierce and dark like a heap of collyrium” is attributed in the article to the Garuda Purana (2.5.147-149) which is a Sanskrit text.  I don’t have a copy of the text on hand, but the concept translated as “collyrium” is a common image.  Sanskrit words for “collyrium” are listed in Apte's "The Student's English-Sanskrit Dictionary" p. 64.  Three alternatives are given. अंजनं (añjanaṁ) in general refers to an ointment, but specifically it is a type of cosmetic used to blacken the eyelashes.  Chemical composition is pulverized [[antimony]], and the use of [[antimony]] as a cosmetic is mentioned in the Wikipedia article for that substance (Macdonell’s “A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary”, p. 5). कज्जलं (kajjalaṁ) is lamp-black, and collyrium is prepared from it (Macdonell, p. 61). नेत्ररंजनं (netrañjanaṁ) is eye-salve (netra means eye) (Macdonell, p. 147).

:::So the word that is probably used in the original text was either añjanaṁ or kajjalaṁ, both of which are black types of netrañjanaṁ.  Yama is associated with the color black, so the image of blackness is intended.  I have noticed the use of the English word collyrium in translations of other texts that use it in the sense of a medicinal eye-salve (as opposed to a cosmetic) but in a different context.  The condition of being unable to see the reality of the world around us is sometimes compared to the medical problem of a partially-blind person or someone with vision trouble.  The use of eye-salves for medicinal purposes to improve sight is used as an analogy for the use of spiritual study to help remove weakness of inner sight.  The specific medical condition sometimes mentioned for this analogy is तिमिरं (timiraṁ) which means “darkened” or “clouded”eyesight. So the association with darkness is present even in that use, but indirectly. [[User:Buddhipriya|Buddhipriya]] ([[User talk:Buddhipriya|talk]]) 00:57, 4 March 2010 (UTC)

:I remember getting a chuckle from some magazine article claiming paleo-linguists had determined that the first word was ''tik'' and that it meant "finger".  [[Proto-Human language]] actually says some things about this topic.  Unfortunately, no written documentation from before the development of language seems to have survived. ;-) [[Special:Contributions/75.62.109.146|75.62.109.146]] ([[User talk:75.62.109.146|talk]]) 00:24, 4 March 2010 (UTC)

:Given that the word for "mother" in nearly every language on earth is some variant on "ma", one could make a case for that one.

:It isn't really a word if there aren't any other words, it's just a sound. What makes a sound a word is that it is part of a particular language and you can't have a meaningful language of one word. --[[User:Tango|Tango]] ([[User talk:Tango|talk]]) 05:31, 4 March 2010 (UTC)
::Not necessarily.

:::There was a ''Far Side'' joke that a scientist had a machine that figured out what dogs are saying when they're barking at each other. Turns out what they're saying is, "Hey!" So from the "near" side, you might be onto something. Assuming the OP considers "Hey!" to be a word, whatever a caveman might have said for "Hey!" could qualify. ←[[User:Baseball Bugs|Baseball Bugs]] &lt;sup&gt;''[[User talk:Baseball Bugs|What's up, Doc?]]''&lt;/sup&gt; [[Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs|carrots]]→ 12:24, 4 March 2010 (UTC)
