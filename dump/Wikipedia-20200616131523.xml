== Early life ==
Branagh, the middle of three children, was born in [[Belfast]], the son of [[working class]] [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant]] parents Frances (''née'' Harper) and William Branagh, a [[plumber]] and [[Woodworking joints|joiner]] who ran a company that specialised in fitting partitions and suspended ceilings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/entertainment/film/biographies/kenneth_branagh_biog.html |title=Kenneth Branagh Biography |publisher=Tiscali.co.uk |date= |accessdate=7 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927054756/http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entertainment/film/biography/artist/kenneth-branagh/biography/71 |archivedate=27 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in the [[Shore Road, Belfast|Tigers Bay]] area of the city&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/kenneth-branagh-i-left-belfast-but-its-still-my-home-and-id-love-to-shoot-a-movie-here-34753092.html|title=Kenneth Branagh: I left Belfast but it's still my home and I'd love to shoot a movie here |publisher=Belfast Telegraph |date= |accessdate=16 July 2018|newspaper=Belfasttelegraph.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was educated at Grove Primary School.&lt;ref&gt;White, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended the amateur Reading Cine &amp; Video Society (now called Reading Film &amp; Video Makers)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readingfilmandvideomakers.org.uk |title=RFVM History 1957–2012|publisher=Reading Film &amp; Video Makers}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a member and was a keen member of [[Progress Theatre]] of which he is now the patron.

== Career ==

=== Theatre ===
Branagh achieved some early measure of success in his native Northern Ireland for his role as Billy, the title character in the BBC's ''[[Play for Today]]''&lt;ref&gt;White p.17&lt;/ref&gt; trilogy known as the ''Billy Plays'' (1982–84), written by [[Graham Reid (writer)|Graham Reid]] and set in Belfast.

He received acclaim in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] for his stage performances, first winning the 1982 [[Laurence Olivier Award|SWET]] Award for Best Newcomer, for his role as Judd in [[Julian Mitchell]]'s ''[[Another Country (play)|Another Country]]'', after leaving [[RADA]]. Branagh was part of the 'new wave' of actors to emerge from the Academy. Others included [[Jonathan Pryce]], [[Juliet Stevenson]], [[Alan Rickman]], [[Anton Lesser]], [[Bruce Payne]] and [[Fiona Shaw]]. In 1984 he appeared in the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] production of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', directed by [[Adrian Noble]]. The production played to sold-out audiences, especially at the [[Barbican Centre|Barbican]] in the [[City of London]]. It was this production that he adapted for the film version of the play in 1989. He and [[David Parfitt]] founded the [[Renaissance Theatre Company]] in 1987, following success with several productions on the London 'Fringe', including Branagh's full-scale production of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' at the [[Lyric Theatre (Hammersmith)|Lyric Studio]], co-starring with [[Samantha Bond]]. The first major Renaissance production was Branagh's Christmas 1987 staging of ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' at [[Riverside Studios]] in [[Hammersmith]], starring [[Richard Briers]] as [[Malvolio]] and [[Frances Barber]] as Viola, and with an original score by actor, musician and composer [[Patrick Doyle]], who two years later was to compose the music for Branagh's film adaptation of ''[[Henry V (1989 film)|Henry V]]''. This ''Twelfth Night'' was later adapted for television.

Branagh became a major presence in the media and on the British stage when Renaissance collaborated with [[Birmingham Rep]] for a 1988 touring season of three Shakespeare plays under the umbrella title of ''Renaissance Shakespeare on the Road'', which also played a repertory season at the [[Phoenix Theatre (London)|Phoenix Theatre]] in London. It featured directorial debuts for [[Judi Dench]] with ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' (starring Branagh and Samantha Bond &lt;!-- Please do not change this to E Thompson. If you read the section header this is about a stage version of the play not the film. That came later --&gt; as Benedick and Beatrice), [[Geraldine McEwan]] with ''[[As You Like It]]'', and [[Derek Jacobi]] directing Branagh in the title role in ''[[Hamlet]]'', with [[Sophie Thompson]]&lt;!-- Please do not change this to K Winslet. If you read the section header this is about a stage version of the play not the film. That came later --&gt; as [[Ophelia]]. Critic [[Milton Shulman]] of the London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' wrote: "On the positive side Branagh has the vitality of [[Laurence Olivier|Olivier]], the passion of [[John Gielgud|Gielgud]], the assurance of [[Alec Guinness|Guinness]], to mention but three famous actors who have essayed the role. On the negative side, he has not got the magnetism of Olivier, nor the mellifluous voice quality of Gielgud nor the intelligence of Guinness."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The London Stage in the 20th Century'' by [[Robert Tanitch]], Haus (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later in 1989 Branagh co-starred with [[Emma Thompson]] in the Renaissance revival of ''[[Look Back in Anger]]''. Judi Dench directed both the theatre and television productions, presented first in [[Belfast]] then at the [[London Coliseum]] and [[Lyric Theatre, London|Lyric Theatre]].

In 1990, he wrote his autobiography ''Beginning'', recounting his life and acting career up to that point. In the book's introduction, he admits that the main reason for producing the book was "money" -- "The deal was made, and a handsome advance was paid out. The advance provided the funds to buy accommodation for the Company's offices, this moving Renaissance out of my flast and bringing me a little closer to sanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Branagh, Kenneth|title=Beginning|date=1990|publisher=Norton|isbn=0-393-02862-3|edition=1st American|location=New York|pages=ix|oclc=20669813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Branagh starred at the [[Crucible Theatre]], [[Sheffield]] as [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]. In 2003 he starred in the [[Royal National Theatre]]'s production of [[David Mamet]]'s ''[[Edmond (play)|Edmond]]''. Branagh directed ''[[The Play What I Wrote]]'' in England in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4725734/Branagh-ready-for-the-next-stage.html |title=Branagh ready for the next stage |newspaper=Telegraph |date= 24 September 2001|accessdate=7 March 2010 | location=London |first=Graeme |last=Archer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and directed a Broadway production in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curtainup.com/playwhatiwrote.html |title=The Play What I Wrote, a CurtainUp London and New York review |publisher=Curtainup.com |date= |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkinbroadway.com/world/PlayWhat.html |title=Talkin' Broadway Review: The Play What I Wrote |publisher=Talkinbroadway.com |date=30 March 2003 |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From September to November 2008, Branagh appeared at [[Wyndham's Theatre]] as the title character in the [[Donmar Warehouse|Donmar West End]] revival of [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'' in a new version by [[Tom Stoppard]]. His performance was lauded as the "performance of the year" by several critics.&lt;ref&gt;Staff writer (18 September 2008).

In July 2013 he co-directed ''[[Macbeth]]'' at [[Manchester International Festival]] with [[Rob Ashford]]. With Branagh in the title role, [[Alex Kingston]] played Lady Macbeth and [[Ray Fearon]] featured as Macduff. The final performance of the completely sold-out run, was broadcast to cinemas on 20 July as part of [[National Theatre Live]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mif.co.uk/event/macbeth |title=Kenneth Branagh and Alex Kingston MACBETH Directed by Rob Ashford and Kenneth Branagh |publisher=Mif.co.uk |date= |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated his performance and directorial duties opposite Ashford and Kingston when the production moved to [[New York City]]'s [[Seventh Regiment Armory|Park Avenue Armory]] in June 2014.

In April 2015, Branagh announced his formation of the Kenneth Branagh Theatre Company, in which he would appear as [[actor-manager]].
