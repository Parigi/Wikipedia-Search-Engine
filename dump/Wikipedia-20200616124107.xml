"'''Treble Cross'''" is the 24th episode of ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'', a British [[Supermarionation]] television series created by [[Gerry Anderson|Gerry]] and [[Sylvia Anderson]] and produced by their company [[AP Films#Century 21|Century 21 Productions]]. Written by [[Tony Barwick]] and directed by Alan Perry, it was first broadcast on 23 February 1968 on [[ATV Midlands]].

In this episode, [[Captain Black (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Black]] engineers the death and reconstruction of a [[test pilot]] as part of a plot to destroy the [[World government in fiction|world capital]], Futura City. However, his victim is revived in hospital and with Spectrum's help impersonates his [[Mysteron]] replacement in a bid to trap Black.

==Plot==
World Air Force [[test pilot]] Major Gravener is being driven to Slaton Airbase by car when [[Captain Black (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Black]], approaching from the opposite direction in a truck, extends a beam with false headlamps into the road to dazzle Gravener's chauffeur, Harris. Fearing a collision, Harris swerves the car into a lake and both he and Gravener drown. The [[clinically-dead]] Gravener is discovered by two passing doctors and taken to Slaton Hospital, where he is revived with the aid of a stasis and recovery unit.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley2001,82"&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, a [[Mysteron]] reconstruction of Gravener travels to Slaton Airbase and commandeers an XK-107 bomber armed with a [[nuclear warhead]]. When word reaches the base of Gravener's accident, the personnel realise that the pilot is an impostor and block the runway just as he is taking off. The XK-107 crashes and explodes, killing the reconstructed Gravener. Spectrum connects the attempted theft of the XK-107 to a Mysteron threat to destroy the [[World government in fiction|world capital]], Futura City.

Briefed by Captains [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Scarlet]] and [[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Blue]] (voiced by [[Francis Matthews (actor)|Francis Matthews]] and [[Ed Bishop]]), the original Gravener leaves in a second XK-107 in an attempt to impersonate his Mysteron reconstruction. As hoped, Captain Black (voiced by [[Donald Gray]]) telepathically contacts the aircraft: he instructs Gravener to land 30 miles outside Futura City at the disused Weston Airstrip, where his truck is shown to be waiting. Scarlet deduces that the purpose of the rendezvous was to transfer the warhead to a road vehicle, after which Gravener's reconstruction was to have continued flying the XK-107 as a decoy while the warhead was driven into Futura City and detonated.

Spectrum ground forces, led by Scarlet and Blue in a [[Spectrum Patrol Car]], converge on the airstrip to capture Black. The truck attempts to escape but crashes into a bunker, killing its driver. However, Scarlet, Blue and the newly arrived Gravener are shocked to find that this man is not Black, but a Mysteron reconstruction of Harris.&lt;ref name="Bentley2001,82"/&gt; Although the Mysterons were unable to distinguish between the two Graveners, Black's "[[Extrasensory perception|sixth sense]]" has enabled him to evade Spectrum once again.

==Production==
"Treble Cross" was filmed over two weeks in September 1967, during which time Century 21's next Supermarionation series, ''[[Joe 90]]'', entered [[pre-production]].&lt;ref name="Bentley2017"/&gt;

The [[scale model]] representing Slaton Hospital previously appeared as the microbiological laboratory in "[[Place of Angels]]".&lt;ref name="Bentley2017"/&gt; For realism, during the filming of the revival scenes the front of the Major Gravener puppet was fitted with an air bag to make it appear that the character's chest is rising and falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Drake|first1=Chris|last2=Bassett|first2=Graeme|title=Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons|date=1993|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Boxtree]]|location=London, UK|isbn=978-1-85283-403-6|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Footage showing the Spectrum forces converging on Weston Airstrip is duplicated from "[[Manhunt (Captain Scarlet)|Manhunt]]", another episode in which Spectrum attempts to apprehend [[Captain Black (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Black]].&lt;ref name="Bentley2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley2001,82"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley2008"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bentley|first1=Chris|title=The Complete Gerry Anderson: The Authorised Episode Guide|edition=4th|year=2008|origyear=2001|publisher=Reynolds &amp; Hearn|location=London, UK|isbn=978-1-905287-74-1|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Treble Cross" is one of several ''Captain Scarlet'' episodes written by [[Tony Barwick]] to include a mention of [[10 July]].&lt;ref name="Bentley2001,82"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley2008"/&gt; Barwick liked to insert references to this date as it was his birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=''Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons'': By Numbers|last1=Pixley|first1=Andrew|last2=Rogers|first2=Julie|editor1-last=Gillatt|editor1-first=Gary|magazine=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]|issue=280|date=December 2001|publication-date=November 2001|publisher=[[Visual Imagination]]|location=London, UK|issn=0955-114X|oclc=79615651|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Anthony Clark of ''sci-fi-online.com'' considers this episode's premise "more interesting" than that of "[[Fire at Rig 15]]" but describes "Treble Cross" overall as "a little slow".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sci-fi-online.com/reviews/video/12-12_scarlet6.htm|title=''Captain Scarlet'': Volume 6 – Video Review|last1=Clark|first1=Anthony|work=sci-fi-online.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012011044/http://sci-fi-online.com/reviews/video/12-12_scarlet6.htm|archivedate=12 October 2011|url-status=live|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shane M. Dallmann of ''[[Video Watchdog]]'' magazine calls it "less amusing but far more intelligent" than "[[Flight to Atlantica]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|magazine=[[Video Watchdog]]|last1=Dallmann|first1=Shane M.|title=DVD Spotlight: ''Captain Scarlet''|issue=96|date=June 2003|editor1-last=Lucas|editor1-first=Tim|editor1-link=Tim Lucas|publisher=Tim and Donna Lucas|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|issn=1070-9991|oclc=646838004|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media historian [[Nicholas J. Cull]] believes "Treble Cross" to be one of several ''Captain Scarlet'' episodes that demonstrate writer [[Tony Barwick]]'s interest in the dangers of [[nuclear technology]]. He regards the plot involving the attempted theft of a nuclear warhead as an example of Barwick re-using his "favourite [[Plot device|device]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cull|first1=Nicholas J.|authorlink=Nicholas J.
