The '''''New York Post''''' (sometimes abbreviated as '''''NY Post''''') is a [[daily newspaper]] in New York City. The ''Post'' also operates the celebrity gossip site PageSix.com and the entertainment site Decider.com, and co-produces the television show ''Page Six TV''.

The modern version of the paper is published in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid format]]. Established in 1801 by [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] [[Alexander Hamilton]], it became a respected [[broadsheet]] in the 19th century, under the name '''''New York Evening Post'''''.

In 1976, [[Rupert Murdoch]] bought the ''Post'' for US$30.5 million.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter2005"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001479107 |title=News Corp: Historical Overview |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=November 14, 2005 |access-date=June 7, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208130444/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001479107 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archive-date=December 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1993, the ''Post'' has been owned by [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]] and its successor, [[News Corp (2013–present)|News Corp]], which had owned it previously from 1976 to 1988.

== History ==
The ''New York Post'', established on November 16, 1801, as the ''New-York Evening Post'', describes itself as the nation's oldest continuously published ''daily'' newspaper. ''[[The Providence Journal]]'', which began daily publication on July 21, 1829, also bills itself as the nation's oldest continuously published daily newspaper because the ''New York Post'' halted publication during strikes in 1958 and 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.projo.com/cgi-bin/include.pl/extra/2004/175/content/175old.htm|title=Digital Extra: The Journal's 175th Anniversary - For the record|last=The Providence Journal Co.|date=July 21, 2004|access-date=August 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622075034/http://www.projo.com/cgi-bin/include.pl/extra/2004/175/content/175old.htm|archive-date=June 22, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hartford Courant]]'', believed to be the oldest continuously published newspaper, was founded in 1764 as a semi-weekly paper; it did not publish daily until 1836. ''[[The New Hampshire Gazette]]'', which has trademarked its claim of being ''The Nation's Oldest Newspaper'', was founded in 1756 as a weekly. Since the 1890s it has been published only on weekends.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

===19th century===

The ''Post'' was founded by [[Alexander Hamilton]] with about US$10,000 from a group of investors in the autumn of 1801 as the ''New-York Evening Post'',&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins, ''The Evening Post: Century of Journalism'', Boni and Liveright, 1922, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[broadsheet]]. Hamilton's co-investors included other New York members of the [[Federalist Party]], such as [[Robert Troup]] and [[Oliver Wolcott]],&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; who were dismayed by the election of [[Thomas Jefferson]] as U.S. President and the rise in popularity of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]].&lt;ref name=Emery_opcit&gt;Emery &amp; Emery, page 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting at which Hamilton first recruited investors for the new paper took place in the then-country weekend [[villa]] that is now [[Gracie Mansion]].&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, pages 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton chose [[William Coleman (editor)|William Coleman]] as his first editor.&lt;ref name=Emery_opcit/&gt;
[[File:William Cullen Bryant.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|[[William Cullen Bryant]], the ''Post''{{'}}s most famous 19th-century editor]]
The most famous 19th-century ''Evening Post'' editor was the poet and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[William Cullen Bryant]].&lt;ref&gt;Emery &amp; Emery, page 90.&lt;/ref&gt; So well respected was the ''Evening Post'' under Bryant's editorship, it received praise from the English philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]], in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, page 341.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1829, Bryant invited [[William Leggett (writer)|William Leggett]], the [[Locofoco]] Democrat, to write for the paper. There, in addition to literary and drama reviews, Leggett began to write political editorials. Leggett's espoused a fierce opposition to [[central banking]] and support for the organization of labor unions. He was a member of the [[Equal Rights Party (United States)|Equal Rights Party]]. Leggett became a co-owner and editor at the ''Post'' in 1831,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} eventually working as sole editor of the newspaper while Bryant traveled in Europe in 1834 through 1835.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Beckner |first1=Steve |title=Leggett |url=https://reason.com/1977/02/01/leggett/ |website=reason.com |publisher=Reason Foundation |accessdate=19 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another co-owner of the paper was [[John Bigelow]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Bigelow|title=John Bigelow {{!}} American diplomat|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-05-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502164925/https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Bigelow|archive-date=May 2, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in Malden-on-Hudson, New York, John Bigelow, Sr. graduated in 1835 from Union College, where he was a member of the [[Sigma Phi]] Society and the Philomathean Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://schaffer.union.edu/bigelow/johnbigelow.html|title=Bigelow Correspondence Database - John Bigelow|website=schaffer.union.edu|access-date=2019-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was admitted to the bar in 1838.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From 1849 to 1861, he was one of the editors and co-owners of the ''Evening Post''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1881 [[Henry Villard]] took control of the ''Evening Post'', as well as ''[[The Nation]]'', which became the ''Post''{{'}}s weekly edition. With this acquisition, the paper was managed by the triumvirate of [[Carl Schurz]], [[Horace White (writer)|Horace White]], and [[Edwin Lawrence Godkin|Edwin L. Godkin]].&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, page 438.&lt;/ref&gt; When Schurz left the paper in 1883, Godkin became editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, page 458.&lt;/ref&gt; White became editor-in-chief in 1899, and remained in that role until his retirement in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E00E1D71F31E733A05754C1A96F9C946796D6CF Horace White Dies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192338/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E00E1D71F31E733A05754C1A96F9C946796D6CF |date=March 3, 2016 }}," ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 17, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, pp. 440–441.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, both publications passed to the management of Villard's son, [[Oswald Garrison Villard]],&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Biographical Dictionary'', G. &amp; C. Miriam Co., 1964, page 1522.&lt;/ref&gt; a founding member of both the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]]&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Robert Reed, ''The Chicago NAACP and the Rise of Black Professional Leadership, 1910–1966'', Indiana University Press, 1997, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Emery &amp; Emery, page 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1918 to 1976===
Villard sold the paper in 1918, after widespread allegations of pro-German sympathies during [[World War I]] hurt its circulation. The new owner was [[Thomas W. Lamont|Thomas Lamont]], a senior partner in the [[Wall Street]] firm of [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.]]. Unable to stem the paper's financial losses, he sold it to a [[consortium]] of 34 financial and reform political leaders, headed by [[Edwin Francis Gay]], dean of the [[Harvard Business School]], whose members included [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]].

In 1934, [[J. David Stern]] purchased the paper, changed its name to the ''New York Post'',&lt;ref name=ketupa/&gt; and restored its broadsheet size and liberal perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Emery &amp; Emery, page 292.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, [[Dorothy Schiff]] purchased the paper. Her husband, George Backer, was named editor and publisher.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah G. Felder &amp; Diana L. Rosen, ''Fifty Jewish Women Who Changed the World'', Citadel Press, 2003, page 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Her second editor (and third husband) [[Ted Thackrey]] became co-publisher and co-editor with Schiff in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,794542,00.html|title=Dolly's Goodbye| work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= January 31, 1949|accessdate=June 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they recast the newspaper into its current tabloid format.&lt;ref&gt;Emery &amp; Emery, page 556.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948 ''[[The Bronx Home News]]'' merged with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.landsofnewyork.com/County-Data-For-Bronx-County-New-York |title=County Data for Bronx County, New York |publisher=LandsofNewYork.com |accessdate=February 13, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201194358/http://www.landsofnewyork.com/County-Data-For-Bronx-County-New-York |archive-date=February 1, 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, [[James Wechsler]] became editor of the paper, running both the news and the editorial pages. In 1961, he turned over the news section to [[Paul Sann]] and stayed on as editorial page editor until 1980.

Under Schiff's tenure the ''Post'' was devoted to liberalism, supporting trade unions and social welfare, and featured some of the most popular columnists of the time, such as [[Joseph Cookman]], [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Max Lerner]], [[Murray Kempton]], [[Pete Hamill]], and [[Eric Sevareid]], in addition to theatre critic [[Richard Watts, Jr.]] and [[gossip]] [[columnist]] [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]].

===Murdoch ownership===
In November 1976, it was announced that Australian [[Rupert Murdoch]] had bought the ''Post'' from Schiff with the intention she would remain as a consultant for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carmody|first=Deirdre|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/11/20/archives/new-jersey-pages-dorothy-schiff-agrees-to-sell-post-to-murdoch.html|title=Dorothy Schiff Agrees to Sell ''Post'' To Murdoch, Australian Publisher|work=The New York Times|date=November 20, 1976|accessdate=December 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230230317/http://www.nytimes.com/1976/11/20/archives/new-jersey-pages-dorothy-schiff-agrees-to-sell-post-to-murdoch.html|archive-date=December 30, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later emerged that Murdoch bought the newspaper for US$30.5 million.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter2005"/&gt; The ''Post'' at this point was the only surviving afternoon daily in New York City and its circulation under Schiff had grown by two-thirds, particularly after the failure of the competing ''[[New York World Journal Tribune|World Journal Tribune]]''. However, the rising cost of operating an afternoon daily in a city with worsening daytime traffic congestion, combined with mounting competition from expanded local radio and TV news cut into the ''Post''{{'}}s profitability, though it made money from 1949 until Schiff's final year of ownership, when it lost $500,000. The paper has lost money ever since.&lt;ref name=Emery_opcit/&gt;

In late October 1995, the ''Post'' announced plans to change its Monday through Saturday publication schedule and begin issuing a Sunday edition,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |date=October 24, 1995 |title=New York Post to Publish on Sundays |work=New York Times |page= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/24/nyregion/new-york-post-to-publish-on-sundays.html |accessdate=December 8, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221000037/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/24/nyregion/new-york-post-to-publish-on-sundays.html |archive-date=December 21, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; which it last published briefly in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |date=February 5, 1996 |title=Post Plans Sunday Paper |work=New York Times |page=6 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/05/nyregion/post-plans-sunday-paper.html |accessdate=December 8, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221000046/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/05/nyregion/post-plans-sunday-paper.html |archive-date=December 21, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 14, 1996, the ''Post'' delivered its new Sunday edition at the cost of 50 cents per paper by keeping its size to 120 pages.&lt;ref name="Orlando"&gt;{{Citation |date=April 14, 1996 |title=The New York Post Starts Inexpensive Sunday Paper |publisher=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |page=A26 |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/keyword/new-york-post/recent/2 |accessdate=December 8, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214064752/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/keyword/new-york-post/recent/2 |archive-date=December 14, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount, significantly less than Sunday editions from ''The Daily News'' and ''The New York Times'', was part of ''Post''{{'}}s efforts "to find a niche in the nation's most competitive newspaper market".&lt;ref name="Orlando"/&gt;

In December 2012, Murdoch announced that Jesse Angelo had been appointed publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newscorp.com/news/news_549.html|title=News Corporation Announces Intent to Pursue Separation of Businesses to Enhance Strategic Alignment and Increase Operational Flexibility|publisher=News Corp|location=New York, NY|date=June 28, 2012|access-date=March 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527091629/http://www.newscorp.com/news/news_549.html|archive-date=May 27, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NYPost.jpg|thumb|upright|right|One of the paper's most famous headlines, from the edition of April 15, 1983]]

Murdoch imported the tabloid journalism style of many of his Australian and British newspapers, such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', which remains one of the highest selling daily newspapers in the UK. This style was typified by the ''Post''{{'}}s famous headlines such as "Headless body in topless bar" (shown on the right, written by [[Vincent Musetto]]).

Because of the institution of federal regulations limiting media [[cross ownership|cross-ownership]] after Murdoch's purchase of WNEW-TV (now [[WNYW]]) and four other stations from [[Metromedia]] to launch the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], Murdoch was forced to sell the paper for $37.6 million in 1988 to [[Peter S.

Various branches of Murdoch's media groups, [[21st Century Fox]]'s [[Endemol Shine North America]] and [[News Corp (2013–present)|News Corp]]' New York Post created a ''Page Six TV'' nightly gossip show based and named after the Post's gossip section.

==Criticism==
The ''Post'' has been criticized since the beginning of Murdoch's ownership for [[sensationalism]], blatant [[advocacy]], and conservative [[Media bias|bias]]. In 1980, the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' stated "''New York Post'' is no longer merely a journalistic problem. It is a social problem – a force for evil."&lt;ref name="CJR"&gt;''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', volume 18, number 5 (Jan/Feb 1980), p. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most serious allegation against the ''Post'' is that it is willing to contort its news coverage to suit Murdoch's business needs, in particular that the paper has avoided reporting anything that is unflattering to the government of the People's Republic of China, where Murdoch has invested heavily in satellite television.&lt;ref name=PageSix&gt;{{cite news|author=James Barron and Campbell Robertson|title=Page Six, Staple of Gossip, Reports on Its Own Tale|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 19, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/19/nyregion/19six.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;oref=slogin|accessdate=May 19, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202074313/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/19/nyregion/19six.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;oref=slogin|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has recently allowed criticism of the People's Republic of China and its handling of [[2019 Hong Kong protests|the Hong Kong protests.]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2019/10/09/devine-adam-silvers-political-stances-are-empty-after-rushing-to-beijing/|title=Devine: Adam Silver's political stances mean nothing after he grovels to China|last=Miranda Devine|date=2019-10-10|website=New York Post|language=en|access-date=2019-10-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191208223911/https://nypost.com/2019/10/09/devine-adam-silvers-political-stances-are-empty-after-rushing-to-beijing/|archive-date=December 8, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[Ken Auletta]] writes that Murdoch "doesn't hesitate to use the Post to belittle his business opponents". He goes on to say that Murdoch's support for [[Edward I. Koch]] while he was running for mayor of New York "spilled over onto the news pages of the Post, with the paper regularly publishing glowing stories about Koch and sometimes savage accounts of his four primary opponents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Auletta |first1=Ken |title=Promises, Promises |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/07/02/promises-promises-2 |accessdate=26 April 2019 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=25 June 2007 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111024350/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/07/02/promises-promises-2 |archive-date=January 11, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Ronald Reagan]]'s campaign team credited Murdoch and the Post for his victory in New York in the [[1980 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mahler |first1=Jonathan |last2=Rutenberg |first2=Jim |title=How Rupert Murdoch's Empire of Influence Remade the World |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/03/magazine/rupert-murdoch-fox-news-trump.html |accessdate=26 April 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426130110/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/03/magazine/rupert-murdoch-fox-news-trump.html |archive-date=April 26, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan later "waived a prohibition against owning a television station and a newspaper in the same market," allowing Murdoch to continue to control ''The New York Post'' and ''[[The Boston Herald]]'' while expanding into television.

Critics say that the ''Post'' allows its editorial positions to shape its story selection and news coverage. Former ''Post'' executive editor [[Steven D. Cuozzo]] has responded that the ''Post'' "broke the elitist media stranglehold on the national agenda."

According to a survey conducted by [[Pace University]] in 2004, the ''Post'' was rated the least-credible major news outlet in New York, and the only news outlet to receive more responses calling it "not credible" than credible (44% not credible to 39% credible).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appserv.pace.edu/emplibrary/pace_poll_061604.pdf|author=Jonathan Trichter|title=Tabloids, Broadsheets, and Broadcast News|work=Pace Poll Survey Research Study|date=June 16, 2004|accessdate=June 7, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040623180156/http://appserv.pace.edu/emplibrary/pace_poll_061604.pdf|archive-date=June 23, 2004|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] song "[[A Letter to the New York Post|A Letter to the ''New York Post'']]" from their album ''[[Apocalypse '91...The Enemy Strikes Black]]'' is a complaint about what they believed to be negative and inaccurate coverage blacks received from the paper.

The ''Post''{{'}}s coverage of the 2014 murder of [[Hasidic]] landlord Menachem Stark prompted outrage from Jewish communal leaders and public figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forward.com/articles/190356/questions-and-outrage-surround-menachem-starks-bru/ |title=Questions and Outrage Surround Menachem Stark's Brutal Murder – |publisher=Forward.com |date=January 5, 2014 |accessdate=February 13, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226092300/http://forward.com/articles/190356/questions-and-outrage-surround-menachem-starks-bru |archive-date=February 26, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been numerous controversies surrounding the ''Post'':
* In 1997, a national news story concerning [[Rebecca Sealfon]]'s victory in the [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]] circulated. Sealfon was sponsored by the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', a direct in-market competitor. ''Post'' published a picture of her but altered the photograph to remove the name of the ''Daily News'' as printed on a placard she was wearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=David|first=Shenk|authorlink=David Shenk|title=Every Picture Can Tell a Lie|magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=October 20, 1997|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/1997/10/7815|access-date=March 22, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417045414/http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/1997/10/7815|archive-date=April 17, 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On December 4, 2012, ''Post'' used a picture taken by a freelance photographer, R. Umar Abbasi, of a 58-year-old man identified as Ki Suk Han struggling to climb back up onto the platform of the [[49th Street (BMT Broadway Line)|49th Street]] station as a [[New York City Subway|subway]] train approached. The caption on the front read, "Pushed on the subway track, this man is about to die" on top, and "DOOMED" in large, boldface print on the bottom. The image caused outrage among many, as its use was viewed as exploiting a tragedy for commercial gain, though Abbasi stated that since he was not strong enough to pull the man up, he had attempted to use the flash on his camera to alert the driver of the oncoming train.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thespec.com/news/ontario/article/848198--furor-over-ny-post-photo-of-doomed-man|author=Curtis Rush|title=Furor over NY Post photo of doomed man|work=Thespec.com|date=December 4, 2012|access-date=December 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208012755/http://www.thespec.com/news/ontario/article/848198--furor-over-ny-post-photo-of-doomed-man|archive-date=December 8, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was used as inspiration for the 2014 musical [[Ghost Quartet]].

The ''Post'' and the ''Daily News'' often take potshots at each other's work and accuracy, particularly in their respective gossip-page items.

In 1996, the ''New York Post'' launched an [[Internet]] version of the paper. The original site included color photos and sections broken down into News, Sports, Editorial, Gossip, Entertainment and Business. It also had an archive for the past seven days. Since then, it has been redesigned a number of times, with the latest incarnation launched in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adage.com/article/digital/york-post-a-digital-ad-units/243985/|title=THE NEW YORK POST GETS A NEW DIGITAL LOOK, AND NEW AD UNITS|last=|first=|date=September 5, 2013|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413043759/http://adage.com/article/digital/york-post-a-digital-ad-units/243985/|archive-date=April 13, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vip.wordpress.com/2013/09/05/new-york-post-is-now-on-wordpress-com-vip/|title=New York Post is now on WordPress.com VIP|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413043825/https://vip.wordpress.com/2013/09/05/new-york-post-is-now-on-wordpress-com-vip/|archive-date=April 13, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current website also features continually updated breaking news; opinion, entertainment, business, tech, media, fashion and sports content; photo and video galleries; original ''Post'' videos; and streaming video for live events.

In 2014, the ''Post'' launched the website Decider. Decider provides recommendation for streaming services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = ''NY''´s 'Decider' Launches| accessdate = February 27, 2017| url = http://www.adweek.com/digital/ny-posts-decider-launches/| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170228003228/http://www.adweek.com/digital/ny-posts-decider-launches/| archive-date = February 28, 2017| url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the 2017–18 television season, a daily [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] series known as '''''Page Six TV''''' came to air, produced by [[20th Television]], which was part of the [[21st Century Fox]] side of Rupert Murdoch's holdings, and [[Endemol Shine North America]]. The show is hosted by comedian [[John Fugelsang]], with contributions from ''Page Six'' and ''Post'' writers (including Carlos Greer), along with regular panelists [[Elizabeth Wagmeister]] from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and [[Bevy Smith]]. In March 2018, Fugelsang left and Page Six TV announced it was looking for a new host. Later it was announced that Wagmeister, Greer and Smith would be retained as equal co-hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/john-fugelsang-leaves-page-six-tv-guest-hosts-filling-in/|title = John Fugelsang Leaves 'Page Six TV': Meet the Guest Hosts Filling in|date = March 23, 2018|access-date = May 28, 2018|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180528215547/https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/john-fugelsang-leaves-page-six-tv-guest-hosts-filling-in/|archive-date = May 28, 2018|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2019, it was reported that the series would not be renewed for a third season; by then, it was last in average viewership out of all U.S. syndicated newsmagazine programs, behind the similar tabloid-inspired program ''[[Daily Mail]] TV''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/04/page-six-tv-syndicated-pop-culture-show-end-second-season-1202589350/|title='Page Six TV' To End After Second Season|date=2019-04-05|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-04-13|last3=Andreeva|first3=Nellie|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190408170636/https://deadline.com/2019/04/page-six-tv-syndicated-pop-culture-show-end-second-season-1202589350/|archive-date=April 8, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sales===
The daily circulation of ''Post'' decreased in the final years of the Schiff era from 700,000 around 1967–68, to approximately 517,000 by the time she sold the paper to Murdoch in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carmody |first1=Deirdre |title=Dorothy Schiff Agrees to Sell Post To Murdoch, Australian Publisher |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/11/20/archives/new-jersey-pages-dorothy-schiff-agrees-to-sell-post-to-murdoch.html |website=nytimes.com  |accessdate=19 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Murdoch, ''Post'' launched a morning edition to compete directly with the rival tabloid ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]'' in 1978—prompting the ''Daily News'' to retaliate with a PM edition called ''Daily News Tonight''. But the PM edition suffered the same problems with worsening daytime traffic that the afternoon ''Post'' experienced and the ''Daily News'' ultimately folded ''Tonight'' in 1981. By that time, circulation of the all-day ''Post'' soared to a peak of 962,000, the bulk of the increase attributed to its morning edition (It set a single-day record of 1.1 million on August 11, 1977 with the news of the arrest the night before of [[David Berkowitz]], the infamous "Son of Sam" serial killer who terrorized New York for much of that summer). But ''Post'' lost so much money that Murdoch decided to shut down ''Post''{{'}}s PM edition in 1982, turning ''Post'' into a morning-only daily.

''Post'' and the ''Daily News'' have been locked in a bitter circulation war ever since. A resurgence during the first decade of the 21st century saw ''Post'' circulation rise to 724,748 by April 2007,&lt;ref name=circ/&gt; achieved partly by lowering the price from 50 cents to 25 cents. In October 2006, ''Post'' for the first time surpassed the ''Daily News'' in circulation—only to see the ''Daily News'' overtake its rival a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [https://www.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2007-11-05-newspaper-circulation_N.htm "Newspaper circulation off 2.6%; some count Web readers"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805040220/http://www.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2007-11-05-newspaper-circulation_N.htm |date=August 5, 2011 }}, November 5, 2007. Accessed June 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the ''Post''{{'}}s daily circulation was 525,004, just 10,000 behind the ''Daily News''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fitzgerald|first1=Mark|title=Top 25 Dailies: Like Newspaper Revenue, the Decline in Circ Shows Signs of Slowing|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/news/top-25-dailies-like-newspaper-revenue-the-decline-in-circ-shows-signs-of-slowing/|accessdate=March 14, 2016|work=Editor &amp; Publisher|date=April 26, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314160808/http://www.editorandpublisher.com/news/top-25-dailies-like-newspaper-revenue-the-decline-in-circ-shows-signs-of-slowing/|archive-date=March 14, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017}}, the ''Post'' was the fourth-largest newspaper in the United States by circulation, while the ''Daily News'' was ranked eighth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/america-100-largest-newspapers-180528599.html |title=America's 100 Largest Newspapers |work=[[Yahoo!

Yet ''Post'' has remained unprofitable since Murdoch first purchased it from Dorothy Schiff in 1976—and was on the brink of folding when Murdoch bought it back in 1993, with at least one media report in 2012 indicating that ''Post'' loses up to $70 million a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/28/rupert-murdoch-wall-street-journal-news-corp_n_1635680.html|author=Michael Calderone|title=Rupert Murdoch Suggests Wall Street Journal Won't Face Cuts In News Corp.

===Recent headquarters===
The 1906 [[Old New York Evening Post Building]] is a designated landmark. It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1977.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occupied the building until 1926 when a new main office for the ''Post'' was established at 75 West Street in the [[New York Evening Post Building]]. The building remained in use by the ''Post'' until 1970, it was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; In 1967, Schiff bought 210 South Street, the former headquarters of the ''[[New York Journal American]]'', which closed a year earlier. The building became an instantly recognizable symbol for the ''Post''. In 1995, owner Rupert Murdoch relocated ''Post''{{'}}s news and business offices to the [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]] headquarters tower at 1211 [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Avenue of the Americas]] (Sixth Avenue) in midtown Manhattan.  ''Post'' shares this building with [[Fox News Channel]] and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', both of which are also owned by Murdoch.  Both the ''Post'' and the New York City edition of the ''Journal'' are printed at a state-of-the-art printing plant in the borough of [[The Bronx]].

[[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]'s 1991 album ''[[Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black]]'' featured a song titled "A Letter to the New York Post" that was highly critical of the paper.
