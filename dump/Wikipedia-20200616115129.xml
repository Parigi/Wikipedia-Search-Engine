'''Lucca''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|uː|k|ə}} {{respell|LOO|kə}}, {{IPA-it|ˈlukka|lang|It-Lucca.ogg}}) is a city and ''[[comune]]'' in [[Tuscany]], [[Central Italy]], on the [[Serchio]], in a fertile plain near the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]. It is the capital of the [[Province of Lucca]]. It is famous for its intact [[Renaissance]]-era [[city walls]].&lt;ref name=luccawalls&gt;{{cite web|last=Magrini|first=Graziano|title=The Walls of Lucca|url=http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/itineraries/place/TheWallsOfLucca.html|work=Scientific Itineraries of Tuscany|publisher=Museo Galileo|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimesmenu&gt;{{cite news|last=DONADIO|first=Rachel|title=A Walled City in Tuscany Clings to Its Ancient Menu|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/13/world/europe/13lucca.html?_r=0|work=March 12, 2009|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Lucca}}

===Ancient and medieval city===
Lucca was founded by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] (there are traces of an earlier [[Liguri]]an settlement in the 3rd century BC called ''Luk'' meaning marsh in which the name Lucca originated) and became a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] colony in 180 BC.&lt;ref name="h.f.ullmann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haegen|first1=Anne Mueller von der|last2=Strasser|first2=Ruth F.|title=Art &amp; Architecture: Tuscany|year=2013|publisher=H.F.Ullmann Publishing|location=Potsdam|isbn=978-3-8480-0321-1|page=57|chapter=Lucca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rectangular grid of its historical centre preserves the Roman street plan, and the Piazza San Michele occupies the site of the ancient [[Forum (Roman)|forum]]. Traces of the [[amphitheatre]] may still be seen in the [[Piazza dell'Anfiteatro, Lucca|Piazza dell'Anfiteatro]].

At the [[Lucca Conference]], in 56 BC, [[Julius Caesar]], [[Pompey]], and [[Crassus]] reaffirmed their political alliance known as the [[First Triumvirate]].&lt;ref name="h.f.ullmann" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boatwright, Mary et al. ''The Romans: From Village to Empire'', pg 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Torre guinigi, view 11, piazza dell'anfiteatro.JPG|thumb|left|[[Piazza dell'Anfiteatro]] and the [[Basilica of San Frediano]]]]
[[Frediano]], an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[monk]], was [[bishop of Lucca]] in the early sixth century.&lt;ref&gt;See article on the [[Basilica of San Frediano|Basilica di San Frediano]].&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, Lucca was plundered by [[Odoacer]], the first Germanic King of Italy. Lucca was an important city and fortress even in the sixth century, when [[Narses]] besieged it for several months in 553. Under the [[Lombards]], it was the seat of a duke who minted his own coins. The [[Holy Face of Lucca]] (or Volto Santo), a major relic supposedly carved by [[Nicodemus]], arrived in 742. During the eighth-tenth centuries Lucca was a center of [[Jewish]] life, the community being led by the [[Kalonymos family]] (which at some point during this time migrated to Germany to become a major component of proto-[[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic Jewry]]). Lucca became prosperous through the [[silk]] trade that began in the eleventh century, and came to rival the silks of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. During the tenth–eleventh centuries Lucca was the capital of the feudal [[margraviate of Tuscany]], more or less independent but owing nominal allegiance to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].

===First republic===
{{main|Republic of Lucca}}
After the death of [[Matilda of Tuscany]], the city began to constitute itself an independent [[Medieval commune|commune]] with a charter in 1160. For almost 500 years, Lucca remained an independent republic. There were many minor provinces in the region between southern [[Liguria]] and northern Tuscany dominated by the [[Malaspina family|Malaspina]]; Tuscany in this time was a part of feudal Europe. [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]’s ''Divine Comedy'' includes many references to the great feudal families who had huge jurisdictions with administrative and judicial rights. Dante spent some of his exile in Lucca.

In 1273 and again in 1277, Lucca was ruled by a [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] ''[[capitano del popolo]]'' (captain of the people) named [[Luchetto Gattilusio]]. In 1314, internal discord allowed [[Uguccione della Faggiuola]] of Pisa to make himself lord of Lucca. The Lucchesi expelled him two years later, and handed over the city to another  ''[[condottiero]]'', [[Castruccio Castracani]], under whose rule it became a leading state in central Italy. Lucca rivalled [[Florence]] until Castracani's death in 1328. On 22 and 23 September 1325, in the [[battle of Altopascio]], Castracani defeated [[Florence]]'s Guelphs. For this he was nominated by [[Louis IV the Bavarian]] to become duke of Lucca. Castracani's tomb is in the church of San Francesco. His biography is [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s third famous book on political rule.

In 1408, Lucca hosted the [[convocation]] intended to end the schism in the papacy. Occupied by the troops of Louis of Bavaria, the city was sold to a rich Genoese, Gherardino Spinola, then seized by John, king of Bohemia. Pawned to the Rossi of Parma, by them it was ceded to [[Mastino II della Scala]] of [[Verona]], sold to the Florentines, surrendered to the Pisans, and then nominally liberated by the emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] and governed by his vicar. Lucca managed, at first as a [[democracy]], and after 1628 as an [[oligarchy]], to maintain its independence alongside of [[Venice]] and [[Genoa]], and painted the word ''Libertas'' on its banner until the French Revolution in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (1911)&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Napoleonic conquest===
[[File:Palazzo pfanner, giardini 03.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palazzo Pfanner]], garden view]]
Lucca had been the second largest Italian city state (after [[Venice]]) with a republican constitution ("comune") to remain independent over the centuries.

In 1805, Lucca was conquered by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], who installed his sister [[Elisa Bonaparte|Elisa Bonaparte Baciocchi]] as "Princess of Lucca".

From 1815 to 1847 it was a [[Bourbon house|Bourbon-Parma]] [[Duchy of Lucca|duchy]]. The only reigning dukes of Lucca were [[Maria Luisa of Spain, Duchess of Lucca|Maria Luisa of Spain]], who was succeeded by her son [[Charles II, Duke of Parma]] in 1824. Meanwhile, the [[Duchy of Parma]] had been assigned for life to [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]], the second wife of [[Napoleon]]. In accordance with the [[Treaty of Vienna (1815)]], upon the death of [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]] in 1847, Parma reverted to [[Charles II, Duke of Parma]], while Lucca lost independence and was annexed to the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]]. As part of Tuscany, it became part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] in 1860 and finally part of the [[Italy|Italian State]] in 1861.
===World War II internment camp===
{{Further|List of World War II prisoner-of-war camps in Italy}}
In 1942, during [[World War II]], a [[prisoner-of-war]] camp was established at the village of [[Colle di Compecito]], in the municipality of [[Capannori]], about {{convert|11|km}} from Lucca. Its official number was P.G. (''prigionieri di guerra'') 60,&lt;ref name=memorial&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Megargee | editor1-first=G.P. | editor-last2=White | editor-first2=J.R. | title=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933–1945, Volume III: Camps and Ghettos under European Regimes Aligned with Nazi Germany|chapter=Colle di Compecito|first=Silvia Q.|last=Angelini | publisher=Indiana University Press | year=2018 | isbn=978-0-253-02386-5 | url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=8nBTDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA421 | access-date=26 May 2020  | page=421}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was usually referred to as PG 60 Lucca.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web | title=Ill-treatment of prisoners of war at Camp PG 60, Lucca, Italy, July to November 1942 | website=The National Archives | date=2008-12-18 | url=https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/record?catid=8803320&amp;catln=6 | access-date=26 May 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it never had permanent structures and accommodation consisted of tents in an area prone to flooding, it housed more than 3,000 British and [[British Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] prisoners of war during the period of its existence. It was handed over to the Germans on 10 September 1943, not long after the signing of the [[Italian armistice]]. During the [[Italian Social Republic]], as a [[puppet state]] of the Germans, [[political prisoner]]s, foreigners, [[common law]] prisoners and [[Jew]]s were interned there, and it functioned as a [[concentration camp]]. In June 1944 the prisoners were moved to [[Bagni di Lucca#World War II|Bagni di Lucca]].&lt;ref name=memorial/&gt;

===Walls, streets, and squares===
The walls encircling the old town remain intact, even as the city expanded and modernized, unusual for cities in the region. Initially built as a defensive [[rampart (fortification)|rampart]], once the walls lost their military importance they became a pedestrian promenade, the Passeggiata delle Mura Urbane, a street atop the walls linking the bastions. It passes through the Bastions of Santa Croce, San Frediano, San Martino, San Pietro/Battisti, San Salvatore, La Libertà/Cairoli, San Regolo, San Colombano, Santa Maria, San Paolino/Catalani, and San Donato; and over the gates (Porte): San Donato, Santa Maria, San Jocopo, Elisa, San Pietro, and Sant'Anna. Each of the four principal sides of the structure is lined with a different tree species than the others.

The walled city is encircled by Piazzale Boccherini, Viale Lazzaro Papi, Viale Carlo Del Prete, Piazzale Martiri della Libertà, Via Batoni, Viale Agostino Marti, Viale G. Marconi (''vide'' [[Guglielmo Marconi]]), Piazza Don A. Mei, Viale [[Alfredo Pacini|Pacini]], Viale Giusti, Piazza Curtatone, Piazzale Ricasoli, Viale Ricasoli, Piazza Risorgimento (''vide'' [[Risorgimento]]), and Viale [[Giosuè Carducci]].

The town includes a number of public squares, most notably the [[Piazza dell'Anfiteatro, Lucca|Piazza dell'Anfiteatro]], site of ancient Roman amphitheater; but also Piazzale Verdi; Piazza Napoleone'; and Piazza San Michele.
