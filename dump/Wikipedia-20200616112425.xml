== History of ancient DNA studies ==

===1980s===
The first study of what would come to be called aDNA was conducted in 1984, when Russ Higuchi and colleagues at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] reported that traces of DNA from a museum specimen of the [[Quagga]] not only remained in the specimen over 150 years after the death of the individual, but could be extracted and sequenced.&lt;ref name="pmid6504142"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Higuchi R, Bowman B, Freiberger M, Ryder OA, Wilson AC | title = DNA sequences from the quagga, an extinct member of the horse family | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5991 | pages = 282–4 | date = 1984 | pmid = 6504142 | doi = 10.1038/312282a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..282H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next two years, through investigations into natural and artificially mummified specimens, [[Svante Pääbo]] confirmed that this phenomenon was not limited to relatively recent museum specimens but could apparently be replicated in a range of [[Mummy|mummified]] human samples that dated as far back as several thousand years.&lt;ref name="Pääbo 1985a"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pääbo S | year = 1985a | title = Preservation of DNA in ancient Egyptian mummies | journal = J. Archaeol. Sci. | volume = 12 | issue = 6| pages = 411–17 | doi = 10.1016/0305-4403(85)90002-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pääbo 1985b"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pääbo S | title = Molecular cloning of Ancient Egyptian mummy DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 314 | issue = 6012 | pages = 644–5 | year = 1985b | pmid = 3990798 | doi = 10.1038/314644a0 | bibcode = 1985Natur.314..644P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pääbo_1986"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pääbo S | title = Molecular genetic investigations of ancient human remains | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology | volume = 51 Pt 1 | issue = | pages = 441–6 | date = 1986 | pmid = 3107879 | doi = 10.1101/SQB.1986.051.01.053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laborious processes that were required at that time to sequence such DNA (through [[bacterial cloning]]) were an effective brake on the development of the field of ancient DNA (aDNA). However, with the development of the [[Polymerase chain reaction|Polymerase Chain Reaction]] (PCR) in the late 1980s, the field began to progress rapidly.&lt;ref name="pmid3431465"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mullis KB, Faloona FA | title = Specific synthesis of DNA in vitro via a polymerase-catalyzed chain reaction | journal = Methods in Enzymology | volume = 155 | pages = 335–50 | date = 1987 | pmid = 3431465 | doi = 10.1016/0076-6879(87)55023-6 | url = https://archive.org/details/recombinantdna0000unse/page/335 | isbn = 978-0-12-182056-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saiki_1988"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saiki RK, Gelfand DH, Stoffel S, Scharf SJ, Higuchi R, Horn GT, Mullis KB, Erlich HA | display-authors = 6 | title = Primer-directed enzymatic amplification of DNA with a thermostable DNA polymerase | journal = Science | volume = 239 | issue = 4839 | pages = 487–91 | date = January 1988 | pmid = 2448875 | doi = 10.1126/science.239.4839.487 | bibcode = 1988Sci...239..487S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Double primer PCR amplification of aDNA (jumping-PCR) can produce highly skewed and non-authentic sequence artifacts. Multiple primer, [[Nested polymerase chain reaction|nested PCR]] strategy was used to overcome those shortcomings.

=== 1990s ===
The post-PCR era heralded a wave of publications as numerous research groups tried their hands at aDNA. Soon a series of incredible findings had been published, claiming authentic DNA could be extracted from specimens that were millions of years old, into the realms of what Lindahl (1993b) has labelled [[Antediluvian]] DNA.&lt;ref name="Lindahl 1993b"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindahl T | title = Recovery of antediluvian DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 365 | issue = 6448 | pages = 700 | date = October 1993 | pmid = 8413647 | doi = 10.1038/365700a0 | bibcode = 1993Natur.365..700L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of such claims were based on the retrieval of DNA from organisms preserved in [[amber]].

Even these extraordinary ages were topped by the claimed retrieval of 250-million-year-old halobacterial sequences from [[halite]].&lt;ref name="pmid11057666"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vreeland RH, Rosenzweig WD, Powers DW | title = Isolation of a 250 million-year-old halotolerant bacterium from a primary salt crystal | journal = Nature | volume = 407 | issue = 6806 | pages = 897–900 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11057666 | doi = 10.1038/35038060 | bibcode = 2000Natur.407..897V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12024211"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fish SA, Shepherd TJ, McGenity TJ, Grant WD | title = Recovery of 16S ribosomal RNA gene fragments from ancient halite | journal = Nature | volume = 417 | issue = 6887 | pages = 432–6 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12024211 | doi = 10.1038/417432a | bibcode = 2002Natur.417..432F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Whole genome sequencing]] started to yield results in 1995.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

===2000s===

== Problems and errors ==

===Degradation processes===
Due to degradation processes (including cross-linking, deamination and fragmentation) ancient DNA is of lower quality in comparison with modern genetic material.&lt;ref name="Allentoft, M.E. 2012"/&gt; The damage characteristics and ability of aDNA to survive through time restricts possible analyses and places an upper limit on the age of successful samples. &lt;ref name="Allentoft, M.E. 2012" /&gt; There is a theoretical correlation between time and DNA degradation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hebsgaard MB, Phillips MJ, Willerslev E | title = Geologically ancient DNA: fact or artefact? | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 212–20 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15866038 | doi = 10.1016/j.tim.2005.03.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although differences in environmental conditions complicates things. Samples subjected to different conditions are unlikely to predictably align to a uniform age-degradation relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hansen AJ, Mitchell DL, Wiuf C, Paniker L, Brand TB, Binladen J, Gilichinsky DA, Rønn R, Willerslev E | display-authors = 6 | title = Crosslinks rather than strand breaks determine access to ancient DNA sequences from frozen sediments | journal = Genetics | volume = 173 | issue = 2 | pages = 1175–9 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16582426 | pmc = 1526502 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.106.057349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The environmental effects may even matter after excavation, as DNA decay rates may increase,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pruvost M, Schwarz R, Correia VB, Champlot S, Braguier S, Morel N, Fernandez-Jalvo Y, Grange T, Geigl EM | display-authors = 6 | title = Freshly excavated fossil bones are best for amplification of ancient DNA | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 3 | pages = 739–44 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17210911 | pmc = 1783384 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0610257104 | bibcode = 2007PNAS..104..739P }}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly under fluctuating storage conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burger J, Hummel S, Hermann B, Henke W | title = DNA preservation: a microsatellite-DNA study on ancient skeletal remains | journal = Electrophoresis | volume = 20 | issue = 8 | pages = 1722–8 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10435438 | doi = 10.1002/(sici)1522-2683(19990101)20:8&lt;1722::aid-elps1722&gt;3.0.co;2-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even under the best preservation conditions, there is an upper boundary of 0.4–1.5 million years for a sample to contain sufficient DNA for contemporary sequencing technologies.&lt;ref name="Willerslev, E. 2004. pp.9"/&gt;

Research into the decay of [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] and [[nuclear DNA]] in [[Moa]] bones has modelled mitochondrial DNA degradation to an average length of 1 [[base pair]] after 6,830,000 years at −5&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Allentoft, M.E. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Allentoft ME, Collins M, Harker D, Haile J, Oskam CL, Hale ML, Campos PF, Samaniego JA, Gilbert MT, Willerslev E, Zhang G, Scofield RP, Holdaway RN, Bunce M | display-authors = 6 | title = The half-life of DNA in bone: measuring decay kinetics in 158 dated fossils | journal = Proceedings.

As such, early studies that reported recovery of much older DNA, for example from [[Cretaceous]] [[dinosaur]] remains, may have stemmed from contamination of the sample.

===Age limit===
A critical review of ancient DNA literature through the development of the field highlights that few studies after about 2002 have succeeded in amplifying DNA from remains older than several hundred thousand years.&lt;ref name="pmid12702808"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Willerslev E, Hansen AJ, Binladen J, Brand TB, Gilbert MT, Shapiro B, Bunce M, Wiuf C, Gilichinsky DA, Cooper A | display-authors = 6 | title = Diverse plant and animal genetic records from Holocene and Pleistocene sediments | journal = Science | volume = 300 | issue = 5620 | pages = 791–5 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12702808 | doi = 10.1126/science.1084114 | bibcode = 2003Sci...300..791W }}&lt;/ref&gt; A greater appreciation for the risks of environmental contamination and studies on the [[chemical stability]] of DNA have resulted in concerns being raised over previously reported results.

== Human aDNA ==
Due to the considerable [[anthropology|anthropological]], [[archaeology|archaeological]], and [[public interest]] directed toward human remains, they have received considerable attention from the DNA community.  There are also more profound contamination issues, since the specimens belong to the same species as the researchers collecting and evaluating the samples.

===Sources===
Due to the [[comparative anatomy|morphological]] preservation in mummies, many studies from the 1990s and 2000s used mummified tissue as a source of ancient human DNA. Examples include both naturally preserved specimens, for example, those preserved in ice, such as the [[Ötzi the Iceman]],&lt;ref name="Handt_1994"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Handt O, Richards M, Trommsdorff M, Kilger C, Simanainen J, Georgiev O, Bauer K, Stone A, Hedges R, Schaffner W | display-authors = 6 | title = Molecular genetic analyses of the Tyrolean Ice Man | journal = Science | volume = 264 | issue = 5166 | pages = 1775–8 | date = June 1994 | pmid = 8209259 | doi = 10.1126/science.8209259 | bibcode = 1994Sci...264.1775H }}&lt;/ref&gt; or through rapid [[desiccation]], such as high-altitude mummies from the Andes,&lt;ref name="Pääbo_1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Montiel ''et al.'' 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Montiel R, Malgosa A, Francalacci P | title = Authenticating ancient human mitochondrial DNA | journal = Human Biology | volume = 73 | issue = 5 | pages = 689–713 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11758690 | doi = 10.1353/hub.2001.0069 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as various sources of artificially preserved tissue (such as the chemically treated mummies of ancient Egypt).&lt;ref name="pmid7806242"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hänni C, Laudet V, Coll J, Stehelin D | title = An unusual mitochondrial DNA sequence variant from an Egyptian mummy | journal = Genomics | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 487–9 | date = July 1994 | pmid = 7806242 | doi = 10.1006/geno.1994.1417 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, mummified remains are a limited resource.

Taking preventative measures in their procedure against such contamination though, a 2012 study analyzed bone samples of a [[Neanderthal]] group in the El Sidrón cave, finding new insights on potential kinship and genetic diversity from the aDNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lalueza-Fox C, Rosas A, de la Rasilla M | title = Palaeogenetic research at the El Sidrón Neanderthal site | journal = Annals of Anatomy = Anatomischer Anzeiger | volume = 194 | issue = 1 | pages = 133–7 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 21482084 | doi = 10.1016/j.aanat.2011.01.014 | series = Special Issue: Ancient DNA | hdl = 10261/79609 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, scientists reported finding a 110,000-year-old tooth containing DNA from the [[Denisovan|Denisovan hominin]], an [[extinct]] [[species]] of [[human]] in the genus [[Homo]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20151116"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl | name-list-format = vanc  |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=In a Tooth, DNA From Some Very Old Cousins, the Denisovans |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/17/science/in-a-tooth-dna-from-some-very-old-cousins-the-denisovans.html |date=16 November 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=16 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS-20151111"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sawyer S, Renaud G, Viola B, Hublin JJ, Gansauge MT, Shunkov MV, Derevianko AP, Prüfer K, Kelso J, Pääbo S | display-authors = 6 | title = Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences from two Denisovan individuals | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 112 | issue = 51 | pages = 15696–700 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26630009 | pmc = 4697428 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1519905112 | bibcode = 2015PNAS..11215696S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research has added new complexity to the peopling of Eurasia. It has also revealed new information about links between the ancestors of Central Asians and the indigenous peoples of the Americas. In Africa, older DNA degrades quickly due to the warmer tropical climate, although, in September 2017, ancient DNA samples, as old as 8,100 years old, have been reported.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170921"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl | name-list-format = vanc |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=Clues to Africa's Mysterious Past Found in Ancient Skeletons |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/science/africa-dna-migration.html |date=21 September 2017|work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=21 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, ancient DNA has helped researchers to estimate modern human divergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schlebusch CM, Malmström H, Günther T, Sjödin P, Coutinho A, Edlund H, Munters AR, Vicente M, Steyn M, Soodyall H, Lombard M, Jakobsson M | display-authors = 6 | title = Southern African ancient genomes estimate modern human divergence to 350,000 to 260,000 years ago | journal = Science | volume = 358 | issue = 6363 | pages = 652–655 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28971970 | doi = 10.1126/science.aao6266 | bibcode = 2017Sci...358..652S | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; By sequencing African genomes from three Stone Age hunter gatherers (2000 years old) and four Iron Age farmers (300 to 500 years old), Schlebusch and colleagues were able to push back the date of the earliest divergence between human populations to 350,000 to 260,000 years ago.
