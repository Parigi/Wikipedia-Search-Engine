==Biography==

===Early years and military service===
Brady was born in [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name=NewsdayObit&gt;{{Cite news|last=Gay|first=Verne|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/printedition/longisland/ny-librady286014672jan28,0,6807861.story|title=Prolific writer, publisher and Hamptons fixture James Brady|work=[[Newsday]]|date=January 28, 2009|accessdate=January 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His career in journalism started working as a copy boy for the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', where he worked while attending [[Manhattan College]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; He graduated in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jasperjottings.com/2009/jasperjottings2009W05.html#mozTocId84386&lt;/ref&gt; He left the paper to serve in the [[United States Marine Corps]] during the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; During the war, he was a member of the [[2nd Battalion 7th Marines|2nd Battalion, 7th Marines]] first leading a rifle platoon and later acting as an executive officer of a rifle company at one point serving under [[John Chafee]]. The majority of his service took place in the [[North Korea]]n [[Taebaek Mountains]] during the fall and bitterly cold winter of 1951 and 1952. During this time he was also promoted to First Lieutenant. Brady was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] with the [[Valor device|Combat V]] (recognizing an award resulting from combat heroism) in November 2001 for his actions on May 31, 1952 in a firefight with Chinese forces near [[Panmunjom]].&lt;ref name=ParadeObit&gt;{{Cite news|author=Staff|url=http://www.parade.com/news/2009/01/james-brady.html|title=PARADE Mourns The Passing of Long-Time Contributor James Brady|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|date=January 27, 2009|accessdate=January 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing career===
Brady wrote extensively about his experiences as a Marine in Korea, including his 1990 autobiography, ''The Coldest War'', which was  nominated for a [[Pulitzer Prize]].&lt;ref name=NewsdayObit/&gt; Other books include the 2003 novel ''The Marine'', as well as the non-fiction books ''The Scariest Place in the World'' published in 2005 and the 2007 book ''Why Marines Fight''.&lt;ref name=ParadeObit/&gt; Over the years, Brady spoke to groups of veterans about what he described as a "forgotten war", one where he went to Korea as an immature 23-year-old, and "Nine months later when I left, I was a grown-up and a pretty good Marine officer."&lt;ref name=NewsdayObit/&gt; ''Hero of the Pacific: The Life of Legendary Marine [[John Basilone]]'', about a Marine who was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions at the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]], was completed days before Brady's death.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

Brady also wrote novels about the fashion and media worlds that provided an insider's insights, including ''Paris One'', ''Designs'' and ''The Press Lord.''

Beginning in 1956, Brady worked for Fairchild Publications, first as a business reporter covering Capital Hill, then as ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'''s London bureau chief (’58-’60), Paris bureau chief (’60-‘62), European director (’62-’64) and, once back in New York, editorial director and publisher.  As ''[[Women's Wear Daily|WWD]]''’s publisher, he recrafted the publication to reach out to both the clothing industry and the general public, and created the spin-off ''[[W (magazine)|W]]'', a fashion magazine aimed at the consumer.&lt;ref name=ParadeObit/&gt; He was named editor and publisher of ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' in 1971, where his efforts to modernize the title and aim the publication at a younger audience led to his early termination.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; His experiences in fashion publishing provided input for his 1974 book ''Superchic'' about the industry, described in a review by Jeannette Smyth in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as "his revenge on the fashion world, a way to settle scores with two former employers".&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, Jeannette. [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/120334166.html?dids=120334166:120334166&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=NOV+27%2C+1974&amp;author=By+Jeannette+Smyth&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Of+Gossip+Past+and+'Superchic+'&amp;pqatl=google "Of Gossip Past and 'Superchic'"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', November 27, 1974. Accessed January 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clay Felker]], publisher of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, hired Brady to create the ''Intelligencer'' column.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; Brady, who became editor-in-chief after Felker, wrote and hosted a spinoff TV talk show ''[[New York: Live]]'',  which became the first cable show nominated for and to win several Emmy awards, including one for Brady personally. [[Rupert Murdoch]] hired Brady in 1974 to serve as editor of his new weekly tabloid ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]'', a magazine specializing in celebrity gossip and scandals. Murdoch shifted Brady to the ''[[New York Post]]'' after he bought the paper in 1976, where Brady was a major participant in the creation of ''Page Six'', a celebrity news and gossip column, giving the column its name and serving as the column's first editor.&lt;ref name=ParadeObit/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

Brady added to his workload with an ''[[Advertising Age]]'' column that he penned for more than 25 years, beginning in 1977; and another regular column in ''[[Crain's New York Business]]'' when that publication was created in 1984.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

He wrote the ''In Step With'' celebrity profile column in ''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]'' starting in 1986 and continuing until his death.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;&lt;ref name=wp&gt;{{Cite news |work=Washington Post|title=Diverse Author Profiled Celebrities in Parade Magazine|date=January 29, 2009|page=B5|first=Adam|last=Bernstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; His final column, a profile of actor [[Kevin Bacon]], appeared in the February 15, 2009 issue.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

===Awards===
He received the [[W.Y. Boyd Literary Award for Excellence in Military Fiction]] from the [[American Library Association]] in 2003 for his novel ''Warning of War''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/awards/2/all_years Boyd Award Recipients List&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Brady died at age 80 on January 26, 2009 at his home in [[Manhattan]]. A cause of death was not immediately disclosed, but Brady had suffered a [[stroke]] several years before his death.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Grimes, William. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/29/arts/29brady.html "James Brady, Columnist Chronicling the Power Elite, Dies at 80"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 29, 2009. Accessed January 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his wife (the former Florence Kelly, whom he married in 1958), two daughters (Fiona Brady and author [[Susan Konig]]), four grandchildren, and brother Monsignor Tom Brady who died March 25, 2013.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sheepsheadbites.com/2013/03/good-shepherds-monsignor-thomas-brady-passes-away-after-bout-with-cancer/&lt;/ref&gt;
