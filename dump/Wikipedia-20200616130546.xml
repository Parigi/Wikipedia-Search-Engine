'''Francisco Franco Bahamonde''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|r|æ|ŋ|k|oʊ}}, {{IPA-es|fɾanˈθisko ˈfɾaŋko|lang}}; 4 December 1892&amp;nbsp;– 20 November 1975) was a Spanish general who led the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist forces]] in overthrowing the [[Second Spanish Republic]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and thereafter ruled over Spain from 1939 to 1975 as a dictator, assuming the title ''[[Caudillo]]''. This period in Spanish history, from the Nationalist victory to Franco's death, is commonly known as [[Francoist Spain]] or the Francoist dictatorship. 

Born in [[Ferrol, Spain]] into an upper-class military family, Franco served in the [[Spanish Army]] as a cadet in the [[Toledo Infantry Academy]] from 1907 to 1910. While serving in [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]], he rose through the ranks to become brigadier general in 1926, aged 33, becoming the [[Francisco Franco#Military career|youngest general]] in Spain. Two years later Franco became the director of the [[General Military Academy]] in Zaragoza. As a conservative and [[Monarchism|monarchist]], Franco regretted the abolition of the [[Restoration (Spain)|monarchy]] and the establishment of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] in 1931. He was devastated by the closing of his Academy, but nevertheless continued his service in the [[Spanish Republican Army|Republican Army]].{{sfn|Preston|1994|p=25}} His career redoubled after the right-wing [[Confederación Española de Derechas Autónomas|CEDA]] and [[Radical Republican Party|PRR]] won the [[1933 Spanish general election|1933 election]] empowering him to lead the suppression of the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|1934 uprising in Asturias]]. Franco was briefly elevated to [[Chief of Staff of the Army (Spain)|Chief of Army Staff]] before the [[1936 Spanish general election|1936 election]] moved the leftist [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] into power, relegating him to the [[Canary Islands]]. Two years later Franco, after initial reluctance, joined [[Spanish coup of July 1936|a military coup]] which, after failing to take Spain, sparked the [[Spanish Civil War]].

During the war, he commandeered Spain's [[Army of Africa (Spain)|colonial army in Africa]] and after the death of much of the rebel leadership became [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|his faction's]] only leader, later appointed [[Generalissimo]] and [[List of heads of state of Spain#Francoist Spain (1936%E2%80%931975)|Head of State]] in 1936. He [[Unification Decree (Spain, 1937)|consolidated all nationalist parties]] into the [[FET y de las JONS]] (creating a [[one-party state]]). Three years later the Nationalists declared victory which extended Franco's dictatorship over Spain through a period of [[White Terror (Spain)#Postwar|repression of political opponents]]. His dictatorship's use of [[Unfree labour|forced labor]], [[Francoist concentration camps|concentration camps]], and executions led to between 30,000 and 50,000 deaths.{{refn|&lt;ref name=Paynedeath/&gt;&lt;ref name=ARMH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Casanova&gt;Maestre, F.

''The Battle for Spain; The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939.'' Penguin Books. 2006. London. p.94&lt;/ref&gt;}} In post-war Spain, Franco ruled with more power than any Spanish leader before or since and developed a [[cult of personality]] around his rule by founding the ''[[Movimiento Nacional]]''.  During [[World War II]] he maintained [[Spain during World War II|Spanish neutrality]] but supported the [[Axis powers|Axis]]&amp;nbsp;— whose members [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] had supported him during the Civil War&amp;nbsp;— in various ways, [[Pariah state|damaging]] the country's international reputation.

During the start of the [[Cold War]], Franco lifted Spain out of its [[Economic history of Spain#The Franco Era, 1939%E2%80%9375|mid-19th century economic depression]] through [[Opus Dei and politics|technocratic]] and [[Economic liberalization|economically liberal]] policies, presiding over a period of rampant growth known as the "[[Spanish miracle]]". At the same time, his regime transitioned from being [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] to authoritarian with limited [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]] and became a leader in the anti-Communist movement, garnering support from [[Western world|the West]], particularly the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Rubottom, R 19842"&gt;Rubottom, R. Richard and Murphy, J. Carter (1984) ''Spain and the United States: Since World War II''. Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Francisco Franco#Payne2000|Payne (2000)]], p. 645&lt;/ref&gt; The dictatorship softened and [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] became Franco's ''[[éminence grise]]'', whose role expanded after Franco struggled with [[Parkinson's disease]] in the 1960s. In 1973 Franco resigned as prime minister – separated from the head of state office [[Organic Law of the State|since 1966]] – due to advanced age and illness, but remained in power as the latter and commander-in-chief. Franco died in 1975, aged 82, and was entombed in the [[Valle de los Caídos]]. He [[Law of Succession to the Headship of the State|restored the monarchy]] in his final years, being succeeded by [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]] as [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]], who, in turn, led the [[Spanish transition to democracy]]. 

The [[Francisco Franco#Legacy|legacy of Franco in Spanish history]] remains controversial as the nature of his dictatorship [[Francoist Spain#Legacy|changed over time]]. His reign was marked by both brutal repression, with thousands killed, and economic prosperity, which greatly improved the quality of life in Spain. His dictatorial style proved highly adaptable, which enabled wide-sweeping social and economic reform, while consistent pursuits during his reign centered on authoritarianism, [[Spanish nationalism|nationalism]], [[National Catholicism|national catholicism]], [[Anti-Masonry|anti-freemasonry]], and [[anti-communism]].

== Early life ==
[[File:Padres-de-Franco.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.65|His parents with Francisco in arms, on the day of his baptism on 17 December 1892]]
Francisco Franco Bahamonde was born at 12:30 on 4 December 1892 in the Calle Frutos Saavedra in [[Ferrol, Spain|El Ferrol]], Galicia.&lt;ref name="Preston, p. 1"&gt;[[#Preston|Preston]], p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He was baptised thirteen days later at the military church of San Francisco, with the baptismal name Francisco Paulino Hermenegildo Teódulo;&lt;ref name="Preston, p. 1"/&gt; Francisco for his paternal grandfather, Paulino for his godfather, Hermenegildo for his maternal grandmother and godmother, and Teódulo for the [[Calendar of saints|saint day]] of his birth. Franco was born into a seafaring family. His family had been naval officers for six generations, including several ancestors holding the rank of Admiral.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=7}} 

[[File:Coat of arms of Family Franco Bahamonde until 1940.svg|thumb|upright=0.65|Arms of the Franco family until 1940&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenealoxiasdoortegal.net/ortegal/franco2.htm Vidal y de Barnola, Luis Alfonso].

Ariel. {{ISBN|978-8434467811}}. Retrieved 13 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
His father was of [[Andalusia]]n ancestry.{{efn|After the Spanish Government allowed Sephardi and other Jews to seek refuge via Spain from National Socialist areas, an [[urban legend]] appeared as a form of derision claiming that the Francos were of Sephardi ancestry. [[Stanley G. Payne|Payne]] explains; "Persistent rumors about Franco's alleged Jewish ancestry have no clear foundation, and Harry S. May, ''Francisco Franco: The Jewish Connection'' is somewhat fanciful".&lt;ref name="ancest"/&gt; Furthermore, "a significant portion of the Spanish and Portuguese populations have some remote Jewish ancestry; if this were true of Franco he would simply be in the position of millions of other Spaniards."&lt;ref name="ancest"&gt;[[#Payne2000|Payne (2000)]], p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;}} After relocating to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], the family was strongly involved in the [[Spanish Navy]], and over the span of two centuries produced naval officers for six uninterrupted generations, down to Franco's father Nicolás Franco y Salgado Araújo (22 November 1855 – 22 February 1942).

His mother was María del Pilar Bahamonde y Pardo de Andrade (15 October 1865 – 28 February 1934) from an upper middle-class [[Roman Catholic]] family. Her father, Ladislao Bahamonde Ortega, was the commissar of naval equipment at the Port. Franco's parents married in 1890 in the Church of San Francisco in el Ferrol.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Preston|Preston]], p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The young Franco spent much of his childhood with his two brothers, [[Nicolás Franco (politician)|Nicolás]] (Ferrol, 1891–1977) and [[Ramón Franco|Ramón]], and his two sisters, María del Pilar (Ferrol, 1894 – Madrid, 1989), and María de la Paz (Ferrol, 1899 – Ferrol, 1903). The latter died in infancy. His brother Nicolás was later a [[Spanish Navy|naval]] [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] and diplomat who in time married María Isabel Pascual del Pobil y Ravello, and was seen as intelligent, the best student of all the siblings and also the most conventional of the brothers.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=8}} Ramón was an internationally renown pioneer aviator, a [[Freemason]] with originally leftist political leanings and was generally the most audacious and rebellious brother, both socially and politically. He was also the second sibling to die, killed in an air accident on a military mission in 1938.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=8–9}} María del Pilar was known for being lively and highly social; she married Alonso Jaráiz y Jeréz and had ten children, five after she was 45 years old; several of her sons would go on to have careers in the military, while two of her daughters would marry officers.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=7}} 

Franco's father was a naval officer who reached the rank of vice admiral (''intendente general''). When Franco was fourteen, his father moved away to Madrid following a reassignment and ultimately abandoned his family, marrying another woman. While Franco did not suffer any great abuse at his father's hand, he would never overcome his antipathy for his father and largely ignored him for the rest of his life; years after becoming dictator, Franco wrote a brief novel ''Raza'' under the pseudonym Jaime de Andrade, whose protagonist is believed by Stanley Payne to represent the idealised man Franco wished his father had been. Conversely, Franco strongly identified with his mother (who always wore widow's black once she realised her husband had abandoned her) and learned from her moderation, austerity, self-control, family solidarity and respect for Catholicism, though he would also inherit his father's harshness, coldness and implacability.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=5–8}}

== Military career ==
=== Rif War and advancement through the ranks ===
Francisco was to follow his father into the Navy, but as a result of the [[Spanish–American War]] the country lost much of its navy as well as most of its colonies. Not needing any more officers, the Naval Academy admitted no new entrants from 1906 to 1913. To his father's chagrin, Francisco decided to try the [[Spanish Army]]. In 1907, he entered the Infantry Academy in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. At the age of fourteen, Franco was one of the youngest members of his class, with most boys being between sixteen and eighteen. He was short and was bullied for his small size. His grades were average, though his good memory meant he seldom struggled in mental tests but his small stature was a hindrance in physical tests. He would graduate in July 1910 as second lieutenant, coming in at position 251 out of 312, though this may have been less to do with his grades than his small size, young age and reduced physical presence; Stanley Payne observes that by the time Civil War began, Franco had already become a major general and would soon be a generalissimo, while none of his higher-ranking fellow cadets had managed to get beyond the rank of lieutenant-colonel.{{Sfn|Jensen|2005|pp=13–14}}{{Sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=12–15}} At 19, Franco was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant in June 1912.{{Sfn|Jensen|2005|p=28}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Franco : a concise biography|last=Ashford.|first=Hodges, Gabrielle|date=2002|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0312282851|edition=1st U.S.|location=New York|oclc=49386039|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/francoconcisebio0000hodg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, he obtained a commission to Morocco. Spanish efforts to occupy their new African [[protectorate]] provoked the [[Second Melillan campaign]] in 1909 with native Moroccans, the first of a period of [[Riffians|Riffian]] rebellions. Their tactics resulted in heavy losses among Spanish [[officer (armed forces)|military officers]], and also provided an opportunity to earn promotion through merit. It was said that officers would receive either ''la caja o la faja'' (a coffin or a general's sash). Franco quickly gained a reputation as a good officer. [[File:Francisco y Ramón Franco 1925.jpg|thumb|left|Francisco and his brother Ramón in [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco|North Africa]], 1925]] In 1913, Franco transferred into the newly formed [[regulares]]: Moroccan colonial troops with Spanish officers, who acted as [[shock troops]]. This transfer into a perilous role may have been decided because Franco failed to win the hand of his first love, [[Sofía Subirán]]. The letters between the two were found and she was questioned by journalists.

In 1916, aged 23 and already a captain, he was shot by enemy machine gun fire. He was badly wounded in the abdomen, specifically the liver, in a skirmish at ''El Biutz''. The physicians of the battle later concluded that his intestines were spared because he inhaled the moment he was shot. In 2008, it was alleged by historian José María Zavala that this injury had left Franco with only [[monorchism|one testicle]]. Zavala cites Ana Puigvert, whose father Antonio Puigvert, was Franco's physician.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/mundo/cultura_sociedad/2009/05/090518_1559_franco_lp |title=Franco, "hombre de un sólo testículo" BBC News Mundo| access-date=27 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His recovery was seen by native troops in Africa as a spiritual event – they believed Franco to be blessed with ''[[Barakah|baraka]],'' or protected by God. He was recommended for promotion to major and to receive Spain's highest honour for gallantry, the coveted ''[[Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand|Cruz Laureada de San Fernando]]''. Both proposals were denied citing the twenty three years old Franco's young age as the reason for denial. Instead Franco received the prestigious ''Cross of Maria Cristina, First Class''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Preston|Preston]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

With that he was promoted to major at the end of February 1917 at age 24. This made him the youngest major in the Spanish army. From 1917 to 1920, he served in Spain. In 1920, Lieutenant Colonel [[José Millán Astray]], a [[wikt:histrionic|histrionic]] but charismatic officer, founded the [[Spanish Foreign Legion]], on similar lines to the [[French Foreign Legion]]. Franco became the Legion's second-in-command and returned to Africa. In the [[Rif War]], on 24 July 1921, the poorly commanded and overextended Spanish Army suffered [[Battle of Annual|a crushing defeat]] at [[Annual (Morocco)|Annual]] from the [[The Republic of the Rif|Republic of the Rif]] led by the [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi|Abd el-Krim]] brothers. The Legion and supporting units relieved the Spanish enclave of [[Melilla]] after a three-day forced march led by Franco. In 1923, by now a [[lieutenant colonel]], he was made commander of the Legion.

On 22 October 1923, Franco married [[Carmen Polo|María del Carmen Polo y Martínez-Valdès]] (11 June 1900 – 6 February 1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://sites.jmu.edu/spanishcivilwar/carmenpolo/ | title=Carmen Polo: La Esposa de Francisco Franco – la Guerra Civil Española | access-date=30 December 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051755/https://sites.jmu.edu/spanishcivilwar/carmenpolo/ | archive-date=31 December 2017 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later on 14 September 1926, the couple had a daughter, [[Carmen Franco y Polo|María del Carmen]]. Franco would have a close relationship with his daughter and was a proud parent, though his traditionalist attitudes and increasing responsibilities meant he left much of the child-rearing to his wife.´´{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=54}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p11214.htm#i112139 Carmen Franco y Polo, 1st Duquesa de Franco]. thePeerage.com.

Promoted to [[colonel]], Franco led the first wave of troops ashore at [[Al Hoceima]] (Spanish: ''Alhucemas'') in 1925. This landing in the heartland of Abd el-Krim's tribe, combined with the French invasion from the south, spelled the beginning of the end for the short-lived [[Republic of the Rif]]. Franco's recognition eventually caught up with him and he was promoted to brigadier general on 3 February 1926. This made him the youngest general in Spain, and perhaps, along with [[Major-General]] [[Joseph Sweeney (Irish politician)|Joe Sweeney]] of the [[Irish Army]], one of the youngest generals in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Television documentary from CC&amp;C Ideacom Production, ''Apocalypse Never-Ending War 1918–1926'', part 2, aired at Danish DR K at 22.October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 Franco was appointed director of the newly created General Military Academy of Zaragoza, a new college for all army [[cadet]]s, replacing the former separate institutions for young men seeking to become officers in infantry, cavalry, artillery, and other branches of the army. Franco was removed as Director of the Zaragoza Military Academy in 1931; about 95% of his former Zaragoza cadets later came to side with him in the Civil War.

=== During the Second Spanish Republic ===
The municipal elections of 12 April 1931 were largely seen as plebiscite on the monarchy. The Republican-Socialist alliance failed to win the majority of the municipality cities in Spain but had a landslide victory in all large cities and in almost all provincial capitals.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=66}} The monarchists and the army deserted Alfonso XIII and the King decided to leave the country into exile, giving way to the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Although Franco believed that the majority of the Spanish people still supported the crown, and although he regretted the end of the monarchy, he did not object, nor did he challenge the legitimacy of the republic.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=68}} But the closing of the Academy in June by the provisional War Minister [[Manuel Azaña]] was a major setback for Franco and provoked his first clash with the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]]. Azaña found Franco's farewell speech to the cadets insulting.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=74}} In his speech Franco stressed the Republic's need for discipline and respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.generalisimofranco.com/discurso12.htm | title = Discurso de Franco a los cadetes de la academia militar de Zaragoza|date = 14 June 1931 | accessdate =21 July 2006 | language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azaña entered an official reprimand into Franco's personnel file and for six months Franco was without a post and under surveillance.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=74}}

In December 1931, a new reformist, liberal, and democratic [[Spanish Constitution of 1931|constitution]] was declared. It included strong provisions enforcing a broad [[secularization|secularisation]] of the Catholic country, which included the abolishing of Catholic schools and charities, which many moderate committed Catholics opposed.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=53}} At this point once the constituent assembly had fullfilled its mandate of approving a new constitution, it should have arranged for regular parliamentary elections and adjourned. Fearing the increasing popular oppostion the Radical and Socialist majority postponed the regular elections, therefore prolonging their way in power for two more years. This way the republican government of [[Manuel Azaña]] initiated numerous reforms to what in their view would "modernize" the country.{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=91}}

Franco was a subscriber to the journal of [[Acción Española]], a monarchist organisation, and a firm believer in a supposed Jewish-Masonic-Bolshevik conspiracy, or ''contubernio'' (filthy cohabitation).  The conspiracy suggested that Jews, Freemasons, Communists, and other leftists alike sought the destruction of Christian Europe, with Spain the principal target.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paul (2010) "The Theorists of Extermination", essay in ''Unearthing Franco's Legacy'', pp. 42, 45. University of Notre Dame Press, {{ISBN|0-268-03268-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Francisco Franco 1930.jpg|thumb|Franco in 1930]]

On 5 February 1932, Franco was given a command in [[A Coruña]]. Franco avoided involvement in [[José Sanjurjo]]'s attempted coup that year, and even wrote a hostile letter to Sanjurjo expressing his anger over the attempt. As a result of Azaña's military reform, in January 1933 Franco was relegated from first to 24th in the list of brigadiers. The same year, on 17 February he was given the military command of the [[Balearic Islands]]. The post was above his rank, but Franco was still angered that he was purposely stuck in positions he disliked. It was quite common for conservative officers to be moved or demoted.

In 1932 the Jesuits who were in charge of the best schools throughout the country were banned and had all their property confiscated. The army was further reduced. Landowners were expropriated. Home rule was granted to Catalonia, with a local parliament and a president of its own. {{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=91}} On June 1933 Pope Pius XI issued the encyclical [[Dilectissima Nobis]], "On Oppression of the Church of Spain", raising his voice against the persecution of the Catholic Church in Spain.{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=93}}

The elections held in October 1933 resulted in a centre-right majority. The political party with the most votes was the Confederación Español de Derechas Autónomas ("CEDA"), but president [[Niceto Alcalá-Zamora|Alcalá-Zamora]] declined to invite the leader of the CEDA, Gil Robles, to form a government. Instead he invited the [[Radical Republican Party]]'s [[Alejandro Lerroux]] to do so. Despite receiving the most votes, CEDA was denied cabinet positions for nearly a year.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=84–85}} After a year of intense pressure, CEDA, the largest party in the congress, was finally successful in forcing the acceptance of three ministries. The entrance of CEDA in the government, despite being normal in a parliamentary democracy, was not well accepted by the left.  The Socialists triggered an insurrection that they had been preparing for nine months.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=88}} A general strike was called by the UGT and the PSOE in the name of the ''Alianza Obrera''. The issue was that the Left Republicans identified the Republic not with democracy or constitutional law but a specific set of left-wing policies and politicians. Any deviation, even if democratic, was seen as treasonous.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Stanley G. The collapse of the Spanish republic, 1933–1936: Origins of the civil war. Yale University Press, 2008, pp.84–85&lt;/ref&gt; A "[[Catalan State (1934)|Catalan State]]" was proclaimed by Catalan nationalist leader [[Lluís Companys|Lluis Companys]], but it lasted just ten hours. Despite an attempt at a general stoppage in [[Madrid]], other strikes did not endure. This left [[Asturias|Asturian]] strikers to fight alone.&lt;ref&gt;Spain 1833–2002, p.133, Mary Vincent, Oxford, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In several mining towns in Asturias, local unions gathered small arms and were determined to see the strike through. It began on the evening of 4 October, with the miners occupying several towns, attacking and seizing local [[Guardia Civil|Civil]] and [[Assault Guard]] barracks.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Gabriel.

Troops of the Spanish [[Army of Africa (Spain)|Army of Africa]] carried this out, with General [[Eduardo López Ochoa]] as commander in the field. After two weeks of heavy fighting (and a death toll estimated between 1,200 and 2,000), the rebellion was suppressed.

The [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|insurgency in Asturias]] sparked a new era of violent anti-Christian persecutions, initiated the practice of atrocities against the clergy&lt;ref name="Cueva 1998 pp. 355-369"/&gt; and sharpened the antagonism between Left and Right. Franco and López Ochoa (who, prior to the campaign in Asturias, had been seen as a left-leaning officer)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Preston|Preston]], p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; emerged as officers prepared to use 'troops against Spanish civilians as if they were a foreign enemy'.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paul (2010) "The Theorists of Extermination", essay in ''Unearthing Franco's Legacy'', p. 61. University of Notre Dame Press, {{ISBN|0-268-03268-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franco described the rebellion to a journalist in [[Oviedo]] as, 'a frontier war and its fronts are socialism, communism and whatever attacks civilisation to replace it with barbarism.' Though the colonial units sent to the north by the government at Franco's recommendation&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; consisted of the [[Spanish Foreign Legion]] and the Moroccan [[Regulares]] Indigenas, the right-wing press portrayed the Asturian rebels as lackeys of a foreign Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;Balfour, Sebastian (2002). ''Deadly Embrace: Morocco and the Road to the Spanish Civil War'', Oxford University Press. pp. 252–254. {{isbn|0199252963}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

With this rebellion against established political legitimate authority, the Socialists showed identical repudiation of representative institutional system that anarchists had practiced.{{sfn|Casanova|2010|p=138}} The Spanish historian [[Salvador de Madariaga]], an Azaña's supporter, and an exhiled vocal opponent of Francisco Franco is the author of a sharp critical reflection against the participation of the left in the revolt: “The uprising of 1934 is unforgivable. The argument that Mr Gil Robles tried to destroy the Constitution to establish fascism was, at once, hypocritical and false. With the rebellion of 1934, the Spanish left lost even the shadow of moral authority to condemn the rebellion of 1936” &lt;ref&gt;Madariaga – Spain (1964) p.416 as cited in {{cite book |last1=Orella Martínez |first1=José Luis |last2=Mizerska-Wrotkowska |first2=Malgorzata |title=Poland and Spain in the interwar and postwar period |date=2015 |publisher=SCHEDAS, S.l |location=Madrid Spain |isbn=9788494418068 |ref=Harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the Civil War, López Ochoa was assassinated. Some time after these events, Franco was briefly commander-in-chief of the Army of Africa (from 15 February onwards), and from 19 May 1935, on, Chief of the General [[staff (military)|Staff]].

==== 1936 general election ====
{{Main|1936 Spanish general election}}
In the end of 1935 President Alcalá-Zamora manipulated a petty-corruption issue into a [[Straperlo|major scandal in parliament]], and eliminated [[Alejandro Lerroux]], the head of the Radical Republican Party, from premiership. Subsequently, Alcalá-Zamora vetoed the logical replacement, a majority center-right coalition, led by the CEDA, which would reflect the composition of the parliament. He then arbitrarily appointed an interim prime minister and after a short period announced the dissolution of parliament and new elections.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=97–98}}

Two wide coalitions formed: the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] on the left, ranging from [[Republican Union (Spain, 1934)|Republican Union]] to [[Communist Party of Spain|Communists]], and the Frente Nacional on the right, ranging from the centre [[radicalism (historical)|radicals]] to the conservative [[Carlism|Carlists]]. On 16 February 1936 the elections ended in a virtual draw, but in the evening leftist mobs started to interfere in the balloting and in the registration of votes distorting the results{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=108}}&lt;ref&gt;"Riots Sweep Spain on Left's Victory; Jails Are Stormed", ''The New York Times'', 18 February 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Stanley G.

On 19 February the cabinet presided by [[Portela Valladares]] resigned, with a new cabinet composed chiefly of members of the [[Izquierda Republicana|Republican Left]] and the [[Republican Union (Spain, 1934)|Republican Union]] and presided by [[Manuel Azaña]] being quickly set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La izquierda burguesa y la tragedia de la II República|first=Juan|last=Avilés Farré|isbn= 84-451-2881-7|location=Madrid|year=2006|publisher=Consejería de Educación de la Comunidad de Madrid|pages=397–398|url=http://www.madrid.org/bvirtual/BVCM001646.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[José Calvo Sotelo]], who acquired anti-communism as the axis of his parliamentary speeches, became the speaker of violent propaganda—advocating for a military coup d'état; formulating a catastrophist discourse of a dichotomous choice between "communism" or a markedly totalitarian "National" State, setting the mood of the masses for a military rebellion.&lt;ref name=gcalleja /&gt; The diffusion of the myth about an alleged Communist coup d'état as well a pretended state of "social chaos" became pretexts for a coup.&lt;ref name=gcalleja&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Los discursos catastrofistas de los líderes de la derecha y la difusión del mito del "golpe de Estado comunista"|first=Eduardo|last=González Calleja|author-link=Eduardo González Calleja|journal=El Argonauta Español|issue=13|year=2016|url=https://journals.openedition.org/argonauta/2412|doi=10.4000/argonauta.2412|issn=1765-2901|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franco himself along with General [[Emilio Mola]] had stirred an Anti-Communist campaign in Morocco.&lt;ref name=gcalleja /&gt;

At the same time PSOE's left wing socialists became more radical. [[Julio Álvarez del Vayo]] talked about "Spain' being converted into a socialist Republic in association with the Soviet Union". [[Francisco Largo Caballero]] declared that "the organized proletariat will carry everything before it and destroy everything until we reach our goal".{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=100}} The country rapidly descended into anarchy. Even the staunch socialist [[Indalecio Prieto]] at a party rally in Cuenca, in May 1936, complained: "we have never seen so tragic a panorama or so great a collapse as in Spain at this moment. Abroad Spain is classified as insolvent. This is not the road to socialism or communism but to desperat anarchism without even the advantage of liberty".{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=100}}

On 23 February Franco was sent to the [[Canary Islands]] to serve as the islands' military commander, an appointment perceived by him as a ''destierro'' (banishment).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Preston|Preston]], p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a conspiracy led by General Mola was taking shape.

Interested in the parliamentary immunity granted by a seat at the Cortes, Franco intended to stand as candidate of the Right Bloc alongside [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]] for the by-election in the [[province of Cuenca]] programmed for 3 May 1936, after the results of the February 1936 election were annulled in the constituency. But Primo de Rivera refused to run alongside a military officer (and Franco in particular) and Franco himself ultimately desisted on 26 April, one day before the decision of the election authority.&lt;ref name=lopezvillaverde /&gt; By that time, PSOE politician [[Indalecio Prieto]] already deemed Franco as "possible caudillo for a military uprising".&lt;ref name=lopezvillaverde&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Indalecio Prieto en Cuenca: comentarios al discurso pronunciado el 1º de mayo de 1936|first=Ángel Luis|last=López Villaverde|journal=Añil|issn=1133-2263|issue=19|year=1999|page=16|url=http://biblioteca2.uclm.es/biblioteca/CECLM/ARTREVISTAS/A%C3%B1il/A%C3%91IL19_LopezIndalecio.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disenchantment with Azaña's rulling continued to grow and was dramatically voiced by [[Miguel de Unamuno]], a republican and one of Spain's most respected intelectuals, who in June 1936 told a reporter who published his statement in El Adelanto that President [[Manuel Azaña]] should commit suicide as a patriotic act”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1= Rabaté |first1=Jean-Claude|last2= Rabaté |first2=Colette | date=2009 |title=Miguel de Unamuno: Biografía |publisher=TAURUS |language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1936, Franco was contacted and a secret meeting was held within [[El Rosario, Tenerife|La Esperanza forest]] on [[Tenerife]] to discuss starting a military coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/especiales/2006/mirada/fotogaleria_4_3.html |title=Las raíces insulares de Franco (The island roots of Franco) |work=El País |accessdate=15 April 2013 |language=es |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523055841/http://www.elpais.com/especiales/2006/mirada/fotogaleria_4_3.html |archivedate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An obelisk commemorating this historic meeting was erected at the site in a clearing at [[Las Raíces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laopinion.es/tenerife/2008/11/29/monumento-franco-raices-sera-retirado/184903.html|title=El monumento a Franco en Las Raíces será retirado (Monument to Franco's meeting to be removed)|publisher=Laopinion|date=29 September 2008|accessdate=15 April 2013|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outwardly, Franco maintained an ambiguous attitude almost until July. On 23 June 1936, he wrote to the head of the government, [[Casares Quiroga]], offering to quell the discontent in the [[Spanish Republican Army]], but received no reply. The other rebels were determined to go ahead ''con Paquito o sin Paquito'' (with ''Paquito'' or without ''Paquito''; ''Paquito'' being a diminutive of ''Paco'', which in turn is short for ''Francisco''), as it was put by [[José Sanjurjo]], the honorary leader of the military uprising. After various postponements, 18 July was fixed as the date of the uprising. The situation reached a point of no return and, as presented to Franco by Mola, the coup was unavoidable and he had to choose a side. He decided to join the rebels and was given the task of commanding the [[Army of Africa (Spain)|Army of Africa]]. A privately owned DH 89 [[De Havilland Dragon Rapide]], flown by two British pilots, [[Cecil Bebb]] and [[Hugh Pollard (intelligence officer)|Hugh Pollard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/18/post233 |title=article in the Guardian about Cecil Bebb |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=2 March 2010 | date=18 July 2006 | first=David | last=Mathieson}}&lt;/ref&gt; was chartered in England on 11 July to take Franco to Africa.

The coup underway was precipitated by the assassination of the right-wing opposition leader Calvo Sotelo in retaliation for the murder of assault guard [[José Castillo (Spanish Civil War)|José Castillo]], which had been committed by a group headed by a [[Guardia Civil|civil guard]] and composed of [[Guardia de Asalto|assault guards]] and members of the socialist militias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Warfare in Spain |last=Cortada |first=James W. |year=2011 |publisher=Potomac Books, Inc. |isbn=978-1612341019 |page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3_06uUe91o4C&amp;pg=PT43}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 July, one day earlier than planned, the Army of Africa rebelled, detaining their commanders. On 18 July, Franco published a manifesto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.generalisimofranco.com/discurso11.htm |title=Manifesto de las palmas |language=Spanish |accessdate=21 July 2006|date=18 July 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left for Africa, where he arrived the next day to take command.

A week later the rebels, who soon called themselves the ''Nationalists'', controlled a third of Spain; most naval units remained under control of the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] [[Loyalism|loyalist]] forces, which left Franco isolated. The coup had failed in the attempt to bring a swift victory, but the [[Spanish Civil War]] had begun. The revolt was remarkably devoid of any particular ideology.{{sfn|Hayes|1965|p=103}} The major goal was to put an end to anarchical disorder.{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=103}} Franco himself certainly detested communism but had no commitment to any ideology: his stand was motivated not by foreign fascism but by Spanish tradition and patriotism.{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=103}}

== From the Spanish Civil War to World War II ==
{{Main|Spanish Civil War|Spain in World War II}}
[[File:FrancoenReus.jpg|thumb|Franco in [[Reus]], 1940]]
The Spanish Civil War began in July 1936 and officially ended with Franco's victory in April 1939, leaving 190,000&lt;ref&gt;[[Santos Juliá|Juliá, Santos]] (1999). ''Víctimas de la guerra civil'', Madrid, {{ISBN|84-8460-333-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 500,000&lt;ref name="oepcls"&gt;{{cite web|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Spanish-Civil-War |title=Spanish Civil War}}&lt;/ref&gt; dead. Despite the [[Non-Intervention Agreement]] of August 1936, the war was marked by [[Foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War|foreign intervention]] on behalf of both sides, leading to international repercussions. The nationalist side was supported by [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]], which sent the ''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]'', and later by [[Nazi Germany]], which assisted with the [[Condor Legion]]. They were opposed by the [[Soviet Union]] and communists, socialists and anarchists within Spain. The United Kingdom and [[French Third Republic|France]] strictly adhered to the arms embargo,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} provoking dissensions within the [[Popular Front (France)|French Popular Front]] coalition which was led by [[Léon Blum]], but the Republican side was nonetheless supported by the Soviet Union and volunteers who fought in the [[International Brigades]] (see for example [[Ken Loach]]'s ''[[Land and Freedom]]'').

Some historians, such as [[Ernst Nolte]], have considered that [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] used the Spanish Civil war as a testing ground for modern warfare, and that the Spanish Civil War, along with World War II, to be part of a [[European Civil War]] which lasted from 1936 to 1945 and was mainly characterised as a [[left-wing politics|left]]/[[right-wing politics|right]] ideological conflict. This interpretation has not been accepted by most historians, who consider the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War to be two distinct conflicts. Among other things, they point to the political heterogeneity on both sides (''See [[Spanish Civil War#Other factions|Spanish Civil War: other factions]]'') and criticise a monolithic interpretation, which overlooks the local nuances of [[History of Spain|Spanish history]].

=== The first months ===
Following 18 July 1936 ''[[pronunciamiento]]'', Franco assumed the leadership of the 30,000 soldiers of the [[Spanish Army of Africa]]. The first days of the insurgency were marked with a serious need to secure control over the [[Spanish Morocco|Spanish Moroccan Protectorate]]. On one side, Franco had to win the support of the natives and their (nominal) authorities, and, on the other, had to ensure his control over the army. His method was the summary execution of some 200 senior officers loyal to the Republic (one of them his own cousin). His loyal bodyguard was shot by Manuel Blanco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.memoriahistocheeserica.org/alojados/periquete/paginas/noticias1.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170129081724/http://memoriahistocheeserica.org/alojados/periquete/paginas/noticias1.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 29 January 2017 | title = La Memoria de los Nuestros | language = Spanish | accessdate = 21 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franco's first problem was how to move his troops to the [[Iberian Peninsula]], since most units of the Navy had remained in control of the Republic and were blocking the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. He requested help from [[Benito Mussolini]], who responded with an unconditional offer of arms and planes; in Germany [[Wilhelm Canaris]], the head of the ''[[Abwehr]]'' military intelligence, persuaded Hitler to support the Nationalists. From 20 July onward Franco was able, with a small group of 22 mainly German [[Junkers Ju 52]] aircraft, to initiate an [[Airbridge (logistics)|air bridge]] to [[Seville]], where his troops helped to ensure the rebel control of the city. Through representatives, he started to negotiate with the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy for more military support, and above all for more aircraft. Negotiations were successful with the last two on 25 July and aircraft began to arrive in [[Tetouan]] on 2 August. On 5 August Franco was able to break the blockade with the newly arrived air support, successfully deploying a ship convoy with some 2,000 soldiers.

On the Republican side, in July 26, just eight days after the revolt had started, an international communist conference was held at Prague to arrange plans to help the Republican Government. It decide to raise an international brigade of 5,000 men and a fund of 1 billion francs to be administered by a commission where Largo Caballero and [[Dolores Ibárruri]] had prominent roles.{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=115}} At the same time communist parties throughout the world quicly launched a full scale propaganda campaign in support of the Popular Front. The [[Communist International]] immediately refinforced its activity sending to Spain its leader [[Georgi Dimitrov]], and [[Palmiro Togliatti]] the chief of the [[Italian Communist Party|Communist Party of Italy]].{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=117}}{{sfn|Richardson|1969|p=12}} From August onward aid started to be sent from Russia, over one ship per day arrived at Spain's Mediterranean ports carrying munitions, rifles, machine guns, hand grenades, artillery, trucks. With the cargo came Soviet agents, technicians, instructors and propagandists.{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=117}}

The [[Communist International]] immediatelly started to organize the [[International Brigades]] with great care to conceal or minimize the communist character of the enterprise and to make it appear as a campaign on behalf of progressive democracy.{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=117}} Attractive misleading names were deliberately chosen, such as "Garibaldi" in Italy or "Abraham Lincoln" in the United States.{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=117}}

In early August, the situation in western [[Andalusia]] was stable enough to allow Franco to organise a column (some 15,000 men at its height), under the command of then Lieutenant-Colonel [[Juan Yagüe]], which would march through [[Extremadura]] towards Madrid. On 11 August [[Battle of Mérida|Mérida was taken]], and on 15 August [[Battle of Badajoz (1936)|Badajoz]], thus joining both nationalist-controlled areas. Additionally, Mussolini ordered a voluntary army, the ''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]'' (CTV) of some 12,000 Italians of fully motorised units to Seville and Hitler added to them a professional squadron from the [[Luftwaffe]] (2JG/88) with about 24 planes. All these planes had the Nationalist Spanish insignia painted on them, but were flown by Italian and German nationals. The backbone of Franco's aviation in those days were the Italian [[SM.79]] and [[SM.81]] bombers, the biplane Fiat [[CR.32]] fighter and the German [[Junkers Ju 52]] cargo-bomber and the [[Heinkel He 51]] biplane fighter.

On 21 September, with the head of the column at the town of [[Maqueda]] (some 80&amp;nbsp;km away from Madrid), Franco ordered a detour to free the [[Siege of the Alcázar|besieged garrison at the Alcázar]] of [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]], which was achieved on 27 September. This controversial decision gave the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] time to strengthen its defenses in Madrid and hold the city that year, but with Soviet support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennan alleges that, once Stalin had decided to assist the Spanish Republicans, the operation was put in place with remarkable speed and energy. The first load of arms and tanks arrives as early as 26 September and was secretly unloaded at night. Advisers accompanied the armaments. Soviet officers were in effective charge of military operations on the Madrid front. Kennan believes that this operation was originally conducted in good faith with no other purpose than saving the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Russia and the West under Lenin and Stalin|last=Kennan|first=George|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effort was made to encourage the Spanish Communist Party to seize power&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the holding of Alcázar was an important morale and propaganda success for the Nationalists, because it is clear that Hitler's primary aim was not a Franco victory but to prolong the war by the active intervention of the Soviet Government as well as Italy, Britain, and France in the Civil War.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler policy for Spain was shrewd and pragmatic. His instruction were clear: "...''A hundred per cent Franco's victory was not desirable from a German Point of view; rather were we interested in a continuance of the war and in the keeping up of the tension in the Mediterranean.''" Hitler wanted to help Franco just enough to gain his gratitude and to prevent the side supported by the Soviet Union from winning, but not large enough to give the Caudillo a quick victory.{{sfn|Hayes|1955|p=127}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=German Documents Volume 1, Document 19|last=|first=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 1937 the Soviet Union's military help started to taper off, to be replaced by limited economic aid. A more likely motive was Stalin's instinct for self-preservation, because the Spanish Civil War had aroused a spirit of heroism in support of freedom more in line with Trotskyism and such ideas might be exported to the Soviet Union. Further proof of this is what Modin stated that Stalin decided to attack the extreme Left, particularly Trotskyites and militants of the POUM before liquidating Franco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who had served in Spain were tainted in Stalin's view and were singled out for harshness in the purges and were virtually all eliminated. The defector Orlov, who worked for the NKVD in Spain, confirms that he was told by a General, whom Orlov did not want to name, that when the General returned to Moscow to seek further instructions, he was told that the Politburo had adopted a new line towards Spain. Until then, the policy of the Politburo was to assist Republican Spain by supplying armaments, Soviet pilots and tanks to bring about a speedy victory over Franco; but now the Politburo had revised its strategy. Stalin had come to the conclusion that "It would be more advantageous to the Soviet Union if neither of the warring camps gained proponderant strength, and if the war in Spain dragged on as long as possible and thus tied up Hitler for a long time." The Soviet General who informed Orlov of this was shocked by the Machiavellian calculation of the Politburo which, in its desire to obtain time, wanted the Spanish people to bleed as long as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Secret History of Stalin's Crimes|last=Orlov|first=Aleksandr|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1953 Edition p. 238; 1954 Edition p. 244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rise to power ===
The designated leader of the uprising, General [[José Sanjurjo]], died on 20 July 1936, in a plane crash. In the nationalist zone, "political life ceased."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, only military command mattered; this was divided into regional commands ([[Emilio Mola]] in the North, [[Gonzalo Queipo de Llano]] in [[Seville]] commanding [[Andalusia]], Franco with an independent command and [[Miguel Cabanellas]] in [[Zaragoza]] commanding [[Aragon]]). The Spanish Army of Morocco itself was split into two columns, one commanded by General [[Juan Yagüe]] and the other commanded by Colonel [[José Enrique Varela|José Varela]].

From 24 July a coordinating ''[[Military junta|junta]]'' was established, based at [[Burgos]]. Nominally led by Cabanellas, as the most senior general,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 282: "to pacify, rather than to dignify, him."&lt;/ref&gt; it initially included Mola, three other generals, and two colonels; Franco was later added in early August.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 September it was decided that Franco was to be commander-in-chief (this unified command was opposed only by Cabanellas),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 421&lt;/ref&gt; and, after some discussion, with no more than a lukewarm agreement from Queipo de Llano and from Mola, also head of government.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp. 423–424&lt;/ref&gt; He was, doubtlessly, helped to this primacy by the fact that, in late July, Hitler had decided that all of Germany's aid to the nationalists would go to Franco.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 356&lt;/ref&gt;

Mola had been somewhat discredited as the main planner of the attempted coup that had now degenerated into a civil war, and was strongly identified with the [[Carlism|Carlist]] monarchists and not at all with the [[Falange]], a party with Fascist leanings and connections ("phalanx", a far-right Spanish political party founded by [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]]), nor did he have good relations with Germany; Queipo de Llano and Cabanellas had both previously rebelled against the dictatorship of General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and were therefore discredited in some nationalist circles; and Falangist leader José Antonio Primo de Rivera was in prison in [[Alicante]] (he would be executed a few months later) and the desire to keep a place open for him prevented any other Falangist leader from emerging as a possible head of state. Franco's previous aloofness from politics meant that he had few active enemies in any of the factions that needed to be placated, and also he had cooperated in recent months with both Germany and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp. 420–422.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 1936, in [[Burgos]], Franco was publicly proclaimed as ''[[Generalissimo|Generalísimo]]'' of the National army and ''Jefe del Estado'' ([[Head of State]]).&lt;ref name=Thomas424&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt; When Mola was killed in another air accident a year later (which some believe was an assassination) (2 June 1937), no military leader was left from those who organized the conspiracy against the Republic between 1933 and 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp. 689–690.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military command ===
[[File:J mmue 202444 1 00001.jpg|thumb|Franco and other rebel commanders during the Civil War, {{circa|1936–1939}}]]
Franco personally guided military operations from this time until the end of the war. Franco himself was not a strategic genius but he was very effective at organisation, administration, logistics and diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Stanley G., and Jesús Palacios. Franco: A personal and political biography. University of Wisconsin Pres, 2014, p.193&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Siege of Madrid|failed assault on Madrid]] in November 1936, Franco settled on a piecemeal approach to winning the war, rather than bold maneuvering. As with his decision to [[Siege of the Alcázar|relieve the garrison]] at Toledo, this approach has been subject of some debate; some of his decisions, such as in June 1938 when he preferred to head for [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]] instead of [[Catalonia]], remain particularly controversial from a military viewpoint. Valencia, Castellon and Alicante saw the last Republican troops defeated by Franco.

Although both Germany and Italy provided military support to Franco, the degree of influence of both powers on his direction of the war seems to have been very limited. Nevertheless, the Italian troops, despite [[Battle of Guadalajara|not being always effective]], were present in most of the large operations in large numbers, while the German aircraft helped the Nationalist air force dominate the skies for most of the war.

Franco's direction of the German and Italian forces was limited, particularly in the direction of the [[Condor Legion]], but he was by default their supreme commander, and they rarely made decisions on their own. For reasons of prestige it was decided to continue assisting Franco until the end of the war, and Italian and German troops paraded on the day of the final victory in Madrid.&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt;

The Nationalist victory could be accounted for by various factors:&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Stanley G., and Jesús Palacios. Franco: A personal and political biography. University of Wisconsin Pres, 2014, pp.193–195&lt;/ref&gt;
* the reckless policies of the Popular Front government in the weeks prior to the war, where it ignored potential dangers and alienated the opposition, encouraging more people to join the rebellion,
* the superior military cohesion amongst the Nationalists,
* Franco's own leadership, which helped unify the various Nationalist factions, as well as his diplomatic skill, which helped the Nationalists secure military aid from Italy and Germany and keep democracies such as Britain and France out of the war,
* the Nationalists' effective use of a smaller navy; the Nationalists acquired the most powerful ships in the Spanish fleet and maintained an effective officer corp, while the Republican sailors often liquidated their officers. They used their ships aggressively to hunt down the opposition, whilst the Republicans had a largely passive naval strategy,
* the greater foreign aid during the war, as well as more efficient use of foreign aid and effective augmentation of Nationalist forces with captured arms and soldiers from the Republicans,
* the more efficient mobilisation of economic assets,
* the successful integration of a substantial portion of Republican prisoners-of war-into the Nationalist army (proportionately one the greatest out of any army in any 20th-century European civil war),&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, James. "‘Our Red Soldiers’: The Nationalist Army's Management of its Left-Wing Conscripts in the Spanish Civil War 1936–9." Journal of Contemporary History 45, no. 2 (2010): 344–363.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Seidman,[http://www.christiebooks.com/ChristieBooksWP/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Seidman-Victimized-TLS-7-Sep-12.pdf ''Victimized''], ''Times Literary Supplement'', 07.09.12&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Republican disunity and infighting at multiple levels,
* the destructive consequences of the revolution in the Republican zone; mobilisation was impeded, the Republican image was harmed abroad in democracies and the war against religion crystallised massive and unremitting Catholic support for the Nationalists,
* the Nationalists ability to build a larger air force and more effective use of their air force, particularly in supporting ground operations and bombing; the Nationalists also generally enjoyed air superiority from mid-1937 onwards.

=== Political command ===
The Nazis were disappointed with Franco's resistance to installing fascism. Historian James S. Corum states:
:As an ardent Nazi, [Ambassador Wilhelm] Faupel disliked Catholicism as well as the Spanish upper classes, and encouraged the working-class extremist members of the Falange to build a fascist party. Faupel devoted long audiences with Franco to convincing him of the necessity of remolding the Falange in the image of the Nazi Party. Faupel's interference in internal Spanish politics ran counter to Franco's policy of building a nationalist coalition of businessmen, monarchists and conservative Catholics, as well as Falangists.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Corum, "The Luftwaffe and the coalition air war in Spain, 1936–1939," ''Journal of Strategic Studies,'' (1995) 18:1, 68–90 quotation at p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;
Historian Robert H. Whealey provides more detail:
:Whereas Franco's crusade was a counterrevolution, the arrogant Faupel associated the Falange with the "revolutionary" doctrines of National Socialism. He sought to provide Spain's poor with an alternative to "Jewish internationalist Marxist-Leninism.".... The old fashioned Alfonsists and Carlists who surrounded Franco viewed the Falangists as classless troublemakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert H. Whealey|title=Hitler And Spain: The Nazi Role in the Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Do4fBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64|year=2015|page=64|isbn=9780813148632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Francoist demonstration in Salamanca.jpg|thumb|left|Francoist demonstration in Salamanca (1937) with the paraders carrying the portrait of Franco in banners and the populace pulling the [[Roman salute]].]]
From 1937 to 1948 the Franco regime was a hybrid as Franco [[Unification Decree (Spain, 1937)|fused]] the ideologically incompatible national-syndicalist [[Falange]] ("Phalanx", a fascist Spanish political party founded by [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]]) and the [[Carlism|Carlist]] monarchist parties into [[one-party state|one party]] under his rule, dubbed ''[[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista]]'' (FET y de las JONS), which became the only legal party in 1939. Unlike some other fascist movements, the Falangists had developed an official program in 1934, the "Twenty-Seven Points".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Payne|first=Stanley G.|year=1961|title=Falange: A History of Spanish Fascism|publisher=Stanford University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/falangehistoryof00payn|url-access=registration|pages=[https://archive.org/details/falangehistoryof00payn/page/68 68]–69|isbn=9780804700580}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, Franco assumed as the tentative doctrine of his regime 26 out of the original 27 points.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Payne1999|Payne (1999)]], p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; Franco made himself ''jefe nacional'' (National Chief) of the new FET (''Falange Española Tradicionalista''; Traditionalist Spanish Phalanx) with a secretary, Junta Political and National Council to be named subsequently by himself. Five days later (24 April) the raised-arm salute of the Falange was made the official salute of the Nationalist regime.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Payne1987|Payne (1987)]], p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 the personalist style heavily predominated, with ritualistic invocations of "Franco, Franco, Franco."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Payne1987|Payne (1987)]], p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; The Falangists' hymn, ''[[Cara al Sol]]'', became the semi-national anthem of Franco's not-yet-established regime.

This new political formation appeased the pro-German Falangists while tempering them with the anti-German Carlists. Franco's brother-in-law [[Ramón Serrano Súñer]], who was his main political advisor, was able to turn the various parties under Franco against each other to absorb a series of political confrontations against Franco himself. Franco expelled the original leading members of both the Carlists ([[Manuel Fal Condé]]) and the Falangists ([[Manuel Hedilla]]) to secure his political future. Franco also appeased the Carlists by exploiting the Republicans' [[anti-clericalism]] in his propaganda, in particular concerning the "[[Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War|Martyrs of the war]]". While the Republican forces presented the war as a struggle to defend the Republic against Fascism, Franco depicted himself as the defender of "Catholic Spain" against "atheist communism."

=== The end of the Civil War ===
By early 1939 only Madrid (see [[History of Madrid]]) and a few other areas remained under control of the government forces. On 27 February [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain's Britain]] and [[Édouard Daladier|Daladier's France]] officially recognised the Franco regime. On 28 March 1939, with the help of pro-Franco forces inside the city (the "[[fifth column]]" General Mola had mentioned in propaganda broadcasts in 1936), Madrid fell to the Nationalists. The next day, [[Valencia]], which had held out under the guns of the Nationalists for close to two years, also surrendered. Victory was proclaimed on 1 April 1939, when the last of the Republican forces surrendered. On the same day, Franco placed his sword upon the altar of a church and in a vow, promised that he would never again take up his sword unless Spain itself was threatened with invasion.

Although Germany had recognised the Franco Government, Franco's policy towards Germany was extremely cautious until spectacular German victories at the beginning of the Second World War. An early indication that Franco was going to keep his distance from Germany soon proved true'''.'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A rumoured state visit by Franco to Germany did not take place and a further rumour of a visit by Goering to Spain, after he had enjoyed a cruise in the Western Mediterranean, again did not materialise. Instead Goering had to return to Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Survey of International Affairs, 1939 (On the Eve of War) Volume 1|last=|first=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved how right Eden was when he said "Whatever the final outcome of the strife ... the Spanish people will continue to display that proud independence, that arrogant individualism which is a characteristic of the race.

During the Civil War and in the aftermath, a period known as the [[White Terror (Spain)|White Terror]] took place. This saw mass executions of Republican and other Nationalist enemies, standing in contrast to the war-time [[Red Terror (Spain)|Red Terror]]. Historical analysis and investigations estimate the number of executions by the Franco regime during this time to be between 100,000 and 200,000 dead:

According to [[Gabriel Jackson (hispanist)|Gabriel Jackson]] and [[Antony Beevor]], the number of victims of the "White Terror" (executions and hunger or illness in prisons) only between 1939 and 1943 was 200,000.&lt;ref name=jackson&gt;Jackson, Gabriel (1967). ''The Spanish Republic and the Civil War, 1931–1939.'' Princeton University Press. p. 539. {{isbn|0691007578}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beevor "reckons Franco's ensuing 'white terror' claimed 200,000 lives.

Rev. of Antony Beevor, ''The Battle for Spain''. ''The Economist'' (22 June 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Ruiz]] concludes that "although the figures remain disputed, a minimum of 37,843 executions were carried out in the Republican zone with a maximum of 150,000 executions (including 50,000 after the war) in [[Spain under Franco|Nationalist Spain]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0022009407071625| title = Defending the Republic: The Garcia Atadell Brigade in Madrid, 1936| journal = Journal of Contemporary History| volume = 42| page = 97| year = 2007| last1 = Ruiz | first1 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the end of the war, [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla resistance]] to Franco, known as "the ''[[Spanish Maquis|Maquis]]''", occurred in the [[Pyrenees]], carrying out sabotage and robberies against the Francoist regime. Several exiled Republicans also fought in the [[French resistance]] against the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation]] in [[Vichy France]] during [[World War II]]. In 1944, a group of republican veterans from the French resistance [[Invasion of Val d'Aran|invaded the Val d'Aran]] in northwest [[Catalonia]], but were quickly defeated. The activities of the Maquis continued well into the 1950s.

The end of the war led to hundreds of thousands of exiles, [[Immigration in France|mostly to France]] (but also Mexico, Chile, Cuba, the United States and so on).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Caistor |first=Nick |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/2809025.stm |title=Spanish Civil War fighters look back |work=BBC News |date=28 February 2003 |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side of the [[Pyrenees]], [[refugee]]s were confined in [[Concentration camps in France|internment camps]] in [[French Third Republic|France]], such as [[Camp Gurs]] or [[Camp Vernet]], where 12,000 Republicans were housed in squalid conditions (mostly soldiers from the [[Durruti Division]]&lt;ref name="ariege.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cheminsdememoire.gouv.fr/page/afficheLieu.php?idLang=fr&amp;idLieu=2311 |title='Camp Vernet' Website |language=French |publisher=Cheminsdememoire.gouv.fr |accessdate=2 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416211417/http://www.cheminsdememoire.gouv.fr/page/affichelieu.php?idLang=fr&amp;idLieu=2311 |archivedate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The 17,000 refugees housed in Gurs were divided into four categories ([[Brigadist]]s, pilots, ''[[Euzko Gudarostea|Gudaris]]'' and ordinary 'Spaniards'). The ''Gudaris'' (Basques) and the pilots easily found local backers and jobs, and were allowed to quit the camp, but the farmers and ordinary people, who could not find relations in France, were encouraged by the French government, in agreement with the Francoist government, to return to Spain. The great majority did so and were turned over to the Francoist authorities in [[Irún]]. From there they were transferred to the [[Miranda de Ebro]] camp for "purification" according to the [[Law of Political Responsibilities]].

After the proclamation by [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Philippe Pétain]] of the [[Vichy France]] regime, the refugees became political prisoners, and the [[French police]] attempted to round up those who had been liberated from the camp. Along with other "undesirables", they were sent to the [[Drancy internment camp]] before being deported to Nazi Germany. 5,000 Spaniards thus died in [[Mauthausen concentration camp]].&lt;ref name=Cite&gt;[http://www.histoire-immigration.fr/index.php?lg=fr&amp;nav=20&amp;flash=0 Film documentary] on the website of the ''[[Cité nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration]]'' {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chilean poet [[Pablo Neruda]], who had been named by the Chilean President [[Pedro Aguirre Cerda]] special consul for immigration in Paris, was given responsibility for what he called "the noblest mission I have ever undertaken": shipping more than 2,000 Spanish refugees, who had been housed by the French in squalid camps, to Chile on an old cargo ship, the ''[[Winnipeg (boat)|Winnipeg]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redpoppy.net/pablo_neruda.php |title=Pablo Neruda: The Poet's Calling |publisher=Redpoppy.net |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1939 World War II began. On 23 October 1940, Hitler and Franco [[Meeting at Hendaye|met in Hendaye]] in France to discuss the possibility of Spain's entry on the side of the [[Axis Powers|Axis]]. Franco's demands, including supplies of food and fuel, as well as Spanish control of [[Gibraltar]] and [[French North Africa]], proved too much for Hitler. At the time Hitler did not want to risk damaging his relations with the new [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] government. (An oft-cited remark attributed to Hitler is that the German leader said that he would rather have some of his own teeth extracted than to have to personally deal further with Franco.)&lt;ref name=ljoqp,,a&gt;Lochner, Louis P.

Guinness Publishing. {{ISBN|0-85112-519-0}}. p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Franco had received important support from [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]] during the Spanish Civil War, and he had signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]]. He described Spain as part of the Axis in official documents{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}, while offering various kinds of support to Italy and Germany. He allowed Spanish soldiers to volunteer to fight in the German Army against the [[Soviet Union]] (the [[Blue Division]]), but forbade Spaniards to fight in the West against the democracies. Franco's common ground with Hitler was particularly weakened by Hitler's propagation of [[Nazi mysticism]] and his attempts to [[Positive Christianity|manipulate Christianity]], which went against Franco's fervent commitment to defending Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iiipublishing.com/religion/catholic/popes/pius_xi_franco.html |title=Pius XI and the Rise of General Franco |first=William P. |last=Meyers |publisher=III Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contributing to the disagreement was an ongoing dispute over German mining rights in Spain. Some historians argue that Franco made demands he knew Hitler would not accede to, in order to stay out of the war. Other historians argue that Franco, as the leader of a destroyed and bankrupt country in chaos following a brutal three-year civil war, simply had little to offer the Axis and that the Spanish armed forces were not ready for a major war. It has also been suggested that Franco decided not to join the war after the resources he requested from Hitler in October 1940 were not forthcoming.&lt;ref name="rockoff"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/94297/1/2000-08.pdf|title=A Wolfram in Sheep's Clothing: Economic Warfare in Spain and Portugal, 1940–1944|publisher=Econstor|year=2000|last1=Rockoff|first1=Hugh|last2=Caruana|first2=Leonard|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some scholars, after the [[Fall of France]] in June 1940, Spain did adopt a pro-Axis stance (for example, German and Italian ships and U-boats were allowed to use Spanish naval facilities) before returning to a more neutral position in late 1943 when the tide of the war had turned decisively against the Axis Powers, and Italy had changed sides. Franco was initially keen to join the war before the UK was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Preston, Paul |title=Franco and Hitler: The Myth of Hendaye 1940|pages=1–16 (5)|journal=Contemporary European History|volume=1|issue=1|year=1992 |jstor=20081423|doi=10.1017/s0960777300005038|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/26101/1/Franco%20and%20Hitler%28lsero%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Yet Spanish neutrality during world war two was appreciated and publicly acknowledged by leading allied Allied statesmen.{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=151}} In November 1942 President Roosevelt wrote to General Franco: "...your nation and mine are friends in the best sense of the word."{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=152}} In May 1944 Winston Churchill, stated in the House of Commons:"in the dark days of the war the attitude of the Spanish Government in not givin our enemies passage through Spain was extremelly helpful to us...I must say that I shall always consider that a service was rendered...by Spain, not only to the United Kingdom  and to the British Empire and Commonwealth, but to the cause of the United Nations."{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=152}} Similar gratitude was also expressed by the Provisional French Government.{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=152}} Franco interposed no obstable to Britain's construction of a big air base extending out of Gribraltar inot Spanish territorial waters, and it welcomed the Anglo-American landings in North Africa. Moreover, Spain did not intern any of the 1,200 American airmen who forced-landed in the country, but gave them shelter and helped them to leave.{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=152}}

In the winter of 1940–41 Franco toyed with the idea of a "Latin Bloc" formed by Spain, Portugal, Vichy France, the Vatican and Italy, without much consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Lukacs, John (2001). ''The Last European War: September 1939 – December 1941''. Yale University Press, p. 364. {{isbn|0300089155}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Franco had cautiously decided to enter the war on the Axis side in June 1940, and to prepare his people for war, an anti-British and anti-French campaign was launched in the Spanish media that demanded [[French Morocco]], [[Cameroon]] and the return of [[Gibraltar]].&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, Gerhard ''A World in Arms'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 133.&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 June 1940, Franco pressed along a message to Hitler saying he wanted to enter the war, but Hitler was annoyed at Franco's demand for the French colony of Cameroon, which had been German before World War I, and which Hitler was planning on taking back for [[Plan Z]].&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, Gerhard ''A World in Arms'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Franco seriously considered blocking allied access to the Mediterranean Sea by invading British-controlled [[Gibraltar]],&lt;ref name=ljoqp,,a /&gt; but he abandoned the idea after learning that the plan would have likely failed due to Gibraltar being too heavily defended, and it would have given the British the grounds to declare war on Spain and thus give the UK and its allies an excellent opportunity to take both the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Spanish Morocco]], as well as possibly invade mainland Spain itself.&lt;ref name=ljoqp,,a /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6972/is_6_16/ai_n32334981/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708124911/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6972/is_6_16/ai_n32334981/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 July 2012 |title=Franco, Hitler &amp; the play for Gibraltar: how the Spanish held firm on the Rock |first=Murray |last=Sager |publisher=Esprit de Corps |date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franco was aware that his air force would not be able to protect Spanish cities from attacks by the British [[Royal Air Force]], and the British [[Royal Navy]] would be able to blockade Spain to prevent imports of crucial materials such as oil. Spain depended on oil imports from the United States, which were almost certain to be cut off if Spain formally joined the Axis. Franco and Serrano Suñer held a meeting with Mussolini and Ciano in [[Bordighera]], Italy on 12 February 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author-link=|first=David Wingeate|year=2008|last=Pike|page=48|title=Franco and the Axis Stigma|isbn=978-1-349-30089-1|doi=10.1057/9780230205444|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini affected not to be interested in Franco's help due to the defeats his forces had suffered in North Africa and the Balkans, and he even told Franco that he wished he could find any way to leave the war. When the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] began on 22 June 1941, Franco's foreign minister [[Ramón Serrano Suñer]] immediately suggested the formation of a unit of military volunteers to join the invasion.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Volunteer Spanish troops (the ''[[Blue Division|División Azul]]'', or "Blue Division") fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] under German command from 1941 to 1944. Some historians have argued that not all of the Blue Division were true volunteers and that Franco expended relatively small but significant resources to aid the Axis powers' battle against the Soviet Union.

Franco was initially disliked by Cuban President [[Fulgencio Batista]], who, during World War II, suggested a joint U.S.-Latin American declaration of war on Spain to overthrow Franco's regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,802544,00.html|title=Batista's Boost|journal=Time|date=18 January 1943|accessdate =2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler may not have really wanted Spain to join the war, as he needed neutral harbors to import materials from countries in Latin America and elsewhere. In addition Hitler felt Spain would be a burden as it would be dependent on Germany for help. By 1941 Vichy French forces were proving their effectiveness in North Africa, reducing the need for Spanish help, and Hitler was wary about opening up a new front on the western coast of Europe as he struggled to reinforce the Italians in Greece and Yugoslavia. Franco signed a revised [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] on 25 November 1941. Spain continued to import{{clarify|date=January 2020}} war materials{{weasel inline|date=January 2020}} and trade [[Tungsten|wolfram]] with Germany until August 1944 when the Germans withdrew from the Spanish frontier.&lt;ref name="rockoff"/&gt;

After the war, the Spanish government tried to destroy all evidence of its cooperation with the Axis. In 2010 documents were discovered showing that on 13 May 1941, Franco ordered his provincial governors to compile a list of Jews while he negotiated an alliance with the Axis powers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/wwii-document-reveals-general-franco-handed-nazis-list-of-spanish-jews-1.297546|title=WWII document reveals: General Franco handed Nazis list of Spanish Jews|date=22 June 2010|work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franco supplied [[Reichsführer-SS]] Heinrich Himmler, architect of the Nazis' [[Final Solution]], with a list of 6,000 Jews in Spain.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

On 14 June 1940, Spanish forces in Morocco occupied [[Tangier]] (a city under the rule of the [[League of Nations]]) and did not leave it until the war's end in 1945.

After the war, Franco allowed many former Nazis, such as [[Otto Skorzeny]] and [[Léon Degrelle]], and other former Fascists, to flee to Spain.

=== Treatment of Jews ===
According to ''Anti-Semitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution'' (2005):
:Throughout the war, Franco rescued many Jews....Just how many Jews were saved by Franco's government during World War II is a matter of historical controversy. Franco has been credited with saving anywhere from approximately 30,000 to 60,000 Jews; most reliable estimates suggest 45,000 is a likely figure.&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Levy, ed, ''Anti-Semitism: A historical encyclopedia of prejudice and persecution'' (ABC-Clio, 2005, page 675.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain provided visas for thousands of French Jews to transit Spain en route to Portugal to escape the Nazis. Spanish diplomats protected about 4,000 Jews living in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and Austria. At least some 20,000–30,000 Jews were allowed to pass through Spain in the first half of the War. Jews who were not allowed to enter Spain, however, were sent to the Miranda de Ebro concentration camp or deported to [[Vichy France|France]]. In January 1943, after the German embassy in Spain told the Spanish government that it had two months to remove its Jewish citizens from Western Europe, Spain severely limited visas, and only 800 Jews were allowed to enter the country. After the war, Franco exaggerated his contribution to helping to save Jews to end Spain's isolation and to improve Spain's image in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Levy, ed, ''Anti-Semitism'' p. 675.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haim Avni, ''Spain, the Jews, and Franco'' (Jewish Publication Society of America, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Alpert, "Spain and the Jews in the Second World War" ''Jewish Historical Studies'' Vol. 42 (2009), pp. 201–210 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/29780130 online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%206034.pdf Yad Vashem, "Spain"]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Franco refused to recognize Israel as a legitimate state. The regime's propaganda claimed that there was an international conspiracy of Jews, Freemasons, and Communists against Spain.&lt;ref name="Bautista Delgado 2009 299–316"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bautista Delgado|2009|pp=299–316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Francoist regime, Jews, along with other non-Catholic communities, were heavily discriminated against – in 1945, the regime enacted the "Spanish Bill of Rights" (''Fuero de los Españoles''), which allowed the worship of non-Catholic religions; however, worship of non-Catholic religions was only allowed in private, no signs to indicate they were places of worship were allowed, and only Catholic public ceremonies were allowed, making it a huge regression in comparison to the [[Spanish Constitution of 1931|Republican Constitution of 1931]], which granted Jews rights they had not enjoyed in Spain since their [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion in 1492]].&lt;ref name="In the Shadow of the Holocaust and the Inquisition: Israel's Relations with Francoist Spain pp. 17–18"&gt;{{Harvnb|In the Shadow of the Holocaust and the Inquisition: Israel's Relations with Francoist Spain pp. 17–18}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=9ftYfUGw_eQC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=francoist+spain+1945+fuero+de+los+espa%C3%B1oles+jews&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E4gClLgk70&amp;sig=ACfU3U10r9ykTr5sMWz6bg0xOsed7MsPHQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjQ-9DstL3iAhWlA9QKHfTtBb0Q6AEwBHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false online]&lt;/ref&gt; The situation improved with the 1967 Law on Religious Freedom, but discrimination still existed and non-Catholic groups were forced to register with the regime and to provide records of their members.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Contemporary Spanish Culture pp. 337"&gt;{{Harvnb|Encyclopedia of Contemporary Spanish Culture pp. 337}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=EUuEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA337&amp;dq=francoist+spain+1967+law+religion+limited&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj174SZv73iAhUfHLkGHXRRA6gQ6AEIQDAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false online]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 16 December 1968, the regime formally revoked the 1492 [[Alhambra Decree|Edict of Expulsion]] against Spain's Jewish population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/12/17/archives/1492-ban-on-jews-is-voided-by-spain-1492-ban-on-jews-is-voided-in.html|title=1492 Ban on Jews Is Voided by Spain|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=17 December 1968|access-date=15 May 2019|first1=Richard|last1=Ederspecial}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-this-day-spain-lifts-the-expulsion-1.5377424 |title=This Day in Jewish History 1968: Spain Revokes the Expulsion of the Jews |last=Green |first=David |date=6 December 2015 |website=Haaretz |access-date= |quote=Although technically the Inquisition had been dismantled with the passage into law of Spain’s constitution of 1869, which abolished religious discrimination, it was not until this 1968 legislation that the regime of Francisco Franco explicitly invited Jews to come and openly practice their faith in Spain.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of religion would be completely established in Spain in 1978, with the new [[Constitution of Spain]], three years after Franco's death.

Franco was recognized as the Spanish head of state by Great Britain, France and Argentina in February 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2015/11/02/opinion/1446471037_651866.html |title=El último Azaña |first=Santos |last=Juliá |date=3 November 2015 |access-date=3 June 2019 |newspaper=[[El País]] |language=es |publisher=[[Prisa]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.valencia.es/ayuntamiento/publicaciones.nsf/0/F44ECD297CC3E998C125806600414E5C/$FILE/0001%20cronolog%C3%ADa%20general%20de%20la%20guerra%20civil.pdf?OpenElement&amp;lang=2 |title=Cronología general de la Guerra Civil Española (1936–1939) |first=Francisco |last=Pérez Puche |date=October 2016 |access-date=3 June 2019 |page=53 |language=es |journal=Oficina de Publicacinoes |publisher=Ajuntament de València}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already proclaimed ''[[Generalísimo]]'' of the Nationalists and ''Jefe del Estado'' ([[Head of State]]) in October 1936,&lt;ref name=Thomas424/&gt; he thereafter assumed the official title of "''Su Excelencia el Jefe de Estado''" ("His Excellency the Head of State"). He was also referred to in state and official documents as "''[[Caudillo]] de España''" ("the Leader of Spain"), and sometimes called "''el Caudillo de la Última Cruzada y de la Hispanidad''" ("the Leader of the Last [[Crusade]] and of the Hispanic heritage") and "''el Caudillo de la Guerra de Liberación contra el Comunismo y sus Cómplices''" ("the Leader of the War of Liberation Against Communism and Its Accomplices").

On paper, Franco had more power than any Spanish leader before or since. For the first four years after taking Madrid, he ruled almost exclusively by decree. The "Law of the Head of State," passed in August 1939, "permanently confided" all governing power to Franco; he was not required to even consult the cabinet for most legislation or decrees.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Payne (1987)|Payne(1987)]], p. 231-234.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Payne, Franco possessed far more day-to-day power than Hitler or Stalin possessed at the respective heights of their power. He noted that while Hitler and Stalin maintained rubber-stamp parliaments, this was not the case in Spain in the early years after the war–a situation that nominally made Franco's regime "the most purely arbitrary in the world."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Payne (1987)|Payne(1987)]], p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

This changed in 1942, when Franco convened a parliament known as the [[Cortes Españolas]]. It was elected in accordance with corporatist principles, and had little real power. Notably, it had no control over government spending, and the government was not responsible to it; ministers were appointed and dismissed by Franco alone.

On 26 July 1947 Franco proclaimed Spain a monarchy, but did not designate a monarch. This gesture was largely done to appease the monarchists in the ''[[Movimiento Nacional]]'' ([[Carlism|Carlists]] and [[Legitimism|Alfonsists]]). Franco left the throne vacant until 1969, proclaiming himself as a ''de facto'' [[regent]] for life. At the same time, Franco appropriated many of the privileges of a king. He wore the uniform of a [[Captain General]] (a rank traditionally reserved for the King) and resided in [[Royal Palace of El Pardo|El Pardo Palace]]. In addition he began walking under a [[baldachin|canopy]], and his portrait appeared on most [[Spanish coins]] and postage stamps. He also added "[[by the grace of God]]", a phrase usually part of the styles of monarchs, to his style.

Franco initially sought support from various groups. His administration marginalised fascist ideologues in favor of [[technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]], many of whom were linked with [[Opus Dei]], who promoted economic modernisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html#es0034 |title=The Franco Years: Policies, Programs, and Growing Popular Unrest |work=A Country Study: Spain |publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Franco eisenhower 1959 madrid.jpg|thumb|left|Franco with U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in Madrid, December 1959]]

Although Franco and Spain under his rule adopted some trappings of fascism, he, and Spain under his rule, are generally not considered to be fascist; among the distinctions, fascism entails a revolutionary aim to transform society, where Franco did not seek to do so, and, to the contrary, although authoritarian, he was by nature conservative and traditional.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Laqueur, Walter (1996) [https://archive.org/details/fascismpastprese00laqu ''Fascism: Past, Present, Future''].

With the end of World War II, Spain suffered from the consequences of its isolation from the international economy.

This situation ended in part when, in the light of [[Cold War]] tensions and of Spain's strategic location, the United States of America entered into a trade and military alliance with Franco.

The first decade of Franco's rule following the end of the Civil War in 1939 saw continued repression and the killing of an undetermined number of political opponents. Estimation is difficult and controversial, [[#The end of the Civil War|but the total number of people who were killed during this period probably lies somewhere between 15,000 and 50,000]].

By the start of the 1950s Franco's state had become less violent, but during his entire rule, non-government trade unions and all political opponents across the [[political spectrum]], from [[Communism|communist]] and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] organisations to [[liberal democracy|liberal democrats]] and [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan]] or [[Basque nationalism|Basque]] separatists, were either suppressed or tightly controlled with all means, up to and including violent police repression. The ''[[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]]'' (CNT) and the ''[[Unión General de Trabajadores]]'' (UGT) trade unions were outlawed, and replaced in 1940 by the corporatist ''[[Sindicato Vertical]]''. The [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] and the ''[[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]]'' (ERC) were banned in 1939, while the [[Communist Party of Spain]] (PCE) went underground. The [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV) went into exile, and in 1959 the [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] armed group was created to wage a [[low-intensity warfare|low-intensity war]] against Franco.

Franco's Spanish nationalism promoted a unitary national identity by repressing Spain's cultural diversity. [[Bullfighting]] and [[flamenco]]&lt;ref&gt;Roman, Mar (27 October 2007). [https://web.archive.org/web/20170129082010/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20071027/flamenco-for-foreigners/ "Spain frets over future of flamenco."] Associated Press.&lt;/ref&gt; were promoted as national traditions while those traditions not considered "Spanish" were suppressed. Franco's view of Spanish tradition was somewhat artificial and arbitrary: while some regional traditions were suppressed, [[Flamenco]], an [[Andalusia]]n tradition, was considered part of a larger, national identity. All cultural activities were subject to censorship, and many, such as the [[Sardana]], the national dance of [[Catalonia]], were plainly forbidden (often in an erratic manner). This cultural policy was relaxed over time, most notably during the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Franco also used [[Language policies of Francoist Spain|language politics]] in an attempt to establish national homogeneity. He promoted the use of [[Castilian Spanish]] and suppressed other languages such as [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician language|Galician]], and [[Basque language|Basque]]. The legal usage of languages other than Castilian was forbidden. All government, notarial, legal and commercial documents were to be drawn up exclusively in Castilian and any documents written in other languages were deemed null and void. The usage of any other language was forbidden in schools, in advertising, and on road and shop signs. For unofficial use, citizens continued to speak these languages. This was the situation throughout the 1940s and to a lesser extent during the 1950s, but after 1960 the non-Castilian Spanish languages were freely spoken and written, and they reached bookshops and stages, although they never received official status.

The [[Catholic Church]] was upheld as the [[established church]] of the Spanish State, and it regained many of the traditional privileges which it had lost under the Republic. Civil servants had to be Catholic, and some official jobs even required a "good behavior" statement by a priest. Civil marriages which had taken place in Republican Spain were declared null and void unless they had been confirmed by the Catholic Church. Divorce was forbidden, along with [[Birth control|contraceptives]], and abortion.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

Most country towns and rural areas were patrolled by pairs of ''[[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]]'', a military police force for civilians, which functioned as Franco's chief means of social control. Larger cities and capitals were mostly under the jurisdiction of the [[Policia Armada]], or the ''[[grises]]'' ("greys", due to the colour of their uniforms) as they were called.

Student revolts at universities in the late 1960s and early 1970s were violently repressed by the heavily armed ''Policía Armada'' (Armed Police). Plain-clothed secret police worked inside Spanish universities.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The enforcement by public authorities of traditional [[Catholic social teaching|Catholic values]] was a stated intent of the regime, mainly by using a law (the ''Ley de Vagos y Maleantes'', Vagrancy Act) enacted by [[Manuel Azaña|Azaña]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/tifs.php?coleccion=gazeta&amp;anyo=1933&amp;nbo=217&amp;lim=A&amp;pub=BOE&amp;pco=874&amp;pfi=877 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012090326/http://search.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/tifs.php?coleccion=gazeta&amp;anyo=1933&amp;nbo=217&amp;lim=A&amp;pub=BOE&amp;pco=874&amp;pfi=877 |archivedate=12 October 2007 |title=Gazeta histórica: Referencia: Páginas TIFF |publisher=Boletín Oficial del Estado |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining nomads of Spain ([[Romani people in Spain|Gitanos]] and [[Merchero]]s like [[Eleuterio Sánchez|El Lute]]) were especially affected.

=== Women in Francoist Spain ===
[[File:Francisco Franco and Carmen Polo.jpg|thumb|Franco and his wife, [[Carmen Polo, 1st Lady of Meirás|Carmen Polo]], in 1968]]
Francoism professed a devotion to the traditional role of a woman in society, that is being a loving daughter and sister to her parents and brothers, being a faithful wife to her husband, and residing with her family. Official propaganda confined the role of women to family care and motherhood. Immediately after the civil war most progressive laws passed by the Republic aimed at equality between the sexes were nullified. Women could not become judges, or testify in a trial. They could not become university professors. Their affairs and economic lives had to be managed by their fathers and husbands. Until the 1970s women could not open a bank account without having it [[Loan guarantee|co-signed]] by her father or husband.&lt;ref&gt;Tremlett, Giles (2006). ''Ghosts of Spain''. Faber and Faber Ltd. London. {{ISBN|0802716741}}. p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s these restrictions were somewhat relaxed.

=== The Spanish colonies and decolonisation ===
{{Further|Spanish Empire}}
Spain attempted to retain control of its colonies throughout Franco's rule. During the [[Algerian War]] (1954–62), Madrid became the base of the ''[[Organisation armée secrète]]'' (OAS), a right-wing French Army group which sought to preserve [[French rule in Algeria|French Algeria]]. Despite this, Franco was forced to make some concessions. When [[French Morocco]] became independent in 1956, he surrendered [[Spanish Morocco]] to Morocco, retaining only a few enclaves (the ''[[Plazas de soberanía]]''). The year after, Mohammed V invaded [[Spanish Sahara]] during the [[Ifni War]] (known as the "Forgotten War" in Spain). Only in 1975, with the [[Green March]], did Morocco take control of all of the former Spanish territories in the Sahara.

In 1968, under pressure from the United Nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campos|first1=Alicia|title=The Decolonization of Equatorial Guinea: The Relevance of the International Factor|journal=The Journal of African History|year=2003|volume=44|issue=1|pages=95–116|doi=10.1017/s0021853702008319|hdl=10486/690991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain granted [[Equatorial Guinea]] its independence, and the following year it ceded [[Ifni]] to Morocco. Under Franco, Spain also pursued a campaign to force a negotiation on the [[British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]], and [[Disputed status of Gibraltar|closed its border with that territory]] in 1969. The border would not be fully reopened until 1985.

=== Economic policy ===
{{See also|Economic history of Spain#The Franco Era, 1939-75|l1=Economic history of Spain: Economy under Franco}}
The Civil War ravaged the Spanish economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collier|first1=Paul|s2cid=18408517|title=On the economic consequences of civil war|journal=Oxford Economic Papers |volume=51|year=1999|pages=168–183|doi=10.1093/oep/51.1.168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed, and daily business severely hampered. For more than a decade after Franco's victory, the devastated economy recovered very slowly. Franco initially pursued a policy of [[autarky]], cutting off almost all international trade. The policy had devastating effects, and the economy stagnated. Only black marketeers could enjoy an evident affluence.

[[File:Spanish peseta coin with Franco 1963.gif|thumb|left|1963 [[Spanish peseta]] coin with an image of Franco and lettering reading: "Francisco Franco, Leader of Spain, by the grace of God"]]
On the brink of bankruptcy, a combination of pressure from the United States and the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] managed to convince the regime to adopt a free market economy. Many of the old guard in charge of the economy were replaced by "technocrata", despite some initial opposition from Franco. From the mid-1950s there was modest acceleration in economic activity after some minor reforms and a relaxation of controls. But the growth proved too much for the economy, with shortages and inflation breaking out towards the end of the 1950s.

When Franco replaced his ideological ministers with the apolitical technocrats, the regime implemented several development policies that included deep economic reforms. After a recession, growth took off from 1959, creating an economic boom that lasted until 1974, and became known as the "[[Spanish miracle]]".

Concurrent with the absence of social reforms, and the economic power shift, a tide of mass emigration commenced to other European countries, and to a lesser extent, to South America. Emigration helped the regime in two ways. The country got rid of populations it would not have been able to keep in employment, and the emigrants supplied the country with much needed monetary remittances.

During the 1960s, the wealthy classes of Francoist Spain experienced further increases in wealth, particularly those who remained politically faithful, while a burgeoning middle class became visible as the "economic miracle" progressed. International firms established factories in Spain where salaries were low, company taxes very low, strikes forbidden and workers' health or state protections almost unheard of. State-owned firms like the car manufacturer [[SEAT]], truck builder [[Pegaso]] and oil refiner INH, massively expanded production. Furthermore, Spain was virtually a new mass market. Spain became the second-fastest growing economy in the world between 1959 and 1973, just behind Japan. By the time of Franco's death in 1975, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe but the gap between its per capita GDP and that of the leading Western European countries had narrowed greatly, and the country had developed a large industrialised economy.

== Succession ==
[[File:In Madrid is herdacht dat Franco 30 jaar geleden de burgeroorlog ( 1936 1939 ) w, Bestanddeelnr 922-4913 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Franco with Prince [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]] in 1969]]
Franco decided to name a monarch to succeed his regency but the simmering tensions between the [[Carlists]] and the Alfonsoists continued. In a bid to avoid a repeat of the [[Carlist Wars]], he offered the throne to the [[Habsburg]] Archduke [[Otto von Habsburg]]; by doing so he believed that he could eliminate the question of a [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] succession entirely since the Habsburg family which had ruled the [[Habsburg Spain]] during its golden age had an alternate claim to the Spanish throne before the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. Archduke Otto declined, stating that he would be seen as a German ruling Spain and could never forget his Austrian identity. In 1969 Franco nominated as his heir-apparent Prince [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos de Borbón]], who had been educated by him in Spain, with the new title of Prince of Spain. This designation came as a surprise to the [[Carlism|Carlist]] pretender to the throne, as well as to Juan Carlos's father, [[Juan de Borbón|Don Juan, the Count of Barcelona]], who had a superior claim to the throne, but whom Franco feared to be too liberal.

By 1973 Franco had surrendered the function of prime minister (''Presidente del Gobierno''), remaining only as head of state and commander in chief of the military.

As his final years progressed, tensions within the various factions of the ''Movimiento'' would consume Spanish political life, as varying groups jockeyed for position in an effort to win control of the country's future. The assassination of prime minister [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] in the [[Assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco|20 December 1973 bombing]] by [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] eventually gave an edge to the liberalizing faction.

== Death and funeral ==
[[File:Carlos Arias Navarro and Franco 1975.jpg|right|thumb|[[Carlos Arias Navarro]] and Franco at his residence in October 1975, around one week before he fell into an irreversible coma]]
On 19 July 1974, the aged Franco fell ill from various health problems, and Juan Carlos took over as acting head of state. Franco soon recovered and on 2 September he resumed his duties as head of state. A year later he fell ill again, afflicted with further health problems, including a long battle with [[Parkinson's disease]]. Franco's last public appearance was on 1 October 1975 when, despite his gaunt and frail appearance, he gave a speech to crowds from the balcony at the Royal Palace of El Pardo in Madrid. On 30 October 1975 he fell into a coma and was put on [[life support]]. Franco's family agreed to disconnect the life-support machines. Officially, he died a few minutes after midnight on 20 November 1975 from heart failure, at the age of 82 – on the same date as the death of [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]], the founder of the [[Falange]]. Historian [[Ricardo de la Cierva]] claimed that he had been told around 6&amp;nbsp;pm on 19 November that Franco had already died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=de la Cierva |first=Ricardo|authorlink=Ricardo de la Cierva|title=Agonia y Muerte de Franco|language=Spanish|trans-title=Agony and Death of Franco|publisher=Eudema Universidad|date=1996 |pages=|chapter=|isbn=9788477542179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juan Carlos was proclaimed King two days later.

Franco's body was interred at [[Valle de los Caídos]], a colossal memorial built by the forced labour of [[political prisoner]]s to honour the casualties of both sides of the Spanish Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.elindependiente.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/informe_expertos_valle_caidos.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE//1957/226/A00834-00835.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The site was designated by the interim Government, assured by Prince [[Juan Carlos]] and Prime Minister [[Carlos Arias Navarro]], as the burial place for Franco. According to his family, Franco did not want to be buried in the Valley, but in the [[Almudena Cathedral]] in Madrid. Nonetheless, the family agreed to the interim Government's request to bury him in the Valley, and has stood by the decision. This made Franco the only person interred in the Valley who did not die during the civil war.

No Western European countries sent their leaders to attend Franco's funeral due to his tenure as dictator. The following guests took part in his funeral:

==Exhumation==
On 11 May 2017, the [[Congress of Deputies]] approved, by 198–1 with 140 abstentions, a motion driven by the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Workers' Party]] ordering the [[Government of Spain|Government]] to [[exhume]] Franco's remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elmundo.es/espana/2017/05/11/5914457c22601dbc1d8b45df.html|title=El Congreso aprueba pedir al Gobierno la exhumación de los restos de Franco del Valle de los Caídos|date=11 May 2017|website=ELMUNDO|language=es|access-date=15 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 August 2018, the [[Sánchez I Government|Government]] of Prime Minister [[Pedro Sánchez (politician)|Pedro Sánchez]] approved legal amendments to the [[Historical Memory Law]] stating that only those who died during the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] would be buried at the Valle de los Caídos, resulting in plans to exhume Franco's remains for reburial elsewhere. Deputy Prime Minister [[Carmen Calvo Poyato]] stated that having Franco buried at the monument "shows a lack of respect ... for the victims buried there". The government gave Franco's family a 15-day deadline to decide Franco's final resting place, or else a "dignified place" will be chosen by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/general-franco-valley-fallen-spain-body-exhumed-fascist-dictator-a8506541.html|title=Spain to dig up Franco's body after government passes decree|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=24 August 2018|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 2018, the [[Congress of Deputies]] voted 176–2, with 165 abstentions, to approve the government's plan to remove Franco's body from the monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-franco/spanish-parliament-votes-to-exhume-remains-of-dictator-franco-idUSKCN1LT2C9 |title=Spanish parliament votes to exhume remains of dictator Franco |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=13 September 2018 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franco's family opposed the exhumation, and attempted to prevent it by making appeals to the [[Spanish Ombudsman|Ombudsman's Office]]. The family expressed its wish that Franco's remains be reinterred with full military honors at the [[Almudena Cathedral]] in the centre of [[Madrid]], the burial place he had requested before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/10/02/inenglish/1538471266_523006.html|title=Franco's family demands dictator be buried with military honors|last=Junquera|first=Natalia|date=3 October 2018|work=El País|access-date=15 March 2019|issn=1134-6582}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demand was rejected by the Spanish Government, which issued another 15-day deadline to choose another site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/17/europe/spain-government-franco-exhumation-deadline-intl/index.html|title=Spanish government gives Franco family ultimatum in effort to exhume dictator's remains|author=Rob Picheta|publisher=CNN|access-date=15 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the family refused to choose another location, the Spanish Government ultimately chose to rebury Franco at the [[Mingorrubio Cemetery]] in [[El Pardo]], where his wife Carmen Polo and a number of Francoist officials, most notably prime ministers [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] and [[Carlos Arias Navarro]], are buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.eldiario.es/politica/Mingorrubio-franquista-Franco-Valle-Caidos_0_878062911.html|journal=[[eldiario.es]]|title=Mingorrubio, la antigua colonia franquista donde se enterraría a Franco: "No queremos ser el Valle de los Caídos"|date=15 March 2019|first=Analía|last=Plaza}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was to be exhumed from the Valle de los Caídos on 10 June 2019, but the Supreme Court of Spain ruled that the exhumation would be delayed until the family has exhausted all possible appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/06/10/inenglish/1560170915_878153.html|title=Spain's Supreme Court suspends the planned exhumation of Franco|date=4 June 2019|website=El Pais|access-date=30 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 September 2019, the Supreme Court ruled that the exhumation could proceed, and the Sánchez government announced that it would move Franco's remains to the Mingorrubio cemetery as soon as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/24/franco-body-moved-burial-site-spain-court|title=Spain to move Franco's remains after court gives go-ahead|website=The Guardian|date=24 September 2019|access-date=25 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 October 2019 his remains were moved to his wife's mausoleum which is located in the Mingorrubio Cemetery, and buried in a private ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/23/francos-remains-to-finally-leave-spains-valley-of-the-fallen | title=Franco's remains to finally leave Spain's Valley of the Fallen | date=23 October 2019 | newspaper=The Guardian | location=UK | first=Sam | last=Jone | accessdate=24 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though barred by the Spanish government from being draped in the Spanish flag, Francisco Franco's grandson, also named Francisco Franco, draped his coffin in the nationalist flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-franco-idUSKBN1X22QW|title=Confronting its troubled past, Spain exhumes Franco|date=24 October 2019|agency=Reuters|access-date=26 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a poll by the Spanish newspaper, El Mundo, 43% of Spanish people approved of the exhumation while 32.5% opposed it. The exhumation also seems to have been an opinion divided by party line with the Socialist party strongly in favor of its removal as well as the removal of his statue there. There seems to be no consensus on whether the statue should simply be moved or completely destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-franco-reactions-factb-idUSKBN1X31EO|title=Factbox: Reactions to Spain's exhumation of former dictator Franco|date=24 October 2019|agency=Reuters|access-date=26 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain and abroad, the legacy of Franco remains controversial. The longevity of Franco's rule, his suppression of opposition, and the effective propaganda sustained through the years have made a detached evaluation difficult. For almost 40 years, Spaniards, and particularly children at school, were told that Divine Providence had sent Franco to save Spain from chaos, atheism, and poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mahamud|first= Kira | title= Emotional indoctrination through sentimental narrative in Spanish primary education textbooks during the Franco dictatorship (1939–1959) |journal=[[History of Education Quarterly]]|volume=45|issue=5|pages=653–678| date=March 2016|doi= 10.1080/0046760X.2015.1101168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Stanley Payne described Franco as being the most significant figure to dominate Spain since [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]],&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Stanley G., and Jesús Palacios.

"Victorious Counterrevolution: The Nationalist Effort in the Spanish Civil War." National Identities (2019), p.254&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly controversial figure within Spain, Franco is seen as a divisive leader. Supporters credit him for keeping Spain neutral and uninvaded in World War II. They emphasize his strong anti-communist and nationalist views, economic policies, and opposition to socialism as major factors in Spain's post-war economic success and later international integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley G.

Conversely, critics on the [[Left-wing politics|left]] have denounced him as a tyrant responsible for thousands of deaths in years-long political repression, and have called him complicit in atrocities committed by Axis forces during World War II due to his support of Axis governments.

When he died in 1975, the major parties of the left and the right agreed to follow the "Pact of Forgetting." To secure the transition to democracy, they agreed not to have investigations or prosecutions dealing with the civil war or Franco. The agreement effectively lapsed after 2000, the year the [[Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory]] was founded and the public debate started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palmer|first= Alex W. | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-08-03/news/0608030227_1_spanish-civil-war-generalissimo-francisco-franco-international-brigades| title= The Battle Over the Memory of the Spanish Civil War |journal=[[Smithsonian Magazine]]|volume=49|issue=4|page=12 | date=July 2006|accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a poll indicated that almost two-thirds of Spaniards favored a "fresh investigation into the war."&lt;ref name=fresh&gt;{{cite news|last=Hundley|first= Tom | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-08-03/news/0608030227_1_spanish-civil-war-generalissimo-francisco-franco-international-brigades| title=Spain handles with care memories of its civil war | newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=3 August 2006|accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franco served as a role model for several [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] dictators in South America. [[Augusto Pinochet]] is known to have admired Franco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cedéo Alvarado |first=Ernesto |date=4 February 2008 |title=Rey Juan Carlos abochornó a Pinochet |url=http://www.panamaamerica.com.pa/content/rey-juan-carlos-abochorn%C3%B3-pinochet |newspaper=Panamá América |access-date=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, as recently as 2006, Franco supporters in Spain have honored Pinochet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pank |first=Philip |date=18 October 2013 |title=Viudos de Franco homenajearon a Pinochet en España|url=http://www.lacuarta.com/diario/2007/01/12/12.14.4a.VUE.VIUDOS.html |url-status=dead |work=[[La Cuarta]] | language=Spanish|trans-title=Widows of Franco honor Pinocher in Spain | location=Chile|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205083046/http://www.lacuarta.com/diario/2007/01/12/12.14.4a.VUE.VIUDOS.html|archivedate=5 February 2015 |access-date=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[BBC]] reported that [[Maciej Giertych]], an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] of the clerical-nationalist [[League of Polish Families]], had expressed admiration for Franco, stating that the Spanish leader "guaranteed the maintenance of traditional values in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5151504.stm Europe diary: Franco and Finland], [[BBC News]], 6 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Spaniards who suffered under Franco's rule have sought to remove memorials of his regime. Most government buildings and streets that were named after Franco during his rule have been reverted to their original names. Owing to Franco's human-rights record, the Spanish government in 2007 banned all official public references to the Franco regime and began the removal of all statues, street names and memorials associated with the regime, with the last statue reportedly being removed in 2008 in the city of Santander.&lt;ref name=Statue&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Santander/retira/estatua/Franco/elpepuesp/20081218elpepunac_2/Tes ''Santander retira la estatua de Franco''], [[El País]], 18 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Churches that retain plaques commemorating Franco and the [[Red Terror (Spain)|victims]] of his Republican opponents may lose state aid.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/18/spain.paulhamilos |title=Rallies banned at Franco's mausoleum |accessdate=3 January 2010 |work=The Guardian |location=UK | first=Paul | last=Hamilos | date=19 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1978, the national anthem of Spain, the ''[[Marcha Real]]'', does not include lyrics introduced by Franco. Attempts to give the national anthem new lyrics have failed due to lack of consensus.

In March 2006, the Permanent Commission of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe unanimously adopted a resolution "firmly" condemning the "multiple and serious violations" of human rights committed in Spain under the Francoist regime from 1939 to 1975.&lt;ref name=EP&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/03/17/espana/1142617936.html ''Primera condena al régimen de Franco en un recinto internacional''], [[EFE]], ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'', 17 March 2006 {{in lang|es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Martyna Czarnowska, [http://www.wienerzeitung.at/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=4399&amp;Alias=Dossiers&amp;cob=189475&amp;DosCob=164869 Almunia, Joaquin: EU-Kommission (4): ''Ein halbes Jahr Vorsprung''], ''Weiner Zeitung'', 17 February 2005 (German).

In Spain, a commission to "repair the dignity" and "restore the memory" of the "victims of Francoism" (''Comisión para reparar la dignidad y restituir la memoria de las víctimas del franquismo'') was approved in 2004, and is directed by the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|socialist]] deputy Prime Minister [[María Teresa Fernández de la Vega]].&lt;ref name=EP/&gt;

[[File:Plaque franco.jpg|thumb|Sign in [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] for a street bearing Franco's name which was renamed in 2008 Rambla de Santa Cruz.]]
Recently the [[Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory]] (ARHM) initiated a systematic search for mass graves of people executed during Franco's regime, which has been supported since the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]]'s (PSOE) victory during the [[2004 Spanish general election|2004 elections]] by [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]]'s government. A ''Ley de la memoria histórica de España'' ([[Historical Memory Law|Law on the Historical Memory of Spain]]) was approved on 28 July 2006, by the [[Council of Ministers of Spain (8th Legislature)|Council of Ministers]],&lt;ref&gt;"Spain OKs Reparations to Civil War Victims", Associated Press, 28 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; but it took until 31 October 2007, for the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]] to approve an amended version as "The Bill to recognise and extend rights and to establish measures in favour of those who suffered persecution or violence during the Civil War and the Dictatorship" (in common parlance still known as Law of Historical Memory).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eumed.net/entelequia/pdf/2008/e07a19.pdf Politics As Usual?

Official endeavors to preserve the historical memory of the Franco regime include exhibitions like the one the Museu d'Història de Catalunya (Museum of Catalan History) organised around the prison experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.en.mhcat.cat/content/view/full/1768 Franco's Prisons]. The Museum maintains a permanent online version of the exhibition titled [http://www.en.mhcat.cat/layout/set/presons/content/view/full/1175 Les Presons de Franco]&lt;/ref&gt;

The accumulated wealth of Franco's family (including much real estate inherited from Franco, such as the ''[[Pazo de Meirás]]'', the ''[[Palace of Canto del Pico (Torrelodones)|Canto del Pico]]'' in [[Torrelodones]] and the ''{{ill|Casa Cornide|es}}'' in [[A Coruña]]&lt;ref name=Cosecha/&gt;), and its provenance, have also become matters of public discussion. Estimates of the family's wealth have ranged from 350&amp;nbsp;million to 600&amp;nbsp;million euros.&lt;ref name=Cosecha/&gt; While Franco was dying, the [[Francoist Cortes]] voted a large [[Pension|public pension]] for his wife [[Carmen Polo]], which the later democratic governments kept paying. At the time of her death in 1988, Carmen Polo was receiving as a pension more than 12.5&amp;nbsp;million [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] (four million more than the salary of [[Felipe González]], then head of the government).&lt;ref name=Cosecha&gt;Gomez, Luis and Galaz, Mabel (9 September 2007) [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/reportajes/cosecha/dictador/elpepusocdmg/20070909elpdmgrep_1/Tes ''La cosecha del dictador]'', ''[[El País]]'', {{in lang|es}}&lt;/ref&gt;
