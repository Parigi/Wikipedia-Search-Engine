"'''DNA'''" is a song by British [[girl group]] [[Little Mix]] from their 2012 [[DNA (Little Mix album)|debut studio album of the same name]]. The song was written by the group members, production team [[TMS (production team)|TMS]] and songwriter [[Iain James]], and was inspired by the band's performance of [[Katy Perry]]'s 2010 single "[[E.T. (song)|E.T.]]" as contestants on [[The X Factor (UK series 8)|the eighth UK series]] of the British television talent show ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]''. "DNA" is a mid-tempo [[electropop]] and [[Synth-pop|techno-pop]] track featuring eerie [[Synthesizer|synths]], a [[music box]] introduction, spoken-word [[middle eight]] and elements of [[dubstep]]. The lyrics stem from the group members' experiences with love, and have a theme of obsession.

Released as the album's second single on 9 November 2012, "DNA" debuted at number three on the [[UK Singles Chart]], making it the band's third successive single to chart in the top three. It also reached the top 10 in Ireland and Hungary, and charted at number 14 on the US [[Bubbling Under Hot 100]]. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its synth production and choral interlude. 

The track's music video was directed by [[Sarah Chatfield]] and portrays the group as assassins who stalk and kidnap a man, inspired by the comic books ''[[Sin City]]'' and ''[[Watchmen]]''. Little Mix promoted "DNA" with televised performances on ''[[Loose Women]]'', ''[[T4 (Channel 4)|T4]]'', and [[The X Factor (UK series 9)|the ninth UK series]] of ''The X Factor''. The song was performed as part of four of the group's concert tours, including [[The Glory Days Tour]] in 2017.

==Background==
Little Mix co-wrote "DNA" with production team [[TMS (production team)|TMS]], and songwriter [[Iain James]].&lt;ref name="Notes"/&gt; The song was inspired by the group members' personal experiences with love; Perrie Edwards said the group "perform better when the lyrics mean something to [them] when [they] sing them."&lt;ref name="Seventeen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/g331/little-mix/|title=17 Minutes With Little Mix|last=Laurence|first=Emily|website=[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]|date=14 January 2013|accessdate=11 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306042838/https://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/g331/little-mix/|archive-date=6 March 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was intended as a darker and more mature contrast to the group's previous single "[[Wings (Little Mix song)|Wings]]", in a style akin to their 2011 performance of [[Katy Perry]]'s "[[E.T. (song)|E.T.]]" on the [[The X Factor (UK series 8)|eighth UK series]] of the British television talent show ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/blackberry/p.html?id=2191107|title=Little Mix Talk 'DNA', Gaining Respect And Why 'Being A Girl Is Hard' (Interview)|last=Dean|first=Sarah|website=[[HuffPost]]|date=26 November 2012|accessdate=5 May 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GQdzqKCQ?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/blackberry/p.html?id=2191107|archivedate=7 May 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesy Nelson said, "'Wings' was very upbeat and fun and colourful, and we wanted to show how versatile we were".&lt;ref name="Jesy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.popjustice.com/articles/an-interview-with-jesy-from-little-mix/104446/|title=An interview with Jesy from Little Mix|last=O'Mance|first=Brad|website=[[Popjustice]]|date=23 November 2012|accessdate=11 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306042921/https://www.popjustice.com/articles/an-interview-with-jesy-from-little-mix/104446/|archive-date=6 March 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jade Thirlwall, the group "just wanted to write about a boy, but without making it typical.

According to Pinnock, "DNA" is "not just a love song, it's about being obsessed with someone to the extreme. And sometimes when things go bad you do go like that, you stalk them on [[Facebook]]&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="The Guardian Interview"/&gt; Nelson said the group play a character in the song and portray themselves to be darker than they are.&lt;ref name="Jesy"/&gt; Edwards said that when stripped of its scientific words, "DNA" is just a love song&lt;ref name="The Guardian Interview"/&gt; about "when a girl first gets with a boy, that kind of romance makes you feel really giddy and happy".&lt;ref name="Seventeen"/&gt;

"DNA" received generally positive reviews from music critics upon release. Lewis Corner of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' wrote, "Spooky synths, pumping heartbeats and a gothic choir finale make this pop perfection".&lt;ref name="10tracks"/&gt; In his review for the same website, Robert Copsey gave the track four stars out of five and said, "the epic, operatic middle eight is a pop moment this time they can claim entirely as their own".&lt;ref name="Robert Copsey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/single-reviews/review/a436074/little-mix-dna-single-review/|title=Little Mix: 'DNA' - Single review|last=Copsey|first=Robert|website=Digital Spy|date=6 November 2012|accessdate=17 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626102231/http://www.digitalspy.com/music/single-reviews/review/a436074/little-mix-dna-single-review/|archive-date=26 June 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[DIY (magazine)|DIY]]'' magazine's Laurence Green called it a "great pop tune by any mark" that "sounds quite a bit like a [[Girls Aloud]] song"  and "a sign of just how embedded Girls Aloud have become in the fabric of contemporary British pop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://diymag.com/archive/untouchable-why-the-return-of-girls-aloud-is-so-exciting|title=Untouchable: Why The Return Of Girls Aloud Is So Exciting|last=Green|first=Laurence|website=[[DIY (magazine)|DIY]]|date=9 October 2012|accessdate=17 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704123939/http://diymag.com/archive/untouchable-why-the-return-of-girls-aloud-is-so-exciting|archive-date=4 July 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Davison of ''No Ripcord'' rated the track eight out of ten, calling it "giddy, glitzy pop which would do Girls Aloud, or at least [[The Saturdays]], proud", adding; "You'll know exactly what 'DNA' sounds like before you hear it, and that's no bad thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.noripcord.com/features/singles-bar-12th-november-2012|title=The Singles Bar: 12th November 2012|last=Davison|first=Mark|website=No Ripcord|date=13 November 2012|accessdate=22 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306174912/https://www.noripcord.com/features/singles-bar-12th-november-2012|archive-date=6 March 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of the album ''DNA'', [[AllMusic]]'s Matt Collar cited the song among the "truly catchy, infectious cuts",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dna-mw0002285818|title=DNA - Little Mix|website=[[AllMusic]]|last=Collar|first=Matt|date=14 December 2012|accessdate=24 May 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Gqm3d1tp?url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/dna-mw0002285818|archivedate=24 May 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Malcolm Jack of ''[[The Guardian]]'' named it the album's best track, saying it "finally tests cautiously U-certificate boundaries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/03/little-mix-review|title=Little Mix – review|last=Jack|first=Malcolm|website=The Guardian|date=3 February 2013|accessdate=19 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208062222/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/03/little-mix-review|archive-date=8 February 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reviewer from ''The Guardian'' described the song as a "sprightly synth banger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=G2: Film &amp; Music: The F&amp;M Playlist|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=26 October 2012|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
