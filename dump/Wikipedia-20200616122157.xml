'''Flavius Romulus Augustus''' ([[Circa|c.]] AD 460 – after 476, possibly still alive as late as 507),&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Thomas, ''A History of the Ostrogoths,'' p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; known derisively and historiographically as '''Romulus Augustulus''', was the [[Roman emperor]] who ruled the [[Western Roman Empire]] from 31 October 475 until 4 September 476. He is often described as the "last Western Roman emperor", though some historians consider this to be [[Julius Nepos]]. [[Odoacer's deposition of Romulus Augustulus|His deposition]] by [[Odoacer]] traditionally marks the end of the [[Roman Empire]] in the West, [[Decline of the Roman Empire|the end of Ancient Rome]], and the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]] in Western Europe.

Although he, as all other emperors, adopted the name [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] upon his accession, he is better remembered by his derisive nickname ''Augustulus''.&lt;ref&gt;Older literature (appr. up to 1850) also refers to him as ''Romulus Momyllus'', ''Momyllus Augustulus'', etc., ''Momyllus'' being a corruption of ''Romulus''. Cf. Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall'', 4.36.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latin]] suffix ''-ulus'' is a [[diminutive]]; hence ''Augustulus'' effectively means "Little Augustus".&lt;ref name="romanemperors"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.roman-emperors.org/auggiero.htm | title = De Imperatoribus Romanis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Romulus'' was also changed derisively to ''Momyllus'' meaning "little disgrace".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/nfcc/0449.html|title=805-806 (Nordisk familjebok/Uggleupplagan. 23. Retzius - Ryssland)|date=1916|website=runeberg.org|language=sv|access-date=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical record contains few details of Romulus's life. He was the son of [[Orestes (father of Romulus Augustulus)|Orestes]], a Roman who once served as a secretary in the court of [[Attila|Attila the Hun]] before coming into the service of [[Julius Nepos]] in AD 475. In the same year he was promoted to the rank of ''[[magister militum]]'', but then led a military revolt that forced Nepos to flee into exile. With the capital of [[Ravenna]] under his control, Orestes appointed his son Romulus to the throne despite the lack of support from the [[Byzantine Empire|eastern court]] in [[Constantinople]]. Romulus, however, was little more than a child and [[figurehead (metaphor)|figurehead]] for his father's rule. After ten months in power, during which time his authority and legitimacy were disputed beyond Italy, Romulus was forced to abdicate by [[Odoacer]], a Germanic [[Foederati|foederatus]] officer who defeated and executed Orestes. After seizing control of Ravenna, Odoacer sent the former emperor to live in the [[Castellum Lucullanum]] in [[Campania]], after which he disappears from the historical record.

==Life==

[[File:628px-Western and Eastern Roman Empires 476AD(3).PNG|thumb|350px|The Western and the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] in 476.]]

[[File:Young Folks' History of Rome illus420.png|thumb|250px|Romulus Augustus resigns the crown. Drawing from the ''Young Folks' History of Rome'', 1880.]]

Romulus's father [[Orestes (father of Romulus Augustulus)|Orestes]] was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] citizen, originally from [[Pannonia]], who had served as a secretary and diplomat for [[Attila the Hun]] and later rose through the ranks of the [[Late Roman army|Roman army]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward, ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', David Womersley, ed. London; Penguin Books, 1994.  Vol. 3, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; The future emperor was named ''Romulus'' after his maternal grandfather, a nobleman from [[Poetovio]] in [[Noricum]]. Many historians have noted the coincidence that the last western emperor bore the names of both [[Romulus]], the legendary founder and first king of [[Rome]], and [[Augustus]], the first emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt; Though this is not as coincidental as it may seem; all emperors bore the name ''[[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]'' as it was part of the imperial title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Jesus to Christianity: How Four Generations of Visionaries &amp; Storytellers Created the New Testament and Christian Faith|last=White|first=L. Michael|date=2005|publisher=HarperCollins|year=|isbn=9780060816100|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orestes was appointed [[Magister militum]] by [[Julius Nepos]] in 475. Shortly after his appointment, Orestes launched a rebellion and captured [[Ravenna]], the capital of the Western Roman Empire since 402, on 28 August 475. Nepos fled to [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], where his uncle had ruled a semi-autonomous state in the 460s.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, pp. 391, 400.&lt;/ref&gt; Orestes, however, refused to become emperor, "from some secret motive", said historian [[Edward Gibbon]].&lt;ref name="gibbon402"&gt;Gibbon, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he installed his son on the throne on 31 October 475.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

The empire Augustus ruled was a shadow of its former self and had shrunk significantly over the previous 80 years. Imperial authority had retreated to the Italian borders and parts of southern [[Gaul]]: [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italia]] and [[Gallia Narbonensis]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, C. Warren, ''Medieval Europe: A Short History.''  New York; McGraw-Hill, 1995, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] treated its western counterpart as a [[client state]]. The Eastern Emperor [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo]], who died in 474, had appointed the western emperors [[Anthemius]] and [[Julius Nepos]], and [[Constantinople]] never recognized the new government. Neither [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] nor [[Basiliscus]], the two generals fighting for the eastern throne at the time of Romulus's accession, accepted him as ruler.&lt;ref name="romanemperors"/&gt;

As a proxy for his father, Romulus made no decisions and left no monuments, although coins bearing his name were minted in Rome, [[Milan]], [[Ravenna]], and [[Gaul]].&lt;ref name="romanemperors"/&gt; Several months after Orestes took power, a coalition of [[Heruli]], [[Scirian]], and [[Turcilingi]] [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] demanded that he give them a third of the land in Italy.&lt;ref name= "gibbon402"/&gt; When Orestes refused, the tribes revolted under the leadership of the Scirian chieftain [[Odoacer]]. Orestes was captured near [[Piacenza]] on 28 August 476 and swiftly [[Execution (legal)|executed]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Odoacer advanced on Ravenna, capturing the city and the young emperor after the short and decisive [[Battle of Ravenna (476)|Battle of Ravenna]]. Romulus was compelled to abdicate the throne on 4 September 476. This act has been cited as the end of the Western Roman Empire, although [[Deposition of Romulus Augustulus|Romulus's deposition]] did not cause any significant disruption at the time. Rome had already lost its hegemony over the provinces, Germanic peoples dominated the Roman army, and Germanic generals like Odoacer had long been the real [[power behind the throne|powers behind the throne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.romeacrosseurope.com/?p=3330#sthash.LfgBNaSY.dpbs|title=Romulus Augustus – The Last Roman Emperor|website=Rome Across Europe|language=en-US|access-date=19 April 2016|author=Norris, Shawn T.|date=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italy]] would suffer far greater devastation in the next century when Emperor [[Justinian I]] reconquered it in the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Collapse|last=Middleton|first=Guy D.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=9781107151499|location=|pages=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the abdication of Romulus, the [[Roman Senate]], on behalf of Odoacer, sent representatives to the Eastern Roman Emperor Zeno, whom it asked to formally reunite the two halves of the Empire, with Odoacer as the "protector of the state": "The West, they declared, no longer required an Emperor of its own: one monarch sufficed for the world..."&lt;ref&gt;Bryce 1961, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; Zeno was asked to make Odoacer a patrician, and administrator of Italy in Zeno's name. Zeno pointed out that the Senate should rightfully have first requested that Julius Nepos take the throne once more, but he nonetheless agreed to their requests as a ''[[fait accompli]]''. Odoacer, already the ''[[de facto]]'' ruler of Italy, now ostensibly ruled ''[[de jure]]'' in Zeno's name.&lt;ref name = "Bryce"&gt;{{citation | last = Bryce | first = James | title = The Holy Roman Empire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

The ultimate fate of Romulus is a mystery. The ''[[Anonymus Valesianus]]'' wrote that Odoacer, "taking pity on his youth" (he was about 16), spared Romulus's life and granted him an annual pension of 6,000 [[Solidus (coin)|solidi]] before sending him to live with relatives in [[Campania]].&lt;ref name="romanemperors"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gibbon406"&gt;Gibbon, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jordanes]] and [[Marcellinus Comes]] say Odoacer exiled Romulus to Campania but do not mention any financial support from the Germanic king.&lt;ref name="romanemperors"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gibbon406"/&gt;

The sources do agree that Romulus took up residence in the [[Castel dell'Ovo]] (Lucullan Villa) in [[Naples]], now a castle but originally built as a grand sea-side house by [[Lucullus]] in the 1st century BC,&lt;ref name="gibbon406"/&gt; fortified by [[Valentinian III]] in the mid-5th century.  From here, contemporary histories fall silent. In the ''[[History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', [[Edward Gibbon]] notes that the disciples of [[Severinus of Noricum|Saint Severinus of Noricum]] were invited by a "Neapolitan lady" to bring his body to the villa in 488;  Gibbon conjectures from this that Augustulus "was probably no more."&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; The villa was converted into a monastery before 500 to hold the saint's remains.&lt;ref name="gibbon406"/&gt;

[[Cassiodorus]], then a secretary to [[Theodoric the Great]], wrote a letter in 507 to a "Romulus" confirming a pension.&lt;ref name="romanemperors"/&gt; [[Thomas Hodgkin (historian)|Thomas Hodgkin]], a translator of Cassiodorus' works, wrote in 1886 that it was "surely possible" the Romulus in the letter was the same person as the last western emperor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=237769&amp;pageno=166 Cassiodorus, Variae, iii, 35.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The letter would match the description of Odoacer's coup in the ''Anonymus Valesianus'', and Romulus could have been alive in the early sixth century. But Cassiodorus does not supply any details about his correspondent or the size and nature of his pension, and Jordanes, whose history of the period abridges an earlier work by Cassiodorus, makes no mention of a pension.

===Last Western emperor===

[[File:Tremissis Julius Nepos-RIC 3221.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Julius Nepos]] on a gold [[tremissis]]]]

Some sources suggest that [[Julius Nepos]] claimed to hold the title of emperor legally when Odoacer took power. However, few of Nepos' contemporaries were willing to support his cause after he had fled to [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]. Some historians regard Julius Nepos, who ruled in Dalmatia until he was murdered in 480, as the last lawful Western Roman Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Eleanor Shipley | last = Duckett | title = The Gateway to the Middle Ages | chapter = I | page = [https://archive.org/details/gatewaytomiddlea00duck/page/1 1] | ISBN = 978-0-472-06051-1 | url = https://archive.org/details/gatewaytomiddlea00duck/page/1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Odoacer's coup, the [[Roman Senate]] sent a letter to [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] that stated that "the majesty of a sole monarch is sufficient to pervade and protect, at the same time, both the East and the West".&lt;ref name = "gibbon404"&gt;Gibbon, p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt; While Zeno told the Senate that Nepos was their lawful sovereign, he did not press the point and accepted the imperial insignia brought to him by the Senate.&lt;ref name = "Bryce" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gibbon404" /&gt;

== Legacy ==

As the last Western Roman emperor before the traditionally agreed-upon end of the Western Roman Empire, Romulus has been portrayed several times in film and literature; the play ''[[Romulus the Great]]'' (1950), by [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], focuses on the reign of "Romulus Augustus" and the end of the Roman Empire in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://thetheatretimes.com/make-rome-great-revival-duerrenmatts-romulus-great-new-york/ |title=Make Rome Great Again.
