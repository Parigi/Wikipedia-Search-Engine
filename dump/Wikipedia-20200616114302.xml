'''Windows 10''' is&lt;!--Attention! Do NOT change to "was". This violates [[MOS:TENSE]], which specifies that all articles on operating systems are written in previous tense, even if discontinued. Try editing any words as soon as possible.--&gt; a series of [[operating system]]s produced by the [[America]]n [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[technology]] company [[Microsoft]] and released as part of its [[Windows NT]] family of operating systems. It is the successor to [[Windows 8.1]] (2013), released nearly two years earlier, and was [[Software release cycle#Release to manufacturing (RTM)|released to manufacturing]] on July 15, 2015, and broadly released for the general public on July 29, 2015.&lt;ref name=release-date&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/06/01/hello-world-windows-10-available-on-july-29/|title=Hello World: Windows 10 Available on July 29|work=windows.com|accessdate=June 1, 2015|date=June 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows 10 was made available for download via [[MSDN]] and [[Microsoft Technet|Technet]] and available as a free upgrade for retail copies of [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows RT]] users via the [[Windows Store]]. Windows 10 receives new [[software build|builds]] on an ongoing basis, which are available at no additional cost to users, in addition to additional test builds of Windows 10 which are available to [[Windows Insider]]s. Devices in enterprise environments can receive these updates at a slower pace, or use long-term support milestones that only receive critical updates, such as security [[Patch (computing)|patches]], over their ten-year lifespan of extended support.&lt;ref name="zdnet-onebillion"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-big-windows-10-goal-one-billion-or-bust/|title=Microsoft's big Windows 10 goal: one billion or bust|last1=Bott|first1=Ed|authorlink=Ed Bott|date=|website=[[ZDNet]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.techproresearch.com/article/is-the-windows-10-long-term-servicing-branch-right-for-you/|title=Is the Windows 10 Long-Term Servicing Branch right for you?|last=Bott|first=Ed|date=July 22, 2016|work=TechProResearch|access-date=September 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Windows 10's most notable features is its support for [[universal app]]s, an expansion of the [[Metro-style app]]s first introduced in [[Windows 8]]. Universal apps can be designed to run across multiple Microsoft product families with nearly identical code{{nsmdns}}including [[Personal computer|PCs]], [[tablet computer|tablets]], [[smartphone]]s, [[embedded system]]s, [[Xbox One]], [[Surface Hub]] and [[Windows Mixed Reality|Mixed Reality]]. The Windows user interface was revised to handle transitions between a mouse-oriented interface and a [[touchscreen]]-optimized interface based on available input devices{{nsmdns}}particularly on [[2-in-1 PC]]s, both interfaces include an updated [[Start menu]] which incorporates elements of [[Windows 7]]'s traditional Start menu with the tiles of [[Windows 8]]. Windows 10 also introduced the [[Microsoft Edge]] [[web browser]], a [[virtual desktop]] system, a window and desktop management feature called [[Task View]], support for [[Fingerprint recognition|fingerprint]] and [[face recognition]] login, new security features for enterprise environments, and [[DirectX 12]].

Windows 10 received mostly positive reviews upon its original release in July 2015. Critics praised Microsoft's decision to provide a desktop-oriented interface in line with previous versions of Windows, contrasting the tablet-oriented approach of 8, although Windows 10's touch-oriented user interface mode was criticized for containing regressions upon the touch-oriented interface of Windows 8. Critics also praised the improvements to Windows 10's bundled software over Windows 8.1, [[Xbox Live]] integration, as well as the functionality and capabilities of the [[Cortana]] personal assistant and the replacement of [[Internet Explorer]] with Edge. However, media outlets have been critical of changes to operating system behaviors, including mandatory [[Windows Update|update]] installation, [[digital privacy|privacy]] concerns over data collection performed by the OS for Microsoft and its partners and the [[adware]]-like tactics used to promote the operating system on its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3073457/how-microsofts-nasty-new-windows-10-pop-up-tricks-you-into-upgrading.html|title=How Microsoft's tricky new Windows 10 pop-up deceives you into upgrading|last=Chacos|first=Brad|date=May 22, 2016|work=[[PC World]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=May 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft aimed to have Windows 10 installed on over a billion devices within three years of its release;&lt;ref name=zdnet-onebillion/&gt; this goal was ultimately reached in March 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21116762/microsoft-windows-10-active-devices-billion-7-support |title = Microsoft hits its goal of 1 billion devices running Windows 10|date = March 16, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2020|04|alt=By April 2020}}, an estimated 70.98%&lt;ref name ="share"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-201701-202001|title=Desktop Windows Version Market Share Worldwide|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; of traditional PCs running Windows are running Windows 10 (and almost all of the rest of Windows users run unsupported versions), and thus 55% &lt;!--54.72558% calculated from 70.98% x 77.1% "Total percentage of Windows" for desktop OS's multiplied by percentage of Windows 10 for Windows desktop OS.--&gt; of all traditional PCs use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-201701-202003|title=Desktop Operating System Market Share Worldwide|last=|first=|date=|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="share"/&gt; Across all platforms (PC, mobile, tablet and console), 35% &lt;!--34.96%--&gt; of devices run some kind of Windows, Windows 10 or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share#monthly-201807-202003|title=Operating System Market Share Worldwide|website=StatCounter Global Stats|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Microsoft Inspire|Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference]] in 2011, Andrew Lees, the chief of Microsoft's mobile technologies, said that the company intended to have a single [[software ecosystem]] for PCs, phones, tablets, and other devices. "We won't have an ecosystem for PCs, and one for phones, and one for tablets{{nsmdns}}they'll all come together."&lt;ref name="UniversalOS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.chron.com/techblog/2011/07/microsoft-envisions-a-universal-os-but-it-might-not-be-called-windows/|title=Microsoft envisions a universal OS, but it might not be called Windows|last=Silverman|first=Dwight|date=July 15, 2011|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SingleEcosystem"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2011/07/14/microsoft-one-ecosystem-pcs-tablets-phones-tvs-windows-brand-over |title=Microsoft says it will have a 'single ecosystem' for PCs, tablets, phones, and TVs... and is 'Windows' dead? |last=Patel |first=Nilay |date=July 14, 2011 |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |work=[[The Verge]] |accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, technology writer [[Mary Jo Foley]] reported that Microsoft was working on an update to Windows 8 codenamed "Threshold", after a planet in Microsoft's ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' video game franchise.&lt;ref name=zdnet-threshold /&gt; Similarly to "Blue" (which became Windows 8.1),&lt;ref name="pcw-whatisblue"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2027618/is-windows-blue-a-set-of-coordinated-updates-for-all-microsoft-products-.html | title=Is 'Windows Blue' a set of coordinated updates for all Microsoft products? | publisher=[[IDG]] | work=[[PC World]] | date=February 8, 2013 | last=Chacos | first=Brad | accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foley called Threshold a "wave of operating systems" across multiple Microsoft platforms and services, scheduled for the second quarter of 2015. Foley reported that among the goals for Threshold was to create a unified application platform and development toolkit for Windows, [[Windows Phone]] and Xbox One (which all use a similar [[Windows NT kernel]]).&lt;ref name="zdnet-threshold"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-codename-threshold-the-next-major-windows-wave-takes-shape/|title=Microsoft codename 'Threshold': The next major Windows wave takes shape|last=Foley|first=Mary Jo|authorlink=Mary Jo Foley|date=December 2, 2013|website=[[ZDNet]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=April 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-9leaks1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/21/5924013/windows-9-screenshots-start-menu | title=Leaked 'Windows 9' screenshots offer a closer look at the new Start Menu | publisher=[[Vox Media]] | date=July 21, 2014 | accessdate=September 30, 2014 | website=[[The Verge]] | first=Tom | last=Warren}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, at the [[Build (developer conference)|Build Conference]], Microsoft's [[Terry Myerson]] unveiled an updated version of Windows 8.1 (build 9697) that added the ability to run [[Windows Store app]]s inside desktop windows and [[Start menu#Second version|a more traditional Start menu]] in place of the [[Start menu#Third version|Start screen]] seen in Windows 8. The new Start menu takes after [[Windows 7]]'s design by using only a portion of the screen and including a Windows 7-style application listing in the first column. The second column displays Windows 8-style app tiles. Myerson said that these changes would occur in a future update, but did not elaborate.&lt;ref name="pcw-startback"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2138443/rejoice-the-start-menu-is-coming-back-to-windows.html|title=Rejoice!

=== Announcement ===
Threshold was officially unveiled during a media event on September 30, 2014, under the name Windows 10; Myerson said that Windows 10 would be Microsoft's "most comprehensive platform ever", providing a single, unified platform for [[desktop computer]]s, [[laptop]]s, [[Tablet computer|tablets]], smartphones, and [[all-in-One PC|all-in-one]] devices.&lt;ref name="slate-name"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/09/30/microsoft_windows_10_operating_system_windows_8_was_so_bad_it_s_skipping.html | title=Windows 8 Was So Bad That Microsoft Is Skipping Windows 9 | publisher=The Slate Group | work=Slate | date=September 30, 2014 | last=Oremus | first=Will}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seatimes-windows10"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.seattletimes.com/brierdudley/2014/09/29/microsoft-previews-windows-9/ | title=Microsoft reveals Windows 10 | publisher=Seattle Times Network | work=Seattle Times | last=Dudley | first=Brier | accessdate=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ext-why10"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/191279-why-is-it-called-windows-10-not-windows-9 | title=Why is it called Windows 10 not Windows 9? | publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] | date=February 2, 2015 | work=[[ExtremeTech]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized that Windows 10 would take steps towards restoring user interface mechanics from [[Windows 7]] to improve the experience for users on non-touch devices, noting criticism of Windows 8's touch-oriented interface by keyboard and mouse users.&lt;ref name="verge-win10"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/30/6868695/microsoft-windows-10-announced-official | title=Windows 10 is the official name for Microsoft's next version of Windows | publisher=[[Vox Media]] | date=September 30, 2014 | website=[[The Verge]] | first=Tom | last=Warren}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-continuum /&gt; Despite these concessions, Myerson noted that the touch-oriented interface would evolve as well on 10.&lt;ref name="ext-liveblog"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.extremetech.com/computing/191135-windows-9-event-san-francisco-live-blog|title=Microsoft's Windows 10 event in San Francisco: Updated live blog|last=Anthony|first=Sebastian|date=September 30, 2014|website=ExtremeTech|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to Microsoft naming the new operating system Windows 10 instead of Windows 9, Terry Myerson said that "based on the product that's coming, and just how different our approach will be overall, it wouldn't be right to call it Windows 9."&lt;ref name="Guardian-name"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/30/microsoft-windows-10-release | title=Microsoft unveils Windows 10: 'It wouldn't be right to call it Windows 9' | work=[[theguardian.com]] | publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] | date=September 30, 2014 | first=Dominic | last=Rushe}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also joked that they could not call it "Windows One" (alluding to several recent Microsoft products with a similar brand, such as [[OneDrive]], [[OneNote]], and Xbox One) because [[Windows 1.0]] already existed.&lt;ref name="reuters-name"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/microsoft-windows-idUSL2N0RV1RF20140930 | title=Microsoft names next operating system 'Windows 10' | work=[[Reuters]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] | date=September 30, 2014 | first=Bill | last=Rigby}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Prophet, Microsoft Vice President of Windows Marketing, said at a San Francisco conference in October 2014 that Windows 9 "came and went", and that Windows 10 is not "an incremental step from Windows 8.1," but "a material step. We're trying to create one platform, one eco-system that unites as many of the devices{{sic}} from the small embedded Internet of Things, through tablets, through phones, through PCs and, ultimately, into the Xbox."&lt;ref name="BuinessInsider-name"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/this-is-what-happened-to-windows-9-2014-10|title=Microsoft's New Windows Marketing Boss Explains What Happened to Windows 9|last=Bort|first=Julie|date=October 13, 2014|work=[[Business Insider]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=May 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further details surrounding Windows 10's consumer-oriented features were presented during another media event held on January 21, 2015, entitled "Windows 10: The Next Chapter". The keynote featured the unveiling of Cortana integration within the operating system, new [[Xbox]]-oriented features, Windows 10 Mobile, an updated [[Office Mobile]] suite, [[Surface Hub]]{{nsmdns}}a large-screened Windows 10 device for enterprise collaboration based upon [[Perceptive Pixel]] technology,&lt;ref name=verge-surfacehub&gt;{{cite web |title=Microsoft announces 84-inch Surface Hub tailored for Windows 10 |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/21/7867585/microsoft-surface-hub-announced |website=The Verge |date=January 21, 2015 |publisher=Vox Media |accessdate=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[HoloLens]]‑[[augmented reality]] eyewear and an associated platform for building apps that can render [[holograms]] through HoloLens.&lt;ref name=pcmag-nextchapterevent&gt;{{cite web |title=Windows 10: Cortana, a New Browser ...and Holograms? |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2475515,00.asp |website=PC Magazine |publisher=Ziff Davis Media |accessdate=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional developer-oriented details surrounding the "[[Universal Windows Platform]]" concept were revealed and discussed during Microsoft's developers' conference ''[[Microsoft Build|Build]]''. Among them were the unveiling of "Islandwood", which provides a [[middleware]] [[toolchain]] for compiling [[Objective-C]] based software (particularly [[iOS]] software) to run as universal apps on Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile.

=== User interface and desktop ===
[[File:Virtual Desktops in Windows 10.png|thumb|left|The "[[Task View]]" display is a new feature to Windows 10, allowing the use of multiple workspaces.]]
A new iteration of the [[Start menu]] is used on the Windows 10 desktop, with a list of places and other options on the left side, and tiles representing applications on the right. The menu can be resized, and expanded into a full-screen display, which is the default option in Tablet mode.&lt;ref name="verge-win10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tomsguide-unveiled" /&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-closerlook /&gt; A new virtual desktop system was added. A feature known as Task View displays all open windows and allows users to switch between them, or switch between multiple workspaces.&lt;ref name="verge-win10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tomsguide-unveiled"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tomsguide.com/us/windows-10-unveiled,news-19648.html|title=Microsoft Unveils Windows 10 with New Start Menu|last=Andronico|first=Michael|date=September 30, 2014|website=Tom's Guide|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universal apps, which previously could be used only in full screen mode, can now be used in self-contained windows similarly to other programs.&lt;ref name="verge-win10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tomsguide-unveiled" /&gt; Program windows can now be snapped to quadrants of the screen by dragging them to the corner. When a window is snapped to one side of the screen, Task View appears and the user is prompted to choose a second window to fill the unused side of the screen (called "Snap Assist").&lt;ref name="tomsguide-unveiled" /&gt; Windows' system icons were also changed.&lt;ref name=verge-closerlook /&gt;

[[Windows shell#Charms|Charms]] have been removed; their functionality in universal apps is accessed from an ''App commands'' menu on their title bar.&lt;ref name="verge-win10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tomsguide-unveiled" /&gt; In its place is Action Center, which displays notifications and settings toggles. It is accessed by clicking an icon in the notification area, or dragging from the right of the screen.

Windows 10 is designed to adapt its user interface based on the type of device being used and available input methods. It offers two separate user interface modes: a user interface optimized for mouse and keyboard, and a "Tablet mode" designed for touchscreens. Users can toggle between these two modes at any time, and Windows can prompt or automatically switch when certain events occur, such as disabling Tablet mode on a tablet if a keyboard or mouse is plugged in, or when a [[2-in-1 PC]] is switched to its laptop state. In Tablet mode, programs default to a maximized view, and the taskbar contains a back button and hides buttons for opened or pinned programs; Task View is used instead to switch between programs. The full screen Start menu is used in this mode, similarly to Windows 8, but scrolls vertically instead of horizontally.&lt;ref name="verge-continuum"&gt;{{cite web |title=Watch how Windows 10 works with touch interfaces |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/30/6873963/windows-10-continuum-touch-interface |website=[[The Verge]] |date=September 30, 2014 |accessdate=September 30, 2014 |publisher=[[Vox Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thurrotcom-tablet1&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 10 Technical Preview 2: Configure Tablet Mode|url=https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/3116/windows-10-technical-preview-2-configure-tablet-mode|website=Thurrott.com|date=April 23, 2015|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thurrotcom-tablet2&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 10 Technical Preview 2: Continuum and Tablet Mode|url=https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/2240/windows-10-technical-preview-2-continuum-and-tablet-mode|website=Thurrott.com|date=March 20, 2015|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=winbeta-w10touch&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowden|first1=Zack|title=Windows 10: The tablet experience is better than ever (with video)|url=http://www.winbeta.org/news/windows-10-tablet-experience-better-ever|website=WinBeta|date=July 3, 2015|accessdate=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== System security ===
[[File:Windows Hello in Enpass.png|thumb|Windows Hello unlock prompt on a [[Surface Pro 4]] while using [[Enpass]] (a [[password manager]])]]
Windows 10 incorporates [[multi-factor authentication]] technology based upon standards developed by the [[FIDO Alliance]].&lt;ref name="zdnet-nextgencredentials"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-reveals-audacious-plans-to-tighten-security-with-windows-10/|title=Microsoft reveals audacious plans to tighten security with Windows 10|last1=Bott|first1=Ed|authorlink=Ed Bott|date=October 22, 2014|website=ZDNet|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=April 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operating system includes improved support for [[biometric authentication]] through the Windows Hello platform. Devices with supported cameras (requiring [[infrared]] illumination, such as [[Intel RealSense]]) allow users to log in with iris or [[face recognition]], similarly to [[Kinect]]. Devices with supported readers allow users to log in through [[fingerprint recognition]]. Support was also added for palm-vein scanning through a partnership with [[Fujitsu]] in February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/no-more-windows-10-passwords-microsoft-says-hello-to-palm-vein-biometrics/|title=No more Windows 10 passwords? Microsoft says Hello to palm-vein biometrics|last=Tung|first=Liam|date=February 9, 2018|work=[[ZDNet]]|access-date=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Credentials are stored locally and protected using [[asymmetric encryption]].&lt;ref name=ars-hello&gt;{{cite web |title=Windows 10 says "Hello" to logging in with your face and the end of passwords |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/03/windows-10-says-hello-to-logging-in-with-your-face-and-the-end-of-passwords/ |website=Ars Technica |date=March 17, 2015 |accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to biometric authentication, Windows Hello supports authentication with a [[Personal identification number|PIN]]. By default, Windows requires a PIN to consist of four digits, but can be configured to permit more complex PINs. However, a PIN is not a simpler [[password]]. While passwords are transmitted to [[domain controller]]s, PINs are not. They are tied to one device, and if compromised, only one device is affected. Backed by a [[Trusted Platform Module]] (TPM) chip, Windows uses PINs to create strong asymmetric key pairs. As such, the authentication token transmitted to the server is harder to crack. In addition, whereas weak passwords may be broken via [[rainbow table]]s, TPM causes the much-simpler Windows PINs to be resilient to [[brute-force attack]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Halfin |first1=Dani |last2=Syfuhs |first2=Steve |title=Why a PIN is better than a password |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-why-pin-is-better-than-password |website=Microsoft Docs |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=October 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Windows 10 was first introduced, multi-factor authentication was provided by two components: Windows Hello and Passport (not to be confused with [[Microsoft account|the Passport platform of 1998]]). Later, Passport was merged into Windows Hello.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Halfin|first1=Dani|last2=Lich|first2=Brian|last3=McIlhargey|first3=Bill|title=Windows Hello for Business Overview|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/access-protection/hello-for-business/hello-overview|website=[[Microsoft Docs]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=October 30, 2017|date=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-hello /&gt;

The enterprise version of Windows 10 offers additional security features; administrators can set up policies for the automatic [[Data encryption|encryption]] of sensitive data, selectively block applications from accessing encrypted data, and enable ''Device Guard''{{nsmdns}}a system which allows administrators to enforce a high-security environment by blocking the execution of software that is not digitally signed by a trusted vendor or Microsoft. Device Guard is designed to protect against [[zero-day exploit]]s, and runs inside a [[hypervisor]] so that its operation remains separated from the operating system itself.&lt;ref name=zdnet-nextgencredentials /&gt;&lt;ref name="techradar-deviceguard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/software/security-software/device-guard-safeguards-windows-10-with-hardware-authentication-1291767|title=Device Guard safeguards Windows 10 with hardware authentication|last=Nguyen|first=Chuong|date=April 22, 2015|website=[[TechRadar]]|publisher=Future|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=April 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Command line ===
[[Windows Console]] windows (for both [[PowerShell]] and the legacy [[cmd.exe|Command Prompt]]) can now be resized without any restrictions, can be made to cover the full screen by pressing {{Keypress|Alt|Enter}}, and can use standard keyboard shortcuts, such as those for [[cut, copy, and paste]]. Other features such as word wrap and transparency were also added. These functions can be disabled to revert to the legacy console if needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2014/10/07/console-improvements-in-the-windows-10-technical-preview/|title=Console Improvements in the Windows 10 Technical Preview|last=Denning|first=Adam|date=October 7, 2014|website=Windows Developer Blog|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=April 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Screenshot of ‘Bash on Ubuntu on Windows’.png|thumb|[[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]] running on Windows 10]]
The Anniversary Update adds [[Windows Subsystem for Linux]], which allows the installation of a [[user space]] environment from a supported [[Linux]] [[Linux distribution|distribution]] that runs natively on Windows. The subsystem translates Linux [[system call]]s that the Linux system uses to those of the Windows NT kernel. The environment can execute the [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]] shell and 64-bit command line programs. Windows applications cannot be executed from the Linux environment, and vice versa. Linux distributions for Windows Subsystem for Linux are obtained through Microsoft Store. The feature initially supported an [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]-based environment; Microsoft announced in May 2017 that it would add [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] and [[OpenSUSE]] environment options as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gartenberg|first1=Chaim|title=Linux distros won't run on Windows 10 S after all|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/5/19/15666356/linux-distros-command-line-windows-10-s-store|website=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-to-show-bash-on-linux-running-on-windows-10/|title=Microsoft to show Bash on Linux running on Windows 10|last1=Foley|first1=Mary Jo|authorlink1=Mary Jo Foley|date=March 29, 2016|website=[[ZDNet]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-microsoft-will-support-bash-on-windows-10/|title=Here's how Microsoft will support Bash on Windows 10|last1=Foley|first1=Mary Jo|authorlink1=Mary Jo Foley|date=March 30, 2016|website=[[ZDNet]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/03/30/run-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows/|title=Run Bash on Ubuntu on Windows|last1=Harsh|first1=Mike|date=March 30, 2016|website=Windows Experience Blog|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=April 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hanselman|first1=Scott|title=Developers can run Bash Shell and user-mode Ubuntu Linux binaries on Windows 10|url=http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DevelopersCanRunBashShellAndUsermodeUbuntuLinuxBinariesOnWindows10.aspx|website=Scott Hanselman's Blog|date=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aiello|first1=Joey|title=Bash for Windows: Why it's awesome and what it means for PowerShell|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2016/04/01/bash-for-windows-why-its-awesome-and-what-it-means-for-powershell/|website=Windows PowerShell Blog|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-susefedorawin10"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/5/11/15625320/ubuntu-suse-linux-fedora-windows-store-microsoft-build-2017|title=Ubuntu, SUSE Linux, and Fedora are all coming to the Windows Store|last=Gartenberg|first=Chaim|date=May 11, 2017|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=April 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Storage requirements ===
To reduce the storage footprint of the operating system, Windows 10 automatically [[Data compression|compresses]] system files. The system can reduce the storage footprint of Windows by approximately 1.5{{nbsp}}GB for [[32-bit]] systems and 2.6{{nbsp}}GB for [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] systems. The level of compression used is dependent on a performance assessment performed during installations or by [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEMs]], which tests how much compression can be used without harming operating system performance. Furthermore, the Refresh and Reset functions use runtime system files instead, making a separate recovery partition redundant, allowing [[Patch (computing)|patches]] and updates to remain installed following the operation, and further reducing the amount of space required for Windows 10 by up to 12{{nbsp}}GB. These functions replace the [[Features new to Windows 8#Installation|WIMBoot mode]] introduced on Windows 8.1 Update, which allowed OEMs to configure low-capacity devices with flash-based storage to use Windows system files out of the compressed [[Windows Imaging Format|WIM image]] typically used for installation and recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/2062/microsoft-explains-os-compression-in-windows-10 |title=Microsoft Explains OS Compression in Windows 10 |last1=Thurrot |first1=Paul |date=March 16, 2015 |website=Thurrot.com |publisher=[[WP:SPS|self-published]] |access-date=March 17, 2015}}{{better source|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-promises-drastic-cuts-in-disk-space-use-for-windows-10/|title=Microsoft promises drastic cuts in disk space use for Windows 10|last1=Bott|first1=Ed|authorlink=Ed Bott|date=March 16, 2015|website=ZDnet|publisher=CBS Interactive|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="winblog-compression"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/03/16/how-windows-10-achieves-its-compact-footprint/|title=How Windows 10 achieves its compact footprint|last=|first=|date=March 16, 2015|website=Windows Experience Blog|publisher=Microsoft|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=April 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows 10 also includes a function in its Settings app that allows users to view a breakdown of how their device's storage capacity is being used by different types of files, and determine whether certain types of files are saved to internal storage or an [[SD card]] by default.&lt;ref name=techrepublic-storagesense&gt;{{cite web |title= Leaked Windows 10 Build 9901 shows smarter Storage Sense |url= http://www.techrepublic.com/article/leaked-windows-10-build-9901-shows-smarter-storage-sense/ |first=Tony |last=Bradley|website=TechRepublic |date=December 17, 2014|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Online services and functionality ===
Windows 10 introduces a new default [[web browser]], [[Microsoft Edge]]. It initially featured a new [[Web standards|standards]]-compliant rendering engine derived from [[Trident (layout engine)|Trident]], and also includes annotation tools and integration with other Microsoft platforms present within Windows 10.&lt;ref name=zdnet-underhood&gt;{{cite web |title=Microsoft's Spartan browser: What's under the hood |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-spartan-browser-whats-under-the-hood/ |first=Mary Jo |last=Foley|author-link=Mary Jo Foley|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |website=[[ZDNet]] |accessdate=January 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ieblog-spartan&gt;{{cite web |title=Project Spartan and the Windows 10 January Preview Build |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2015/01/22/project-spartan-and-the-windows-10-january-preview-build.aspx |website=IEBlog |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=January 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-msedge&gt;{{cite web|title=The successor to Internet Explorer will be named Microsoft Edge|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/29/8511169/microsoft-edge-official-name-internet-explorer-upgrade|first=Tom |last=Warren|website=The Verge|accessdate=April 29, 2015|date=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet Explorer 11 is maintained on Windows 10 for compatibility purposes, but is deprecated in favor of Edge and will no longer be actively developed.&lt;ref name=verge-relegatesie11&gt;{{cite web |title=Microsoft relegates Internet Explorer to a 'legacy engine' to make way for new browser |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/24/8284781/internet-explorer-is-slowly-dying |first=Tom |last=Warren|website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=March 24, 2015|accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ieblog-edge"&gt;{{cite web |title=Living on the Edge – our next step in helping the web just work |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2014/11/11/living-on-the-edge-our-next-step-in-interoperability.aspx |website=IEBlog |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=January 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2020, the initial version of Edge was succeeded by a new iteration that is derived from the [[Chromium project]] and [[Blink (layout engine)|Blink layout engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20942038/microsoft-edge-chromium-release-date-new-logo-features|title=Microsoft's Edge Chromium browser will launch on January 15th with a new logo|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=November 4, 2019|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=January 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Microsoft Family Safety]] is replaced by Microsoft Family, a [[parental controls]] system that applies across Windows platforms and Microsoft online services. Users can create a designated family, and monitor and restrict the actions of users designated as children, such as access to websites, enforcing age ratings on Microsoft Store purchases, and other restrictions. The service can also send weekly e-mail reports to parents detailing a child's computer usage. Unlike previous versions of Windows, child accounts in a family must be associated with a Microsoft account{{nsmdns}}which allows these settings to apply across all Windows 10 devices that a particular child is using.&lt;ref name=thurrott-family&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside Microsoft Family and Windows 10 Parental Controls|url=https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/5187/inside-microsoft-family-and-windows-10-parental-controls|website=Thurrott.com|date=August 11, 2015|accessdate=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bi-emailfamily&gt;{{cite web|title=People are freaking out over a feature in Windows 10's family accounts|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/there-are-privacy-concerns-over-windows-10s-family-activity-report-2015-8|first=Max |last=Slater-Robins|date=August 27, 2015|accessdate=September 12, 2015|work=[[Business Insider]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows 10 also offers the Wi-Fi Sense feature originating from Windows Phone 8.1; users can optionally have their device automatically connect to suggested open hotspots, and share their home network's password with contacts (either via [[Skype]], [[People (Microsoft service)|People]], or [[Facebook]]) so they may automatically connect to the network on a Windows 10 device without needing to manually enter its password. Credentials are stored in an encrypted form on Microsoft servers and sent to the devices of the selected contacts. Passwords are not viewable by the guest user, and the guest user is not allowed to access other computers or devices on the network. Wi-Fi Sense is not usable on [[802.1X]]-encrypted networks. Adding "_optout" at the end of the [[SSID]] will also block the corresponding network from being used for this feature.&lt;ref name="pcworld-wifisense"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2943752/wifi-passwordsharing-feature-in-windows-10-raises-security-concerns.html|title=Windows 10's Wi-Fi Sense password sharing sparks security concerns|last=Frank|first=Blair Hanley|date=July 2, 2015|website=[[PC World]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=April 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editions and pricing ==
{{Main|Windows 10 editions}}
Windows 10 is available in five main [[Windows 10 editions|editions]] for personal computing devices, of which the Home and Pro versions are sold at retail in most countries, and as pre-loaded software on new computers. Home is aimed at home users, while Pro is aimed at small businesses. Each edition of Windows{{nbsp}}10 includes all of the capabilities and features of the edition below it, and add additional features oriented towards their market segments; for example, Pro adds additional networking and security features such as [[BitLocker]], Device Guard, Windows Update for Business, and the ability to join a [[Windows domain|domain]]. The remaining editions, Enterprise and ''Education'', contain additional features aimed towards business environments, and are only available through [[volume licensing]].&lt;ref name=verge-w10editions /&gt;&lt;ref name=ms-w10editions /&gt;

As part of Microsoft's unification strategies, Windows products that are based on Windows 10's common platform but meant for specialized platforms are marketed as editions of the operating system, rather than as separate product lines. An updated version of Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system for smartphones, and also tablets, was branded as ''[[Windows 10 Mobile]]''.&lt;ref name=ars-firstlookwp10&gt;{{cite web|title=Our first look at Windows 10 on phones, and Universal Apps for touchscreens|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/01/our-first-look-at-windows-10-on-phones-and-universal-apps-for-touchscreens/|website=Ars Technica|date=January 21, 2015|publisher=Condé Nast|accessdate=January 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Editions of Enterprise and ''Mobile'' will also be produced for [[embedded systems]], along with ''[[Windows 10 IoT Core]]'', which is designed specifically for use in small footprint, low-cost devices and [[Internet of Things]] (IoT) scenarios and is similar to [[Windows Embedded]].&lt;ref name=verge-w10editions&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft reveals all the editions of Windows 10|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/13/8599841/windows-10-home-mobile-pro-editions|website=The Verge|date=May 13, 2015|accessdate=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ms-w10editions&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing Windows 10 Editions|date=May 13, 2015|url=http://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/05/13/introducing-windows-10-editions/|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 2017, Microsoft unveiled ''Windows 10 S'' (referred to in leaks as ''Windows 10 Cloud''), a feature-limited version of Windows 10 which was designed primarily for devices in the education market (competing, in particular, with [[Chrome OS]] netbooks), such as the [[Surface Laptop]] that Microsoft also unveiled at this time. The OS restricts software installation to applications obtained from Microsoft Store; the device may be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro for a fee to enable unrestricted software installation. As a time-limited promotion, Microsoft stated that this upgrade would be free on the Surface Laptop until March 31, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-starts-selling-a-surface-laptop-with-windows-10-pro-pre-installed|title=Microsoft starts selling a Surface Laptop with Windows 10 Pro pre-installed|work=TechRadar|access-date=February 3, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows 10 S also contains a faster initial setup and login process, and allows devices to be provisioned using a USB drive with the Windows Intune for Education platform.&lt;ref name="pcw-w10s"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet Windows 10 S, a streamlined, simplified, Windows Store-only OS for schools|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3193700/windows/meet-windows-10-s-a-streamlined-simplified-windows-store-only-os-for-schools.html|website=PC World|date=May 2, 2017|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-windows10s"&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 10 S is Microsoft's answer to Chrome OS|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/2/15506378/microsoft-windows-10-s-os-operating-system-announced-features|website=The Verge|date=May 2, 2017|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/09/desktop-apps-make-their-way-into-the-windows-store/|title=Desktop apps make their way into the Windows Store|last=Bright|first=Peter|date=September 14, 2016|website=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-10cloudscreen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 10 Cloud looks just like Windows 10 in leaked screenshots|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/3/14502748/windows-10-cloud-leaked-screenshots|website=The Verge|date=February 3, 2017|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pcw-w10cloud"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leaked Microsoft document confirms Windows 10 Cloud and a Chromebook competitor|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3191195/computers/leaked-microsoft-document-confirms-windows-10-cloud-and-a-chromebook-competitor.html|website=PC World|date=April 21, 2017|publisher=IDG|accessdate=April 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, Microsoft announced that Windows 10 S would be deprecated due to market confusion, and would be replaced by "S Mode", an OEM option wherein Windows defaults to only allowing applications to be installed from Microsoft Store, but does not require payment in order to disable these restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/8/17095424/microsoft-windows-10-s-mode-free-upgrades|title=Microsoft admits Windows 10 S was confusing, new 'S Mode' upgrades will be free|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=March 8, 2018|work=The Verge|access-date=April 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tung"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-to-permit-block-on-apps-installing-if-theyre-not-from-microsoft-store/|title=Windows 10 to permit block on apps installing if they're not from Microsoft Store|last=Tung|first=Liam|work=ZDNet|access-date=March 8, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public release ===
Microsoft promoted that Windows 10 would become [[Software release life cycle#General availability|generally available (GA)]] on July 29, 2015. In comparison to previous Windows releases, which had a longer turnover between the [[release to manufacturing]] (RTM) and general release to allow for testing by vendors (and in some cases, the development of "upgrade kits" to prepare systems for installation of the new version), an [[HP Inc.]] executive explained that because it knew Microsoft targeted the operating system for a release in 2015, the company was able to optimize its then-current and upcoming products for Windows 10 in advance of its release, negating the need for such a milestone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/3901/hp-exec-explains-why-windows-10-launch-is-different |title=HP Exec Explains Why Windows 10 Launch is Different |last1=Thurrott |first1=Paul |date=June 1, 2015 |website=Thurrott.com |publisher=[[WP:SPS|self-published]] |access-date=June 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2016}}

On the general availability build of Windows{{nbsp}}10 Version 1507, to activate and generate the "digital entitlement" for Windows{{nbsp}}10, the operating system must have first been installed as an in-place upgrade. During the free upgrade, a genuineticket.xml file is created in the background and the system's motherboard details are registered with a Microsoft Product Activation server. Once installed, the operating system can be reinstalled on that particular system via normal means without a product key, and the system's license will automatically be detected via online activation - in essence, the Microsoft Product Activation Server will remember the system's motherboard and give it the green light for product re-activation.&lt;ref name="penton-10activate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pcw-digitalentitlement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-cleaninstall"&gt;{{cite web|title=How to clean install Windows 10|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/31/9077997/microsoft-windows-10-clean-install-how-to-guide|website=The Verge|date=July 31, 2015|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to installation issues with Upgrade Only installs, in November 2015, Windows 10 Version 1511 was released with additional activation mechanisms. This build treated Windows{{nbsp}}7 and Windows{{nbsp}}8/8.1 product keys as Windows{{nbsp}}10 Product Keys, meaning they could be entered during installation to activate the free license, without the need to upgrade first to "activate" the hardware with Microsoft's activation servers.&lt;ref name="Windows 10 Blog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Announcing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 10565|url=http://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/10/12/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-10565/|website=Windows 10 blog|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For major Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), Windows 8/8.1 and Windows 10 OEM Product Keys are embedded in the firmware of the motherboard and if the correct edition of Windows 10 is present on the installation media, they are automatically inputted during installation. Since the release of Windows 10 version 1709, Microsoft decided to release multi-edition installation media, to alleviate installation and product activation issues users experienced due to accidentally installing the wrong Edition of Windows 10. Despite the 1-year free upgrade offer having long expired, all activation mechanisms involving Windows 7 and Windows 8 keys still work with all subsequent builds of Windows 10, even Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1 product keys that have never been used for a previous Windows 10 installation.

The Windows Insider Preview version of Windows{{nbsp}}10 automatically updated itself to the generally released version as part of the version progression and continues to be updated to new beta builds, as it had throughout the testing process. [[Microsoft]] explicitly stated that [[Windows Insider]] was not a valid upgrade path for those running a version of [[Windows]] that is ineligible for the upgrade offer; although, if it was not installed with a license carried over from an in-place upgrade to 10 ''Insider Preview'' from Windows{{nbsp}}7 or{{nbsp}}8, the Insider Preview does remain activated as long as the user does not exit the Windows Insider program.&lt;ref name="ars-msbacksaway" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-w10insiderfree"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft clarification kinda clears up free Windows 10 license confusion|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/06/microsoft-clarification-kinda-clears-up-free-windows-10-license-confusion/|website=Ars Technica|date=June 22, 2015|publisher=Conde Nast Digital|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offer was promoted and delivered via the "Get Windows{{nbsp}}10" application ("GWX"), which was automatically installed via [[Windows Update]] ahead of Windows 10's release, and activated on systems deemed eligible for the upgrade offer. Via a [[notification area]] icon, users could access an application that advertised Windows{{nbsp}}10 and the free upgrade offer, check device compatibility, and "reserve" an automatic download of the operating system upon its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keizer|first1=Gregg|title=Automatic update delivered to most Windows 7 and 8.1 consumer devices illustrates aggressive marketing intent|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2906810/microsoft-seeds-windows-7-81-pcs-with-windows-10-upgrade-nag-notices.html|website=ComputerWorld|date=April 8, 2015|publisher=IDC|accessdate=July 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nw-reserve10&gt;{{cite web|title=Reserve your free Windows 10 upgrade, download available on July 29|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2929473/microsoft-subnet/reserve-your-free-windows-10-upgrade-download-available-on-july-29.html|website=Network World|date=June 2015|accessdate=June 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 28, a pre-download process began in which Windows{{nbsp}}10 installation files were downloaded to some computers that had reserved it.

==== Licensing ====
During upgrades, Windows{{nbsp}}10 licenses are not tied directly to a product key. Instead, the license status of the system's current installation of Windows is migrated, and a "Digital license" (also known as "Digital entitlement" in version 1511 or earlier) is generated during the [[Windows Product Activation|activation]] process, which is bound to the hardware information collected during the process. If Windows{{nbsp}}10 is reinstalled cleanly and there have not been any significant hardware changes since installation (such as a motherboard change), the online activation process will automatically recognize the system's digital entitlement if no product key is entered during installations. However, unique product keys are still distributed within retail copies of Windows{{nbsp}}10. As with previous non-volume-licensed versions of Windows, significant hardware changes will invalidate the digital entitlement, and require Windows to be re-activated.&lt;ref name=penton-10activate&gt;{{cite web|title=How to make sure your free copy of Windows 10 is activated|url=http://winsupersite.com/windows-10/how-make-sure-your-free-copy-windows-10-activated|first=Richard|last=Hay|website=Supersite for Windows|publisher=Penton|date=Jul 30, 2015|accessdate=July 31, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801182728/http://winsupersite.com/windows-10/how-make-sure-your-free-copy-windows-10-activated|archive-date=August 1, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pcw-digitalentitlement&gt;{{cite web|title=Why you can't find your product key after upgrading to Windows 10|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2970075/windows/why-you-cant-find-your-product-key-after-upgrading-to-windows-10.html|first=Ian |last=Paul|website=[[PC World]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|date=August 12, 2015|accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Updates and support ==
{{Main|Windows 10 version history}}
{{Windows 10 versions}}
Unlike previous versions of Windows, Windows Update does not allow the selective installation of updates, and all updates (including patches, feature updates, and [[driver software]]) are downloaded and installed automatically. Users can only choose whether their system will reboot automatically to install updates when the system is inactive, or be notified to schedule a reboot.&lt;ref name=cnet-scheduleupdate&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 10 lets you schedule Windows Update restarts|url=http://www.cnet.com/how-to/windows-10-lets-you-schedule-windows-update-restarts/|website=CNET|accessdate=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crn-updates&gt;{{cite web|title=Did Microsoft Just Backtrack on Forced Updates For Windows 10?|url=http://www.crn.com/news/applications-os/300077576/did-microsoft-just-backtrack-on-forced-updates-for-windows-10.htm|website=CRN.com|date=July 27, 2015|accessdate=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a wireless network is designated as "Metered"—a function which automatically reduces the operating system's background network activity to conserve [[bandwidth cap|limits on Internet usage]], most updates are not downloaded until the device is connected to a non-metered network. Redstone 2 allows wired ([[Ethernet]]) networks to be designated as metered, but Windows may still download certain updates while connected to a metered network.&lt;ref name="pcw-w10meteredupdates"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3181991/windows-10s-creators-update-may-nerf-a-workaround-to-mandatory-updates.html|title=Windows 10's Creators Update tweaks a workaround for mandatory updates|last=Paul|first=Ian|date=March 17, 2017|website=PC World|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=April 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953132/windows/set-windows-10s-wi-fi-connections-as-metered-to-download-forced-updates-at-your-own-pace.html |title=Set Windows 10's Wi-Fi connections as metered to download forced updates at your own pace |website=[[PC World]] |publisher=[[IDG]] |date=July 28, 2016 |first=Ian |last=Paul |accessdate= April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Updates can cause compatibility or other problems; a Microsoft troubleshooter program allows bad updates to be uninstalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2975289/windows/how-to-cure-windows-10s-worst-headaches.html |title=How to cure Windows 10's worst headaches |website=[[PC World]] |publisher=[[IDG]] |date=August 26, 2015 |first=Ian |last=Paul |accessdate= April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930 |title=How to temporarily prevent a Windows or driver update from reinstalling in Windows 10 |work=Support |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=July 28, 2015 |accessdate=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows Update can also use a [[peer to peer]] system for distributing updates; by default, users' [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] is used to distribute previously downloaded updates to other users, in combination with Microsoft servers. Users can instead choose to only use peer-to-peer updates within their [[local area network]].&lt;ref name=pcw-peertopeer&gt;{{cite web|title=How to stop Windows 10 from using your PC's bandwidth to update strangers' systems|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2955491/windows/how-to-stop-windows-10-from-using-your-pcs-bandwidth-to-update-strangers-systems.html|website=[[PC World]]|date=August 3, 2015|publisher=[[IDG]]|accessdate=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original RTM release of Windows{{nbsp}}10 ("Windows{{nbsp}}10, released in July 2015") receives mainstream support for five years after its original release, followed by five years of extended support, but this is subject to conditions. Microsoft's support lifecycle policy for the operating system notes that "Updates are cumulative, with each update built upon all of the updates that preceded it", that "a device needs to install the latest update to remain supported", and that a device's ability to receive future updates will depend on hardware compatibility, driver availability, and whether the device is within the OEM's "support period"{{nsmdns}}a new aspect not accounted for in lifecycle policies for previous versions.&lt;ref name=computerworld-10years&gt;{{cite web|title=All editions of Windows 10 get 10 years of updates, support|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2949230/microsoft-windows/all-editions-of-windows-10-get-10-years-of-updates|work=Computerworld|date=July 17, 2015|publisher=[[IDG]]|accessdate=July 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-winasaservice" /&gt;&lt;ref name=cw-patchstick&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft swings security patch stick to keep customers up-to-date on Windows 10|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2935363/microsoft-windows/microsoft-swings-security-patch-stick-to-keep-customers-up-to-date-on-windows-10.html|website=Computerworld|date=June 13, 2015|publisher=[[IDG]]|accessdate=July 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cw-supportedlifetime&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft to provide free upgrades to Windows 10 for 2 to 4 years|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2945796/microsoft-windows/microsoft-to-provide-free-upgrades-to-windows-10-for-2-to-4-years.html|website=Computerworld|date=July 8, 2015|publisher=[[IDG]]|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was first invoked in 2017 to block [[Intel Clover Trail]] devices from receiving the Creators Update, as Microsoft asserts that future updates "require additional hardware support to provide the best possible experience", and that Intel no longer provided support or drivers for the platform. Microsoft stated that these devices would no longer receive feature updates, but would still receive security updates through January 2023.&lt;ref name="pcworld-clovertrail" /&gt;

=== Feature updates ===
{{Main|Windows 10 version history}}
Windows 10 is often described by Microsoft as being a "service", as it receives regular ''feature updates'' that contain new features and other updates and fixes.&lt;ref name=ars-winasaservice&gt;{{cite web |title=What Windows as a Service and a "free upgrade" mean at home and at work |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/07/what-windows-as-a-service-and-a-free-upgrade-mean-at-home-and-at-work/ |website=Ars Technica |accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-win10freefirstyear&gt;{{cite web |title=Windows 10 free for all Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 users for first year |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/01/windows-10-free-for-all-windows-8-1-and-windows-7-users-for-first-year/ |website=Ars Technica |date=January 21, 2015 |accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ms-nextgen&gt;{{cite web |last1=Myerson |first1=Terry |title=The next generation of Windows: Windows 10 |url=http://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/01/21/the-next-generation-of-windows-windows-10/ |website=Windows blog |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ms-serviceoverview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of Windows as a service|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/waas-overview|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, Microsoft stated that in the future, these updates would be released twice a year every March and September.&lt;ref name="verge-update sched"&gt;{{cite web|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=April 20, 2017|title=Microsoft will now release major Windows 10 updates every March and September|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/20/15374864/microsoft-windows-10-update-september-2017|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|access-date=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream builds of Windows 10 are labeled "''YYMM''", with ''YY'' representing the two-digit year and MM representing the month of release. For example, version 1809 was released in September (the ninth month) of 2018.

The pace at which feature updates are received by devices is dependent on which release channel is used. The default branch for all users of Windows{{nbsp}}10 Home and Pro is "Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted)" (formerly "Current Branch", or "CB"),&lt;ref name="ms-serviceoverview"/&gt; which receives stable builds after they are publicly released by Microsoft. Each build of Windows 10 is supported for 18 months after its original release.&lt;ref name="ms-serviceoverview" /&gt; In enterprise environments, Microsoft officially intends that this branch is used for "targeted" deployments of newly-released stable versions so that they can be evaluated and tested on a limited number of devices before a wider deployment. Once a stable build is certified by Microsoft and its partners as being suitable for broad deployment, the build is then released on the "Semi-Annual Channel" (formerly "Current Branch for Business", or "CBB"), which is supported by the Pro and Enterprise editions of Windows 10.&lt;ref name="ms-serviceoverview" /&gt;&lt;ref name=crn-updates /&gt;&lt;ref name="updates_infoworld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/2949622/microsoft-windows/windows-10-forced-updates-dont-panic.html|title=Windows 10 forced updates: Don't panic |first=Woody |last=Leonhard |date=July 17, 2015|work=[[InfoWorld]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|access-date=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semi-Annual Channel receives stable builds on a four-month delay from their release on the Targeted channel,&lt;ref name="ms-serviceoverview"/&gt; Administrators can also use the "Windows Update for Business" system, as well as existing tools such as [[Windows Server Update Services|WSUS]] and [[System Center Configuration Manager]], to organize structured deployments of feature updates across their networks.&lt;ref name="ms-serviceoverview" /&gt;&lt;ref name=crn-updates /&gt;

The Windows Insider branches receive unstable builds as they are released; it is divided into two channels, "Fast" (which receives new builds immediately after their release), and "Slow" (whose releases are slightly delayed from their "Fast" release).&lt;ref name="ms-serviceoverview" /&gt;

Enterprise licensees may use the Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC (formerly LTSB) edition, where "LTSC" stands for "long-term servicing channel", which only receive quality of life updates (i.e. security patches), and has a full, 10-year support lifecycle for each build.&lt;ref name="ms-serviceoverview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="updates_infoworld" /&gt; This edition is designed for "special-purpose devices" that perform a fixed function (such as [[automated teller machine]]s and medical equipment). For this reason, it excludes Cortana, Microsoft Store, and all bundled Universal Windows Platform apps (including but not limited to Microsoft Edge, hence these builds ship only with Internet Explorer as browser).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/some-windows-10-enterprise-users-wont-get-microsofts-edge-browser/|title=Some Windows 10 Enterprise users won't get Microsoft's Edge browser|last=Foley|first=Mary Jo|website=ZDNet|language=en|access-date=May 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/3250464/faq-windows-10-ltsb-explained.html|title=FAQ: Windows 10 LTSB explained|last=Keizer|first=Gregg|date=November 29, 2018|website=Computerworld|language=en|access-date=May 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ms-serviceoverview" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-winasaservice /&gt;&lt;ref name=cw-biggestchange&gt;{{cite web |title=Microsoft reveals biggest-ever change in Windows updates |url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2691211/microsoft-reveals-biggest-ever-change-in-windows-updates.html |website=Computerworld |date=October 3, 2014 |accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=winblog-w10forbusiness&gt;{{cite web |title=Introducing Windows 10 for Business |url=http://blogs.windows.com/business/2014/09/30/introducing-windows-10-for-business/ |website=Windows Blog |accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft director Stella Chernyak explained that "we have businesses [that] may have mission-critical environments where we respect the fact they want to test and stabilize the environment for a long time."&lt;ref name=iw-unanswered&gt;{{cite web |last1=Endler |first1=Michael |title=Windows 10: 5 Unanswered Questions |url=http://www.informationweek.com/software/operating-systems/windows-10-5-unanswered-questions/d/d-id/1316350 |website=InformationWeek |accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three LTSC builds have been released, correlating with the 1507, 1607, and 1809 versions of Windows 10, respectively.&lt;ref name="ltsbalertcw2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/3195318/microsoft-windows/enterprise-alert-microsoft-slates-next-windows-10-ltsb-release-for-2019.html|title=Enterprise alert: Microsoft slates next Windows 10 LTSB release for 2019|website=[[Computerworld]]|author=Gregg Keizer|date=May 9, 2017|accessdate=May 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thereg0918ltsc"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Speed |first1=Richard |title=Are you a Windows 1 in 10 (1809)?

In July 2017, Microsoft announced changes in the terminology for Windows branches, as part of its effort to unify the update cadence with that of [[Office 365]] ProPlus and [[Windows Server 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/07/microsoft-rationalizes-and-rebrands-windows-10-office-updates-again/|title=Microsoft rationalizes and rebrands Windows 10, Office updates again|work=Ars Technica|access-date=November 16, 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ms-serviceoverview" /&gt; The branch system now defines two paces of upgrade deployment in enterprise environments, "targeted" initial deployment of a new version on selected systems immediately after its stable release for final testing, and "broad" deployment afterwards. Hence, "Current Branch" is now known as "Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted)", and "Current Branch for Business" for broad deployment is now referred to as "Semi-Annual Channel".&lt;ref name=CB-CBB-LTSB-name-change&gt;{{cite web |title=The Windows Semi-Annual Channel and Targeted Deployment |url=https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/surface/2017/07/28/the-windows-semi-annual-channel-and-targeted-deployment/ |website=Surface blog on TechNet |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ms-serviceoverview"/&gt;

In February 2019, Microsoft announced changes again in delivering updates in beginning the next feature update: a single SAC will be released and SAC-T will be retired, and users are no longer able to switch to different channels. Instead, these updates can be deferred from 30, 60 or 90 days, or depending how the device was configured to deferred the updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-IT-Pro-Blog/Windows-Update-for-Business-and-the-retirement-of-SAC-T/ba-p/339523|title=Windows Update for Business and the retirement of SAC-T|date=February 14, 2019|website=Windows IT Pro Blog|publisher=Microsoft|language=en|access-date=February 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2019, it was announced that, in addition, feature updates will no longer be automatically pushed to users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18294944/microsoft-windows-10-may-2019-update-features-availability-control-updates|title=Microsoft's Windows 10 May 2019 Update puts you back in control of updates|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=April 4, 2019|website=The Verge|access-date=April 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feature updates prior to version 1909 are distributed solely as an in-place upgrade installation, requiring the download of a complete operating system package (approximately 3.5&amp;nbsp;GB in size for 64-bit systems). Unlike previous builds, version 1909 is designed primarily as an update rollup version of 1903, focusing primarily on minor feature additions and enhancements. For upgrades to 1909 from 1903, a new delivery method is used where its changes were delivered as part of the monthly cumulative update, but are left in a dormant state until the 1909 update "enablement" patch is installed. The full upgrade process is still used for those using builds prior to 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/3455227/microsoft-goes-very-small-for-windows-10-1909s-on-switch.html|title=Microsoft goes very small for Windows 10 1909's 'On' switch|last=Keizer|first=Gregg|date=2019-11-22|website=Computerworld|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/3453690/what-we-know-about-the-win10-version-1909-upgrade-and-what-you-can-do-about-it.html|title=What we know about the Win10 version 1909 upgrade — and what you can do about it|last=Leonhard|first=Woody|date=2019-11-15|website=Computerworld|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third stable build of Windows 10 is called '''version 1607'''. It was codenamed "'''Redstone 1'''" ('''RS1''') during development. This version is installed by the '''Anniversary Update''', which was released on August 2, 2016, a little over one year after the first stable release of Windows 10.&lt;ref name="ars-rsreleasedate"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bright|first1=Peter|title=Windows 10 Anniversary Update coming August 2 for 350 million Windows 10 users|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/06/windows-10-anniversary-update-coming-august-2-for-350-million-windows-10-users/|website=Ars Technica|publisher=Conde Nast Digital|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-anniupdate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="venturebeat-redstone"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft's codename Redstone is a Windows 10 update coming in 2016|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/04/07/microsofts-codename-redstone-is-a-windows-10-update-coming-in-2016/|website=VentureBeat|accessdate=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=softpedia-redstone&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft to Start the Next Windows 10 Chapter: Redstone|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/microsoft-to-start-the-next-windows-10-chapter-redstone-496458.shtml|website=Softpedia|accessdate=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Codename "Redstone" was originally thought to have been set aside for two feature updates.

The Anniversary Update introduces new features such as the Windows Ink platform, which eases the ability to add stylus input support to Universal Windows Platform apps and provides a new "Ink Workspace" area with links to pen-oriented apps and features,&lt;ref name="verge-winink"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft's new Windows Ink 'puts the pen front and center'|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/30/11327950/windows-ink-windows-10-update-pen-front-and-center|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-anniupdate" /&gt; enhancements to Cortana's proactive functionality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Myerson|first1=Terry|title=Windows 10 Anniversary Update brings New Experiences and Developer Opportunity|url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/03/30/windows-10-anniversary-update-brings-new-experiences-and-developer-opportunity/|work=Windows Experience Blog |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a dark user interface theme mode, a new version of [[Skype]] designed to work with the Universal Windows Platform, improvements to Universal Windows Platform intended for video games,&lt;ref name="ars-rsreleasedate" /&gt; and offline scanning using [[Windows Defender]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17466/windows-defender-offline-help-protect-my-pc "Help protect my PC with Windows Defender Offline"] Microsoft.

On new installations of Windows 10 on systems with secure boot enabled, all kernel mode drivers issued after July 29, 2015, must be digitally signed with an [[Extended Validation Certificate]] issued by Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Driver Signing changes in Windows 10, version 1607|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/windows_hardware_certification/2016/07/26/driver-signing-changes-in-windows-10-version-1607/|website=Windows Hardware Certification blog|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This version is the basis for "LTSB 2016", the first upgrade to the LTSB since Windows 10's release. The first LTSB release, based on RTM (version 1507), has been retroactively named "LTSB 2015".

Windows 10's privacy settings have more detailed explanations of data that the operating system may collect. Additionally, the "enhanced" level of telemetry collection was removed.&lt;ref name="ars-creatorsreview" /&gt; Windows Update notifications may now be "snoozed" for a period of time, the "active hours" during which Windows will not try to install updates may now extend up to 18 hours in length, and updates may be paused for up to seven days.&lt;ref name="ars-creatorsreview" /&gt; Windows Defender has been replaced by the universal app [[Windows Defender Security Center]].&lt;ref name="ars-creatorsreview" /&gt; Devices may optionally be configured to prevent use of software from outside of Microsoft Store, or warn before installation of apps from outside of Microsoft Store.&lt;ref name="Tung"/&gt; "Dynamic Lock" allows a device to automatically lock if it is outside of the proximity of a designated [[Bluetooth]] device, such as a smartphone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Notifications involving these contacts appear above their respective pictures, and users can communicate with the contact via either [[Skype]], e-mail, or text messaging (integrating with [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[Windows 10 Mobile]] devices).

It also introduces a new security feature known as "controlled folder access", which can restrict the applications allowed to access specific folders. This feature is designed mainly to defend against file-encrypting [[ransomware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/29/15892658/microsoft-windows-10-controlled-folders-feature|title=Windows 10 will hide your important files from ransomware soon|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=June 29, 2017|website=The Verge|access-date=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to new practices introduced after the problems affecting the 1809 update, Microsoft used an intentionally slower Windows Update rollout process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634343/microsoft-windows-10-may-2019-download-install-release|title=Microsoft's next major Windows 10 update is now available|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=May 21, 2019|website=The Verge|access-date=May 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/8/18300781/microsoft-windows-10-update-rtm-download-install-release-date-preview-may-2019|title=Microsoft releases final Windows 10 May 2019 Update to testers|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=April 8, 2019|website=The Verge|access-date=May 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/windows-10-may-2019-update-now-rolling-out-to-everyone-slowly/|title=Windows 10 May 2019 Update now rolling out to everyone... slowly|last=Bright|first=Peter|date=May 21, 2019|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=May 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New features in the update include a redesigned search tool—separated from Cortana and oriented towards textual queries, a new "Light" theme (set as default on Windows 10 ''Home'') using a white-colored taskbar with dark icons, the addition of symbols and [[kaomoji]] to the emoji input menu, the ability to "pause" system updates, automated "Recommended troubleshooting", integration with [[Google Chrome]] on Timeline via an extension, support for SMS-based authentication on accounts linked to Microsoft accounts, and the ability to run Windows desktop applications within the Windows Mixed Reality environment (previously restricted to universal apps and [[SteamVR]] only). A new feature on ''Pro'', ''Education'', and ''Enterprise'' known as Windows Sandbox allows users to run applications within a secured [[Hyper-V]] environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3363697/windows-10-may-2019-update-review.html|title=Windows 10 May 2019 Update review: Sandbox and a better Windows Update improve your PC|date=May 21, 2019|website=PCWorld|language=en|access-date=May 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/22/18635282/microsoft-windows-10-may-2019-update-features-review|title=Windows 10 May 2019 Update: the 10 best new features|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=May 22, 2019|website=The Verge|access-date=May 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A revamped version of Game Bar was released alongside 1903, which redesigns it into a larger overlay with a performance display, Xbox friends list and social functionality, and audio and streaming settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/22/18635709/microsoft-xbox-game-bar-windows-10-release|title=Microsoft's new Xbox Game Bar launches for Windows 10 as a useful overlay with widgets|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=May 22, 2019|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=November 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Version 1909 (November 2019 Update) ====
The ninth stable build of Windows 10, '''version 1909, codenamed "19H2"''', was released to the public on November 12, 2019 after being on the Insider Release Preview branch since August 26, 2019.

The tenth stable build of Windows 10, '''version 2004, codenamed "20H1"''', was released to the public on May 27, 2020 after being on the Insider Release Preview branch since April 16, 2020. New features included:     Faster and easier access to Bluetooth settings and pairing, improved Kaomojis, renamable virtual desktops, DirectX12 Ultimate, a chat-based UI for Cortana, greater integration with Android Phones on the Your Phone app, Windows Subsystem for Linux 2, the ability to use Windows Hello without the need for a password, improved Windows Search with integration with File Explorer, a cloud download option to reset Windows, and accessibility improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's New in the Windows 10 May 2020 Update|url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2020/05/27/whats-new-in-the-windows-10-may-2020-update/|website=Windows Blog|date=27 May 2020|accessdate=27 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 10 May 2020 Update release date, news and features|url=https://www.techradar.com/news/windows-10-20h1|date=27 May 2020|accessdate=27 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Features in development ===
In May 2017, Microsoft unveiled [[Fluent Design System]] (previously codenamed "Project Neon"), a revamp of [[Metro design language|Microsoft Design Language 2]] that will include guidelines for the designs and interactions used within software designed for all Windows 10 devices and platforms. The new design language will include the more prominent use of motion, depth, and translucency effects. Microsoft stated that the implementation of this design language would be performed over time, and it had already started to implement elements of it in Creators Update and Fall Creators Update.&lt;ref name="ars-fluentdesign"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Windows look and feel, Neon, is officially the "Microsoft Fluent Design System"|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/new-windows-look-and-feel-neon-is-officially-the-microsoft-fluent-design-system/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 2016, Microsoft announced that as part of a partnership with Qualcomm, it planned to introduce support for running [[Win32]] software on [[ARM architecture]] with a 32-bit x86 processor emulator, in 2017. Terry Myerson stated that this move would enable the production of [[Qualcomm Snapdragon]]-based Windows devices with cellular connectivity and improved power efficiency over Intel-compatible devices, and still capable of running the majority of existing Windows software (unlike the previous [[Windows RT]], which was restricted to Windows Store apps). Microsoft is initially targeting this project towards laptops.&lt;ref name="verge-w10armsoftware"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft is bringing Windows desktop apps to mobile ARM processors|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/7/13866936/microsoft-windows-10-arm-desktop-apps-support-qualcomm|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft launched the branding ''Always Connected PCs'' in December 2017 to market Windows 10 devices with cellular connectivity, which included two ARM-based 2-in-1 laptops from Asus and HP featuring the Snapdragon 835 system-on-chip, and the announcement of a partnership between AMD and Qualcomm to integrate its [[Qualcomm Snapdragon LTE modem|Snapdragon X16]] gigabit LTE modem with AMD's [[Ryzen Mobile]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/12119/microsoft-launches-windows-10-on-arm-always-connected-pcs|title=Microsoft Launches Windows 10 on ARM: Always Connected PCs|last=Howse|first=Brett|access-date=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/05/amd-qualcomm-always-connected-pc-ryzen-snapdragon/|title=AMD and Qualcomm join forces to power higher-end connected PCs|work=Engadget|access-date=December 5, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2019, Microsoft began testing changes to its handling of the user interface on convertible devices—downplaying the existing "Tablet Mode" option in favor of presenting the normal desktop with optimizations for touch when a keyboard is not present, such as increasing the space between taskbar buttons and displaying the [[virtual keyboard]] when text fields are selected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20839655/microsoft-new-tablet-experience-windows-10-convertible-hardware-desktop|title=Microsoft unveils new tablet experience for Windows 10|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=August 29, 2019|website=The Verge|access-date=August 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic hardware requirements to install Windows 10 were initially the same as for Windows 8.1 and Windows 8, and only slightly higher than Windows 7 and Windows Vista. As of the May 2019 update, the minimum disk space requirement has been increased to 32&amp;nbsp;GB. In addition, on new installations, Windows permanently reserves up to 7&amp;nbsp;GB of disk space in order to ensure proper installation of future feature updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-windows-10-to-grab-7gb-of-your-storage-so-big-updates-dont-fail/ |title=Microsoft: Windows 10 to grab 7GB of your storage so big updates don't fail |last=Tung |first=Liam |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=January 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/04/windows-10-may-2019-update-bumps-hardware-specs-needs-32gb-storage/ |title=Systems with small disks won't be able to install Windows 10 May 2019 update |last=Bright |first=Peter |date= April 26, 2019 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 64-bit versions require a CPU that supports certain instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/preview-faq-system-requirements-pc |title=Before you install |website=windows.microsoft.com |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131020309/http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/preview-faq-system-requirements-pc |archive-date=January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devices with low storage capacity must provide a USB flash drive or SD card with sufficient storage for temporary files during upgrades.&lt;ref name="thurrott-w10smallupdate"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/4547/upgrade-a-small-tablet-or-laptop-to-windows-10 |title=Upgrade a Small Tablet or Laptop to Windows 10 |last=Thurrott |first=Paul |date=July 9, 2015 |website=Thurrott.com |publisher=[[WP:SPS|Self-published]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pre-built devices may be described as "certified" by Microsoft. Certified tablets must include {{Keypress|Power}}, {{Keypress|Volume up}}, and {{Keypress|Volume down}} keys; {{Keypress|Win}} and {{Keypress|Rotation lock}} keys are no longer required.&lt;ref name="ndtv-specs"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/news/windows-10-minimum-hardware-requirements-and-upgrade-paths-detailed-672319 |title=Windows 10 Minimum Hardware Requirements and Upgrade Paths Detailed |last=Sinha |first=Robin |date=March 19, 2015 |website=[[NDTV]] |publisher=Red Pixels Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with Windows 8, all certified devices must ship with [[UEFI Secure Boot]] enabled by default. Unlike Windows 8, OEMs are no longer required to make Secure Boot settings user-configurable, meaning that devices may optionally be locked to run only Microsoft-signed operating systems.&lt;ref name="arstechnica-securebootw10"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/03/windows-10-to-make-the-secure-boot-alt-os-lock-out-a-reality/ |title=Windows 10 to make the Secure Boot alt-OS lock out a reality |last=Bright |first=Peter |date=March 20, 2015 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A supported infrared-illuminated camera is required for Windows Hello face authentication, and a supported fingerprint reader is required for Windows Hello fingerprint authentication.&lt;ref name="w10specs" /&gt; Device Guard requires a UEFI system with no third-party certificates loaded, and CPU virtualization extensions (including SLAT and [[Input–output memory management unit|IOMMU]]) enabled in firmware.

Beginning on Windows 10 version 2004, Microsoft will require new OEM devices to use 64-bit processors, and will therefore cease the distribution of x86 (32-bit) versions of Windows 10 via OEM channels.

== Reception ==
{{Main|Criticism of Windows 10}}
Critics characterized the initial release of Windows 10 in July 2015 as being rushed, citing the incomplete state of some of the operating system's bundled software (such as the Edge web browser), as well as the stability of the operating system itself on launch.&lt;ref name=ars-review /&gt;&lt;ref name="tr-review" /&gt;&lt;ref name=cw-rushed&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 10 is for suckers|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2953307/microsoft-windows/windows-10-is-for-suckers.html|accessdate=September 3, 2015 |first=Michael |last=Horowitz |date=July 28, 2015 |work=Computerworld |publisher=IDG }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''[[TechRadar]]'' felt that Windows{{nbsp}}10 would be "the new Windows{{nbsp}}7", citing the operating system's more familiar user interface, improvements to bundled apps, performance improvements, a "rock solid" search system, and the Settings app being more full-featured than its equivalents on{{nbsp}}8 and{{nbsp}}8.1. The Microsoft Edge web browser was praised for its performance, although it was not in a feature-complete state at launch. While considering them a "great idea in principle", concerns were shown for Microsoft's focus on the universal app ecosystem, noting that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It's by no means certain that developers are going to flock to Windows{{nbsp}}10 from [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] simply because they can convert their apps easily. It may well become a no-brainer for them, but at the moment a conscious decision is still required.&lt;ref name="tr-review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/operating-systems/windows-10-1267364/review/|title=Windows 10 Review|work=[[TechRadar]]|publisher=Future plc|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''[[Engadget]]'' was similarly positive, noting that the upgrade process was painless and that Windows{{nbsp}}10's user interface had balanced aspects of Windows{{nbsp}}8 with those of previous versions with a more mature aesthetic. Cortana's always-on [[voice detection]] was considered to be its "true strength", also citing its query capabilities and personalization features, but noting that it was not as pre-emptive as [[Google Now]]. Windows{{nbsp}}10's stock applications were praised for being improved over their Windows 8 counterparts, and for supporting windowed modes. The Xbox app was also praised for its Xbox One streaming functionality, although recommending its use over a wired network due to inconsistent quality over Wi-Fi. In conclusion, it was argued that "Windows{{nbsp}}10 delivers the most refined desktop experience ever from Microsoft, and yet it's so much more than that. It's also a decent tablet OS, and it's ready for a world filled with hybrid devices. And, barring another baffling screwup, it looks like a significant step forward for mobile. Heck, it makes the Xbox One a more useful machine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/07/28/windows-10-review/|title=Windows 10 Review|work=[[Engadget]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Ars Technica]]'' panned the new Tablet mode interface for removing the charms and app switching, making the Start button harder to use by requiring users to reach for the button on the bottom-left rather than at the center of the screen when swiping with a thumb, and for making application switching less instantaneous through the use of Task View. Microsoft Edge was praised for being "tremendously promising", and "a much better browser than Internet Explorer ever was", but criticized it for its lack of functionality on-launch. In conclusion, contrasting Windows{{nbsp}}8 as being a "reliable" platform albeit consisting of unfinished concepts, Windows{{nbsp}}10 was considered "the best Windows yet" and was praised for having a better overall concept in its ability to be "comfortable and effective" across a wide array of form factors, but that it was buggier than previous versions of Windows were on-launch.&lt;ref name=ars-review&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: Windows 10 is the best version yet—once the bugs get fixed|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/07/review-windows-10-is-the-best-version-yet-once-the-bugs-get-fixed/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[ExtremeTech]]'' felt that Windows{{nbsp}}10 restricted the choices of users, citing its more opaque setting menus, forcing users to give up bandwidth for the peer-to-peer distribution of updates, and for taking away user control of specific functions, such as updates, explaining that "it feels, once again, as if Microsoft has taken the seed of a good idea, like providing users with security updates automatically, and shoved the throttle to maximum."&lt;ref name=extremetech-privacysettings /&gt; Windows 10 has also received criticism due to deleting files without user permission after auto updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/243581/windows-10-may-delete-your-programs-without-asking/|title=Windows 10 May Delete Your Programs Without Asking|date=Jan 4, 2018|last=Hoffman|first=Chris|website=How-To Geek|access-date=Feb 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have noted that Windows{{nbsp}}10 heavily emphasizes [[freemium]] services, and contains various advertising facilities.

Up to August 2016, Windows 10 usage was increasing, with it then [[plateau effect|plateauing]]&lt;!--peaked in August at 24.43%, then again slightly up in October, for desktop numbers, but on all platforms going strictly down--&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://betanews.com/2016/10/01/wtf-windows-10-losing-share/ |date=October 1, 2016 |title=WTF?

=== Update system changes ===
Windows 10 Home is permanently set to download all updates automatically, including cumulative updates, security patches, and drivers, and users cannot individually select updates to install or not.&lt;ref name="ndtv-10removedfeatures"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Lists Features You'll Lose When Upgrading to Windows 10|url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/news/microsoft-lists-features-youll-lose-when-upgrading-to-windows-10-698973|website=NDTV Gadgets|publisher=New Delhi Television Limited|accessdate=June 3, 2015|date=June 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft offers a diagnostic tool that can be used to hide updates and prevent them from being reinstalled, but only after they had been already installed, then uninstalled without rebooting the system.&lt;ref name=iw-nvidiadriver&gt;{{cite web|title=On the road to Windows 10: Nvidia driver tests KB 3073930 patch blocker|url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/2952996/microsoft-windows/on-the-road-to-windows-10-botched-nvidia-driver-tests-kb-3073930-patch-blocker.html|first=Woody |last=Leonhard|website=[[InfoWorld]]|date=July 27, 2015|accessdate=July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iw-3073930&gt;{{cite web|title=On the road to Windows 10: Problems with forced updates and KB 3073930|url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/2951214/microsoft-windows/on-the-road-to-windows-10-problems-with-forced-updates-and-kb-3073930.html|first=Woody |last=Leonhard|website=[[InfoWorld]]|date=July 22, 2015|accessdate=July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Warren of ''[[The Verge]]'' felt that, given web browsers such as [[Google Chrome]] had already adopted such an automatic update system, such a requirement would help to keep all Windows{{nbsp}}10 devices secure, and felt that "if you're used to family members calling you for technical support because they've failed to upgrade to the latest Windows service pack or some malware disabled Windows Update then those days will hopefully be over."&lt;ref name=verge-forcedupdates&gt;{{cite web|last1=Warren|first1=Tom|title=Windows 10's forced automatic updates are a good idea|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/17/8987549/microsoft-windows-10-automatic-updates|website=The Verge|date=July 17, 2015|accessdate=July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns were raised that due to these changes, users would be unable to skip the automatic installation of updates that are faulty or cause issues with certain system configurations—although build upgrades will also be subject to public beta testing via Windows Insider program.&lt;ref name=iw-nvidiadriver /&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-forcedupdates /&gt; There were also concerns that the forced installation of driver updates through Windows Update, where they were previously designated as "optional", could cause conflicts with drivers that were installed independently of Windows Update. An example of such a situation occurred just prior to the general release of the operating system, when an [[Nvidia]] [[graphics card]] driver that was automatically pushed to Windows{{nbsp}}10 users via Windows Update caused issues that prevented the use of certain functions, or prevented their system from booting at all.&lt;ref name=iw-nvidiadriver /&gt;

Criticism was also directed towards Microsoft's decision to no longer provide specific details on the contents of cumulative updates for Windows 10.&lt;ref name=cw-culmwitheld&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 10 users beg Microsoft for more info on updates|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2983753/microsoft-windows/windows-10-users-beg-microsoft-for-more-info-on-updates.html|website=Computerworld|publisher=[[IDG]]|accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 9, 2016, Microsoft retracted this decision and began to provide release notes for cumulative updates on the Windows website.&lt;ref name="verge-w10history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft will stop hiding what's inside Windows 10 updates|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/9/10951228/microsoft-windows-10-update-history-site|first=Tom |last=Warren|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|date=February 9, 2016|accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some users reported that during the installation of the November upgrade, some applications (particularly utility programs such as [[CPU-Z]] and [[Speccy]]) were automatically uninstalled during the upgrade process, and some default programs were reset to Microsoft-specified defaults (such as Photos app, and Microsoft Edge for [[PDF]] viewing), both without warning.&lt;ref name=softpedia-th2removed&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 10 Threshold 2 Removes Some Desktop Programs During Install|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/windows-10-threshold-2-removes-some-desktop-programs-during-install-496120.shtml|website=Softpedia|accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 10 Threshold 2 Automatically Reinstalls All Previously Removed Apps|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/windows-10-threshold-2-automatically-reinstalls-all-previously-removed-apps-496165.shtml|first=Bogdan |last=Popa|website=Softpedia|date=November 14, 2015|accessdate=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, a Redstone 3 Insider build (which is known as ''rs_IoT'' on Mobile) was accidentally released to Insider as well as non-Insider users on all Windows 10 PCs and Mobile, but the update was retracted, with Microsoft apologizing and releasing a note on their Windows Insider Program blog describing how to prevent the build from being installed on their device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/2/15728254/microsoft-windows-10-development-branch-builds-release-mistake|title=Microsoft accidentally released internal Windows 10 development builds|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=June 2, 2017|website=The Verge|access-date=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dona Sarkar]], "because an inadvertent deployment to the engineering system that controls which builds/which rings to push out to insiders."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/06/01/note-unintentional-release-builds-today/#BDqet8EolwhsW8cM.97|title=A note about the unintentional release of builds today – Windows Experience BlogWindows Experience Blog|last=|first=|date=June 1, 2017|website=blogs.windows.com|language=en-US|access-date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Gartner]] analyst felt that Windows 10 Pro was becoming increasingly inappropriate for use in enterprise environments due to support policy changes by Microsoft, including consumer-oriented upgrade lifecycle length, and only offering extended support for individual builds to Enterprise and ''Education'' editions of Windows 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/3276278/microsoft-windows/windows-10-pro-is-a-dead-end-for-the-enterprise-gartner-says.html|title=Windows 10 Pro is a dead end for the enterprise, Gartner says|last=Keizer|first=Gregg|work=Computerworld|access-date=May 31, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have acknowledged that Microsoft's update and testing practices had been affecting the overall quality of Windows 10. In particular, it was pointed out that Microsoft's internal testing departments had been prominently affected by a major round of layoffs undertaken by the company in 2014. Microsoft relies primarily on user testing and bug reports via the Windows Insider program (which may not always be of sufficient quality to identify a bug), as well as correspondence with OEMs and other stakeholders. In the wake of the known folder redirection data loss bug in the version 1809, it was pointed out that bug reports describing the issue had been present on the [[Feedback Hub]] app for several months prior to the public release. Following the incident, Microsoft updated Feedback Hub so that users may specify the severity of a particular bug report. When announcing the resumption of 1809's rollout, Microsoft stated that it planned to be more transparent in its handling of update quality in the future, through a series of blog posts that will detail its testing process and the planned development of a "dashboard" that will indicate the rollout progress of future updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2878026/microsoft-to-business-dont-worry-about-windows-10-consumers-will-test-it.html|title=Microsoft to business: Don't worry about Windows 10, consumers will test it|last=Keizer|first=Gregg|work=Computerworld|access-date=November 13, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18090982/microsoft-windows-10-quality-focus-updates-2018|title=Microsoft to focus on Windows 10 quality after a buggy year|work=The Verge|access-date=November 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/10/microsofts-problem-isnt-shipping-windows-updates-its-developing-them/|title=Microsoft's problem isn't how often it updates Windows—it's how it develops it|work=Ars Technica|access-date=November 13, 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zdnet-quality"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/13/18090982/microsoft-windows-10-quality-focus-updates-2018|title=Microsoft to focus on Windows 10 quality after a buggy year|work=The Verge|access-date=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft was criticized for the tactics that it used to promote its free upgrade campaign for Windows 10, including [[adware]]-like behaviours,&lt;ref name=cw-forced10 /&gt; using deceptive user interfaces to coax users into installing the operating system,&lt;ref name="infoworld_2015_KB3035583" /&gt;&lt;ref name=infoworld-upgradetonight /&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-w10optional /&gt;&lt;ref name="infoworld_2016_KB3035583" /&gt; downloading installation files without user consent,&lt;ref name=pcw-didntask /&gt;&lt;ref name=cw-forced10 /&gt; and making it difficult for users to suppress the advertising and notifications if they did not wish to upgrade to 10.&lt;ref name=pcw-didntask /&gt;&lt;ref name=cw-forced10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=iw-banishing /&gt; The upgrade offer was marketed and initiated using the "Get Windows 10" (GWX) application, which was first downloaded and installed via Windows Update in March 2015.&lt;ref name="infoworld_2015_KB3035583"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2922604/microsoft-re-re-re-issues-controversial-windows-10-advertising-patch-kb-3035583.html|title=Microsoft re-re-re-issues controversial Windows 10 patch KB 3035583|last=Leonhard|first=Woody|date=May 15, 2015|work=[[Computerworld]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=April 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="infoworld_2016_KB3035583"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/3037393/get-windows-10-nagware-patch-kb-3035583-suddenly-reappears-on-win781-pcs.html|title=Get Windows 10 patch KB 3035583 suddenly reappears on Win7/8.1 PCs|last=Leonhard|first=Woody|date=February 24, 2016|work=[[Computerworld]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=April 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Windows Registry|Registry]] keys and [[Group Policy|group policies]] could be used to partially disable the GWX mechanism, but the installation of patches to the GWX software via Windows Update could reset these keys back to defaults, and thus reactivate the software.&lt;ref name=pcw-didntask /&gt;&lt;ref name=cw-forced10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=iw-banishing /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to manage Windows 10 notification and upgrade options|url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3080351|accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iw-banishing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/3020460/microsoft-windows/banishing-get-windows-10-nagware-isnt-as-easy-as-you-think.html|title=Banishing 'Get Windows 10' nagware isn't as easy as you think|last=Leonhard|first=Woody|date=January 8, 2016|website=InfoWorld|publisher=[[IDG]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218134635/http://www.infoworld.com/article/3020460/microsoft-windows/banishing-get-windows-10-nagware-isnt-as-easy-as-you-think.html|archive-date=December 18, 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=infoworld-upgradetonight /&gt; Third-party programs were also created to assist users in applying measures to disable GWX.&lt;ref name="computerworld_horowitz"&gt;{{cite web |last=Horowitz |first=Michael |title=Blocking Windows 10 with Never10 |work=[[Computerworld]] |publisher=[[IDG]] |date=March 31, 2016 |url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/3049996/windows-pcs/blocking-windows-10-with-never10.html |accessdate=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, it was reported that Microsoft was triggering automatic downloads of the Windows 10 installation files on all compatible Windows 7 or 8.1 computers configured to automatically download and install updates, regardless of whether or not they had specifically requested the upgrade. Microsoft officially confirmed the change, claiming it was "an industry practice that reduces the time for installation and ensures device readiness." This move was criticized by users who have [[data cap]]s or devices with low storage capacity, as resources were consumed by the automatic downloads of up to 6 GB of data. Other critics argued that Microsoft should not have triggered any downloading of Windows 10 installation files without user consent.&lt;ref name="cw-forced10"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2984312/microsofts-decision-to-pre-load-windows-10-upgrade-sans-consent-is-ill-advised.html|title=Microsoft's decision to pre-load Windows 10 upgrade sans consent is ill-advised|last=Keizer|first=Gregg|date=September 15, 2015|website=Computerworld|publisher=[[IDG]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pcw-didntask"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2983162/didnt-ask-for-windows-10-your-pc-may-have-downloaded-it-anyway.html|title=Didn't ask for Windows 10?

In October 2015, Windows 10 began to appear as an "Optional" update in the Windows Update interface, but pre-selected for installation on some systems. A Microsoft spokesperson said that this was a mistake, and that the download would no longer be pre-selected by default.&lt;ref name="ars-w10optional"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/10/windows-10-upgrade-installing-automatically-on-some-windows-7-8-systems/|title=Windows 10 upgrade installing automatically on some Windows 7, 8 systems|last=Bright|first=Peter|date=October 16, 2015|website=[[Ars Technica]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=April 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on October 29, 2015, Microsoft announced that it planned to classify Windows 10 as a "recommended" update in the Windows Update interface some time in 2016, which will cause an automatic download of installation files and a one-time prompt with a choice to install to appear.&lt;ref name=ms-makingeasier&gt;{{cite web|title=Making it Easier to Upgrade to Windows 10|url=http://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/10/29/making-it-easier-to-upgrade-to-windows-10/|accessdate=October 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-10autoupdate&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft planning to automatically offer Windows 10 to existing PCs|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/29/9639414/microsoft-windows-10-automatic-update-recommended|website=The Verge|date=October 29, 2015|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=October 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, it was reported that a new advertising dialog had begun to appear, only containing "Upgrade now" and "Upgrade tonight" buttons, and no obvious method to decline installation besides the close button.&lt;ref name="infoworld-upgradetonight"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/3015238/microsoft-narrows-win10-upgrade-options-to-upgrade-now-or-upgrade-tonight.html|title=Microsoft narrows Win10 upgrade options to 'Upgrade now' or 'Upgrade tonight'|last=Leonhard|first=Woody|date=December 15, 2015|website=[[Computerworld]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=April 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, some users also alleged that their Windows 7 and 8.1 devices had automatically begun upgrading to 10 without their consent.&lt;ref name="infoworld-w10withoutok"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft upgraded users to Windows 10 without their OK|url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/3043526/microsoft-windows/microsoft-upgraded-users-to-windows-10-without-their-ok.html|accessdate=March 15, 2016|work=[[InfoWorld]]|date=March 14, 2016|publisher=[[IDG]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, the GWX dialog's behavior changed to make closing the window imply a consent to a scheduled upgrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fearing forced Windows 10 upgrades, users are disabling critical updates instead|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3075729/windows/fearing-forced-windows-10-upgrades-users-are-disabling-critical-updates-at-their-own-risk.html|work=[[PC World]]|date=May 27, 2016|publisher=IDG|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seatimes-lawsuit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-draws-flak-for-pushing-windows-10-on-pc-users/|title=Microsoft draws flak for pushing Windows 10 on PC users|last1=Day|first1=Matt|date=June 28, 2016|website=Seattle Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, an ''[[InfoWorld]]'' editor disputed the claims that upgrades had begun without any consent at all; testing showed that the upgrade to Windows 10 would only begin once the user accepts the [[end-user license agreement]] (EULA) presented by its installer, and that not doing so would eventually cause Windows Update to time out with an error, thus halting the installation attempt. It was concluded that these users may have unknowingly clicked the "Accept" prompt without full knowledge that this would begin the upgrade.&lt;ref name="cw-nearnucular"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft takes Windows 10 upgrade near nuclear line|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/3081401/microsoft-windows/microsoft-takes-windows-10-upgrade-near-nuclear-line.html|website=Computerworld|date=June 10, 2016|publisher=IDG|accessdate=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, Microsoft chief marketing officer [[Chris Capossela]] admitted that the company had "gone too far", by using this tactic, stating that "we know we want people to be running Windows 10 from a security perspective, but finding the right balance where you're not stepping over the line of being too aggressive is something we tried and for a lot of the year I think we got it right."&lt;ref name="softpedia-"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.softpedia.com/news/microsoft-admits-it-went-too-far-with-aggressive-windows-10-updates-511245.shtml|title=Microsoft Admits It "Went Too Far" with Aggressive Windows 10 Updates|last=Popa|first=Bogdan|date=December 23, 2016|website=[[Softpedia]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 21, 2016, Microsoft was sued in [[small claims court]] by a user whose computer, shortly after the release of the OS, had attempted to upgrade to Windows 10 without her consent. The upgrade failed, and her computer was left in a broken state thereafter, which disrupted the ability to run her travel agency. The court ruled in favor of the user and awarded her $10,000 in damages, but Microsoft appealed. However, in May 2016, Microsoft dropped the appeal and chose to pay the damages. Shortly after the suit was reported on by the ''[[Seattle Times]]'', Microsoft confirmed that it was updating the GWX software once again to add more explicit options for opting out of a free Windows 10 upgrade;&lt;ref name="pcw-lawsuit"&gt;{{cite web|title=A lawsuit over an unwanted Windows 10 upgrade just cost Microsoft $10,000|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3088755/windows/a-lawsuit-over-an-unwanted-windows-10-upgrade-just-cost-microsoft-10000.html|website=PC World|date=June 27, 2016|publisher=IDG|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="infoworld-anotherchange"&gt;{{cite web|title=Get ready for yet another change to 'Get Windows 10' nagware|url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/3088901/microsoft-windows/get-ready-for-yet-another-change-to-get-windows-10-nagware.html|website=InfoWorld|date=June 28, 2016|publisher=IDG|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seatimes-lawsuit" /&gt; the final notification was a full-screen pop-up window notifying users of the impending end of the free upgrade offer, and contained "Remind me later", "Do not notify me again" and "Notify me three more times" options.&lt;ref name="zdnet-finalgwx"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft prepares one final, full-screen Get Windows 10 nag|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-prepares-one-final-full-screen-get-windows-10-nag/|website=ZDNet|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2019, Microsoft announced that it would display notifications on Windows 7 devices informing users of the upcoming end of extended support for the platform, and direct users to a website urging them to upgrade to Windows 10 or purchase new hardware. This dialog will be similar to the previous Windows 10 upgrade prompts, but not explicitly mention Windows 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18261699/microsoft-windows-7-notification-end-of-support|title=Windows 7 users to receive notifications from Microsoft about end of support|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=March 12, 2019|website=The Verge|access-date=March 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Privacy and data collection ===
Privacy advocates and other critics have expressed concern regarding Windows{{nbsp}}10's privacy policies and its collection and use of customer data.&lt;ref name=guardian-privacy&gt;{{cite web|first=Alex |last=Hern |title=Windows 10: Microsoft under attack over privacy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/31/windows-10-microsoft-faces-criticism-over-privacy-default-settings |accessdate=August 1, 2015 |work=[[theguardian.com]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the default "Express" settings, Windows{{nbsp}}10 is configured to send various information to Microsoft and other parties, including the collection of user contacts, calendar data, and "associated input data" to personalize "speech, typing, and inking input", typing and inking data to improve recognition, allowing apps to use a unique "advertising{{nbsp}}ID" for analytics and advertising personalization (functionality introduced by Windows 8.1)&lt;ref name=tnw-adid&gt;{{cite web |first=Ken |last=Yeung |title=Microsoft makes new ad platform SDKs available for Windows 8.1 to help Store developers monetize their apps |url=https://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2013/10/23/microsoft-makes-new-ad-platform-sdks-available-windows-8-1-help-store-developers-monetize-apps/ |website=The Next Web |date=October 23, 2013 |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allow apps to request the user's location data and send this data to Microsoft and "trusted partners" to improve location detection (Windows{{nbsp}}8 had similar settings, except that location data collection did not include "trusted partners"&lt;ref name=extremetech-privacysettings /&gt;). Users can opt out from most of this data collection,&lt;ref name=extremetech-privacysettings /&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-privacy /&gt; but telemetry data for error reporting and usage is also sent to Microsoft, and this cannot be disabled on non-Enterprise versions of Windows{{nbsp}}10.&lt;ref name=extremetech-privacysettings&gt;{{cite web |title=Windows 10s default privacy settings and controls leave much to be desired |url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/211208-windows-10s-default-privacy-settings-and-controls-leave-much-to-be-desired |website=[[ExtremeTech]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |accessdate=July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft's privacy policy states, however, that "Basic"-level telemetry data is [[Data anonymization|anonymized]] and cannot be used to identify an individual user or device.&lt;ref name=bott-is-windows-10-telemetry-a-threat&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bott |first1=Ed |authorlink1=Ed Bott |title=Is Windows 10 telemetry a threat to your personal privacy? |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/is-windows-10-telemetry-a-threat-to-your-personal-privacy/ |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=December 5, 2015 |date=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Cortana also requires the collection of data "such as Your PC location, data from your calendar, the apps you use, data from your emails and text messages, who you call, your contacts and how often you interact with them on Your PC" to personalize its functionality.&lt;ref name=guardian-privacy /&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-w10newnormal /&gt;

''[[Rock Paper Shotgun]]'' writer Alec Meer argued that Microsoft's intent for this data collection lacked transparency, stating that "there is no world in which 45{{nbsp}}pages of policy documents and opt-out settings split across 13{{nbsp}}different settings screens and an external website constitutes 'real transparency'."&lt;ref name=guardian-privacy /&gt; Joel Hruska of ''ExtremeTech'' writes that "The company that brought us the '[[Scroogled]]' campaign now [[The Hoover Company#The word "hoover"|hoovers]] up your data in ways that would make Google jealous."&lt;ref name=extremetech-privacysettings /&gt; However, it was also pointed out that the requirement for such vast usage of customer data had become a norm, citing the increased reliance on [[cloud computing]] and other forms of external processing, as well as similar data collection requirements for services on mobile devices such as [[Google Now]] and [[Siri]].&lt;ref name=guardian-privacy /&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-w10newnormal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/windows-10s-privacy-policy-is-the-new-normal/|title=Windows 10's privacy policy is the new normal|last=Bright|first=Peter|date=August 9, 2015|website=Ars Technica|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, Russian politician [[Nikolai Levichev]] called for Windows{{nbsp}}10 to be banned from use within the [[Russian government]], as it sends user data to servers in the United States. The country had passed a federal law requiring all online services to store the data of Russian users on servers within the country by September 2016, or be blocked.&lt;ref name="cnet-datalaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-gmail-skype-face-russia-ban-under-anti-terror-plan/|title=Facebook, Gmail, Skype face Russia ban under 'anti-terror' plan|last=Whittaker|first=Zack|date=July 23, 2014|work=[[CNET]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-datastoragelaw"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28173513|title=Russian MPs back law on internet data storage|last=|first=|date=July 5, 2014|newspaper=BBC News|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=May 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rt-10ban&gt;{{cite web|title=Senior Russian lawmaker seeks ban on Windows 10 in state agencies|url=https://www.rt.com/politics/313032-senior-russian-lawmaker-seeks-ban/|accessdate=August 23, 2015|work=RT|publisher=TV-Novosti}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[ZDNet]]'', Ed Bott said that the lack of complaints by businesses about privacy in Windows{{nbsp}}10 indicated "how utterly normal those privacy terms are in 2015."&lt;ref name=bott /&gt; In a ''[[Computerworld]]'' editorial, Preston Gralla said that "the kind of information Windows{{nbsp}}10 gathers is no different from what other operating systems gather.

The Microsoft Services agreement reads that the company's online services may automatically "download software updates or configuration changes, including those that prevent you from accessing the Services, playing counterfeit games, or using unauthorized hardware peripheral devices." Critics interpreted this statement as implying that Microsoft would scan for and delete [[Copyright infringement of software|unlicensed software]] installed on devices running Windows{{nbsp}}10.&lt;ref name="gamespot-w10pirated"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/windows-10-can-find-and-disable-pirated-games/1100-6429805/|title=Windows 10 Can Find and Disable Pirated Games|last=Hussain|first=Tamoor|date=August 17, 2015|website=[[GameSpot]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others pointed out that this agreement was specifically for Microsoft online services such as Microsoft account, [[Office 365]], Skype, as well as Xbox Live, and that the offending passage most likely referred to [[digital rights management]] on [[Xbox consoles]] and first-party games, and not plans to police pirated video games installed on Windows{{nbsp}}10 PCs.&lt;ref name=gamespot-w10pirated /&gt;&lt;ref name="idg-eulapiracy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2971088/windows/fears-of-microsoft-scanning-your-windows-10-pc-for-pirated-games-are-overblown.html|title=Fears of Microsoft scanning your Windows 10 PC for pirated games are overblown|last=Paul|first=Ian|date=August 17, 2015|website=[[PC World]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=May 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, some [[torrent tracker]]s announced plans to block Windows{{nbsp}}10 users, also arguing that the operating system could send information to anti-piracy groups that are affiliated with Microsoft.&lt;ref name=tf-w10ban&gt;{{cite web|title=Torrent Trackers ban Windows 10 over privacy concerns|url=https://torrentfreak.com/torrent-trackers-ban-windows-10-over-privacy-concerns-150822/|website=TorrentFreak|date=August 22, 2015|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing about these allegations, Ed Bott of ''ZDNet'' compared Microsoft's privacy policy to Apple's and Google's and concluded that he "[didn't] see anything that looks remotely like [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]."&lt;ref name=bott&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bott|first1=Ed|title=No, Microsoft is not spying on you with Windows 10|website=ZDNet|accessdate=September 4, 2015|date=August 27, 2015|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/no-microsoft-is-not-spying-on-you-with-windows-10/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columnist [[Kim Komando]] argued that "Microsoft might in the future run scans and disable software or hardware it sees as a security threat," consistent with the Windows{{nbsp}}10 update policy.&lt;ref name=komando&gt;{{cite web|last1=Komando|first1=Kim|title=3 Windows 10 privacy gotchas|url=http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20150902/PC05/150909997/1052/3-windows-10-privacy-gotchas|website=The Post and Courier|accessdate=September 12, 2015|date=September 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921230111/http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20150902/PC05/150909997/1052/3-windows-10-privacy-gotchas|archive-date=September 21, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
