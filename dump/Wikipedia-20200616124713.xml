[[File:S F-E-CAMERON Hatshepsut Hawk.JPG|thumb|Two images of Wadjet appear on this carved wall in the [[Hatshepsut]] Temple at [[Luxor]].]]
'''Wadjet''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɑː|d|ˌ|dʒ|ɛ|t}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|æ|d|ˌ|dʒ|ɛ|t}}; {{lang-egy|[[wikt:wꜣḏ#Etymology|wꜢḏyt]]}} "Green One"),&lt;ref&gt;Also spelled '''Wadjit''', '''Wedjet''', '''Uadjet''' or '''Ua Zit'''&lt;/ref&gt; known to the Greek world as '''Uto''' ({{lang-grc-koi|Οὐτώ}} {{IPAc-en|ˈ|uː|t|oʊ}}) or '''Buto''' ({{lang|grc|Βουτώ}} {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|uː|t|oʊ}}) among other names including Wedjat, Uadjet, and Udjo,&lt;ref&gt;Budge, E. A. Wallis (1969). Gods of the Egyptians, The (Studies in Egyptian Mythology)&lt;/ref&gt; was originally the ancient [[tutelary deity|local goddess]] of the city of Dep.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, ''Early Dynastic Egypt'', p.297&lt;/ref&gt; It became part of the city that the Egyptians named Per-Wadjet ("House of Wadjet") and the Greeks called [[Buto]] (now [[Desouk]]),&lt;ref&gt;''Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache'', 1, 268.18&lt;/ref&gt; which was an important site in [[prehistoric Egypt]] and the cultural developments of the [[Paleolithic]]. There was also a [[Per-Wadjet (Upper Egypt)|Per-Wadjet]] in Upper Egypt.

Wadjet was said to be the matron and protector of [[Lower Egypt]], and upon unification with [[Upper Egypt]], the joint protector and patron of all of Egypt.  The image of Wadjet with the sun disk is called the [[uraeus]], and it was the emblem on the crown of the rulers of Lower Egypt. She was also the protector of kings and of women in childbirth. Wadjet was said to be the nurse of the infant god [[Horus]]. With the help of his mother [[Isis]], they protected Horus from his treacherous uncle, [[Set (deity)|Set]], when they took refuge in the swamps of the [[Nile Delta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Wadjet|title=Wadjet {{!}} Egyptian goddess|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wadjet was closely associated in [[ancient Egyptian religion]] with the [[Eye of Ra]], a powerful protective deity. The hieroglyph for her eye is shown below; sometimes two are shown in the sky of religious images. Per-Wadjet also contained a sanctuary of Horus, the child of the sun deity who would be interpreted to represent the pharaoh. Much later, Wadjet became associated with Isis as well as with many other deities.

In the relief shown to the right, which is on the wall of the [[Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut]] at [[Luxor]], there are two images of Wadjet: one of her as the uraeus with her head through an [[ankh]] and another where she precedes a Horus hawk wearing the [[pschent]], representing the pharaoh whom she protects.

==Appearance==
[[File:Illustration from Pantheon Egyptien by Leon Jean Joseph Dubois, digitally enhanced by rawpixel-com 88.jpg|left|thumb|Wadjet illustration from ''Pantheon égyptien'' by Leon Jean Joseph Dubois.]]
As the patron goddess, she was associated with the land and depicted as a [[snake]]-headed woman or a [[snake]]&amp;mdash;usually an [[Egyptian cobra]], a venomous snake common to the region; sometimes she was depicted as a woman with two snake heads and, at other times, a snake with a woman's head. Her [[oracle]] was in the renowned temple in Per-Wadjet that was dedicated to her worship and gave the city its name. This oracle may have been the source for the oracular tradition that spread to Greece from Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus ii. 55 and vii. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|blue and green}}The Egyptian word ''[[wꜣḏ#Verb|wꜣḏ]]'' signifies blue and green. It is also the name for the well-known "Eye of the Moon".&lt;ref&gt;''Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache'' 1, 268.13&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in later times, she was often depicted simply as a woman with a snake's head, or as a woman wearing the uraeus. The uraeus originally had been her body alone, which wrapped around or was coiled upon the head of the [[pharaoh]] or another deity.

Wadjet was depicted as a cobra. As patron and protector, later Wadjet often was shown coiled upon the head of [[Ra]]; in order to act as his protection, this image of her became the uraeus symbol used on the royal crowns as well.

Another early depiction of Wadjet is as a cobra entwined around a papyrus stem, beginning in the Predynastic era (prior to 3100 B.C.) and it is thought to be the first image that shows a [[serpent (symbolism)|snake]] entwined around a staff symbol. This is a sacred image that appeared repeatedly in the later images and myths of cultures surrounding the [[Mediterranean Sea]], called the [[caduceus]], which may have had separate origins.

Her image also rears up from the staff of the "flagpoles" that are used to indicate deities, as seen in the [[hieroglyph]] for "uraeus" and for "goddess" in other places.

==Etymology==
{{Hiero|wꜣḏyt|&lt;hiero&gt;M13-M17-M17-X1-I12&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=right|era=egypt}}
{{Hiero|cobra+Sun|&lt;hiero&gt;N33*N33*N33:M13-X1*I13&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=right|era=egypt}}
{{Hiero|ḏt "cobra"|&lt;hiero&gt;I10&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=right|era=egypt}}
The name Wadjet&lt;ref&gt;''Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache'', 1, 268.17&lt;/ref&gt; is derived from the term for the symbol of her domain, [[Lower Egypt]], the ''[[papyrus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache'', 1, 263.7–264.4&lt;/ref&gt; Its hieroglyphs differ from those of the Green Crown or [[Deshret]] of Lower Egypt only by the determinative, which in the case of the crown was a picture of the Green Crown&lt;ref&gt;''Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache'', 1, 268.16;&lt;/ref&gt; and, in the case of the goddess, a rearing cobra.

She rises up on the left side of your head and she shines from the right side of your temples without speech; she rises up on your head during each and every hour of the day, even as she does for her father Ra, and through her the terror which you inspire in the spirits is increased … she will never leave you, are of you strikes into the souls which are made perfect. – The [[Book of the Dead]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tfwalsh.wordpress.com/2012/02/20/wadjet-cobra-goddess/|title=Wadjet – Cobra Goddess|date=2012-02-20|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Eventually, Wadjet was claimed as the patron goddess and protector of the whole of [[Lower Egypt]] and became associated with [[Nekhbet]], depicted as a [[Egyptian vulture|white vulture]], who held unified Egypt. After the unification the image of Nekhbet joined Wadjet on the crown, thereafter shown as part of the [[uraeus]].

Wadjet was associated with the Nile Delta region and was more associated with the world of the living. She was closely linked to pharaohs as a protective deity. She was associated, along with other goddesses, as the ‘eye of Ra’. Wadjet was often depicted as an erect cobra with its hood extended as though she were ready to strike. At times she was depicted wearing the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. Wadjet was depicted many times in her cobra form alongside her Upper Egyptian counterpart Nekhbet, in her vulture form wearing the Red Crown on wall paintings or on the pharaoh's headdress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oritkaye.wordpress.com/2011/07/07/nekhbet-and-wadjet/|title=Nekhbet and Wadjet|website=www.touregypt.net|language=ru|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wadjet, as the goddess of Lower Egypt, had a large temple at the ancient Imet (now [[Tell Nebesha]]) in the Nile Delta. She was worshipped in the area as the "Lady of Imet". Later she was joined by [[Min (god)|Min]] and [[Horus]] to form a triad of deities.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Razanajao, [http://athena.u-pec.fr/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=upec&amp;docId=aleph_upec_xml000570497&amp;fromSitemap=1&amp;afterPDS=true D'Imet à Tell Farâoun : recherches sur la géographie, les cultes et l'histoire d'une localité de Basse-Égypte orientale.] (English synopsis)&lt;/ref&gt;
