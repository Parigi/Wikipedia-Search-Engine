'''''Steve Jobs''''' is a 2015 British-American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[drama (film and television)|drama]] film directed by [[Danny Boyle]] and written by [[Aaron Sorkin]]. Adapted from the [[Steve Jobs (book)|2011 biography]] by [[Walter Isaacson]] and interviews conducted by Sorkin, the film covers 14 years (1984–1998) in the life of [[Apple Inc.]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]]. Jobs is portrayed by [[Michael Fassbender]], with [[Kate Winslet]], [[Seth Rogen]], [[Katherine Waterston]], [[Michael Stuhlbarg]], and [[Jeff Daniels]] in supporting roles.

Development began in 2011 after the rights to Isaacson's book were acquired. Filming began in January 2015. A variety of actors were considered and cast before Fassbender eventually took the role. Editing was extensive on the project, with editor [[Elliot Graham]] starting while the film was still shooting. [[Daniel Pemberton]] served as composer, with a focus on dividing the score into three distinguishable sections.

''Steve Jobs'' premiered at the [[Telluride Film Festival|2015 Telluride Film Festival]] on September 5, 2015, and began a [[limited release]] in New York City and Los Angeles on October 9, 2015. It opened nationwide in the U.S. on October 23, 2015 to critical acclaim. People close to Jobs such as [[Steve Wozniak]] and [[John Sculley]] praised the performances, but the film also received criticism for historical inaccuracy. Winslet won a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] and a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] for Best Supporting Actress and Sorkin won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay]] at the [[73rd Golden Globes]], while Fassbender and Winslet received nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], respectively, at the [[88th Academy Awards]].

== Plot ==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films are set between 400-700 words. --&gt;In 1984, the [[Macintosh 128K|Apple Macintosh 128K]]'s voice demo fails less than an hour before its unveiling at [[De Anza College|Flint Center]]. [[Apple, Inc.|Apple]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]] demands engineer [[Andy Hertzfeld]] to fix it, threatening to publicly implicate him in the presentation's credits if he does not. Hertzfeld finally suggests faking the demo using the prototype [[Macintosh 512K]] computer.

Jobs rants to marketing executive [[Joanna Hoffman]] about a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article exposing his paternity dispute with ex-girlfriend [[Chrisann Brennan]] – he denies he is the father of Brennan's five-year-old daughter, [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs|Lisa]]. Brennan arrives with Lisa to confront him – she is bitter over his denials and his refusal to support her despite his wealth. Jobs bonds with Lisa over her [[MacPaint]] art and agrees to provide more money and a house. Apple co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]] asks Jobs to acknowledge the [[Apple II]] team in his presentation, but Jobs feels that mentioning the computer (which he considers obsolete) is unwise.

By 1988, following the apparent failure of the Macintosh, Jobs has founded a new company, [[NeXT]]. Before the [[NeXT Computer]] launch at the [[War Memorial Opera House]], he spends time with 9-year-old Lisa, but his relationship with Brennan is still strained – he accuses her of irresponsible behavior and of using Lisa to get money from him. Wozniak arrives and predicts the NeXT will be another failure. Jobs confronts him about his public criticism of him, and Wozniak questions Jobs' contributions to computing history. Jobs defends his role as that of a conductor, who directs "musicians" like Wozniak.

Apple CEO [[John Sculley]] demands to know why the world believes he fired Jobs – Jobs was actually forced out by the Apple board, who were resolute on updating the Apple II following the Macintosh's lackluster sales. Jobs lambasted the decision and dared them to cast a final vote on his tenure, despite Sculley's warnings. After Hoffman and Jobs discuss NeXT's unclear direction, she realizes that Jobs has designed the computer to entice Apple to buy the company and reinstate him.

By 1998, Apple has fired Sculley, purchased NeXT, and named Jobs CEO, and Jobs is about to unveil the [[iMac G3|iMac]] at [[Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall|Davies Symphony Hall]]. He is delighted by Hoffman's strong commercial forecasts, but furious that Lisa has allowed her mother to sell the house Jobs bought for them. Hoffman reminds Jobs that he threatened to withhold Lisa's college tuition – Hertzfeld admits that he paid Lisa's tuition and suggested she attend therapy. Wozniak again asks that Jobs credit the Apple II team during the presentation, and again he refuses.

Sculley arrives in secret and the two make amends. Jobs and Sculley discuss Jobs' life as an adopted child, and Jobs admits that his need for control stems from his feelings of powerlessness in being given up. At the behest of Hoffman, Jobs apologizes to Lisa for his mistakes and accepts that he is her father, admitting that he is "poorly made." Lisa watches her father take the stage to introduce the iMac.

== Cast ==
* [[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Steve Jobs]]:

In regards to how he aimed to depict Jobs, Fassbender stated he aimed to depict Jobs as a "somebody who was passionate about his vision" as opposed to a cruel person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/10/12/michael-fassbender-steve-jobs-interview/73601092/ |first=Bryan |last=Alexander |title=Michael Fassbender portrays 'poorly made' Steve Jobs |date=October 12, 2015 |work=USA TODAY |accessdate=August 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111020933/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/10/12/michael-fassbender-steve-jobs-interview/73601092/ |archive-date=January 11, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kate Winslet]] as [[Joanna Hoffman]]:
:Apple and [[NeXT]] marketing executive and Jobs' confidant in the film.&lt;ref name="cast" /&gt; When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she "heard about it through a crew member who I happened to be working with [in Australia on ''[[The Dressmaker (2015 film)|The Dressmaker]]''], I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [Hoffman]. Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [producer] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part."&lt;ref name="Labrecque" /&gt; Winslet spent considerable time with [[Joanna Hoffman]] to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues."&lt;ref name="hoffman"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2015/08/kate-winslet-on-her-role-in-steve-jobs.html |title=How Kate Winslet Won a Role in Steve Jobs and Managed All That Sorkin Dialogue |accessdate=August 26, 2016 |last=Kachka |first=Boris |date=August 26, 2015 |work=Vulture |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618180609/http://www.vulture.com/2015/08/kate-winslet-on-her-role-in-steve-jobs.html |archive-date=June 18, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs.&lt;ref name="dbprem" /&gt; {{paragraph break}} On the nature of the relationship between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she "just wanted to please [Hoffman] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake."&lt;ref name=hoffman/&gt; Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman "did genuinely love [Jobs]. And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly."&lt;ref name="dbprem"/&gt;
* [[Seth Rogen]] as [[Steve Wozniak]]:
:Co-founder of Apple and creator of the [[Apple II]].&lt;ref name="cast"/&gt; Rogen admitted to not being familiar with Wozniak, let alone knowing he was co-founder of Apple. He met with Wozniak to prepare for the film, specifically picking up his tendency to move his hands around while speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.gq.com/story/steve-jobs-seth-rogen-qa |first=Lauren |last=Larson |title=Seth Rogen on Steve Jobs and Why He Has Mixed Feelings About Biopics |date=October 16, 2015 |work=GQ |accessdate=March 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fsteve-jobs-seth-rogen-qa&amp;date=2017-03-29 |archive-date=March 29, 2017 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCwozint"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-31463351 |title=Woz on watches, addiction and being played by Seth Rogen |accessdate=February 15, 2015 |last=Lobel |first=Mark |date=February 15, 2015 |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Ftechnology-31463351&amp;date=2016-09-04 |archive-date=September 4, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to Wozniak's relationship with Jobs, Rogen stated that "his feelings towards Jobs were very complex and interesting. Part of it was taking it at face value and part was reading between the lines."&lt;ref name="dbprem" /&gt; Wozniak stated that he felt honored to be portrayed by Rogen in the film.&lt;ref name="anyway" /&gt;
* [[Jeff Daniels]] as [[John Sculley]], CEO of Apple from 1983 to 1993&lt;ref name="cast"/&gt;
* [[Katherine Waterston]] as [[Chrisann Brennan]], Jobs' former girlfriend and Lisa's mother
* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as [[Andy Hertzfeld]], a member of the [[Macintosh 128K|original Mac]] team

To distinguish each of the three product launches depicted in the movie, Danny Boyle and cinematographer [[Alwin H. Küchler|Alwin Küchler]] implemented three different film formats: [[16mm film|16mm]] for 1984, [[35mm movie film|35mm]] for 1988, and [[Digital cinematography|digital]] for 1998. They also wanted each of the film's three time periods to visually reflect Jobs' own development at the time. For instance, Küchler explains that the filming at [[De Anza College|Flint Center, De Anza college]] for the first act combined the graininess of 16&amp;nbsp;mm film and setting to accentuate a provisional, spontaneous look – much in the vein of how Jobs is portrayed at that time. The third act, shot with an [[Arri Alexa]] at the [[Davies Symphony Hall]], incorporated an aesthetic and color palette that were intended to be representative of Jobs' own design philosophies of the [[iMac]] and subsequent [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] hardware. Küchler describes his experience filming ''Steve Jobs'' as "brilliant and challenging at the same time", and that the goal was to "make sure that the visuals kept up with the words", in reference to the production's collaboration between Boyle and Sorkin.&lt;ref name="boylewired"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/10/steve-jobs-danny-boyle-interview/ |title=Why Danny Boyle Filmed Steve Jobs in Three Different Formats |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=October 16, 2015 |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2F2015%2F10%2Fsteve-jobs-danny-boyle-interview%2F&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=September 3, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kuchlerthalo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thalo.com/articles/view/1143/steve_jobs_dp_alwin_h_kchler_shoots_in_three_acts |title=Steve Jobs DP Alwin H.

Costume designer [[Suttirat Anne Larlarb]] says the real Jobs never wore his trademark turtleneck jumper at any of the launches: "The turtleneck was the off book decision. In those 3 actual launches, in real life, he never wore that. In the 1998 portion of the film, in real life he was wearing a dark greyish/brownish suit. We made it for him as a back up idea in case we needed to adhere to it. As we got closer to the time of filming, I thought we'd set up rules for 1984, we'd set up rules for 1988 – there's so much of the film that's about design and he was about design."&lt;ref name="filmdoctor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmdoctor.co.uk/2015/12/01/steve-jobs-costume-designer-suttirat-larlarb-in-conversation|title=''Steve Jobs'' costume designer in conversation|website=filmdoctor.co.uk|date=December 1, 2015|accessdate=December 1, 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffilmdoctor.co.uk%2F2015%2F12%2F01%2Fsteve-jobs-costume-designer-suttirat-larlarb-in-conversation&amp;date=2016-09-03|archive-date=September 3, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fassbender also remarked that the historically inaccurate black turtleneck for the third act was intentional, believing that wearing the attire "felt like I had arrived at [Steve Jobs'] vision, that the person had arrived." Fassbender later added that he and [[Danny Boyle]] decided on this look during filming, and wanted to "give the audience kind of a payoff."&lt;ref name="fassbenderhuman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/01/05/how-michael-fassbender-made-steve-jobs-human.html |title=How Michael Fassbender Made Steve Jobs Human |first=Kevin |last=Fallon |work=[[Daily Beast]] |date=January 5, 2016 |accessdate=January 5, 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailybeast.com%2Farticles%2F2016%2F01%2F05%2Fhow-michael-fassbender-made-steve-jobs-human.html&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=September 3, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fassbenderpayoff"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/awards/michael-fassbender-portraying-steve-jobs-1201701595/ |title=Michael Fassbender on Finding the Essence of ''Steve Jobs''|first=Jenelle |last=Riley |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=February 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 17, 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2016%2Ffilm%2Fawards%2Fmichael-fassbender-portraying-steve-jobs-1201701595%2F&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=September 3, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-production ===
London-based studio Union created the film's [[visual effects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosser |first=Michael |url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/union-to-handle-vfx-on-danny-boyles-steve-jobs-biopic/5083638.article?blocktitle=Most-popular&amp;contentID=-1 |title=Union to handle VFX on Danny Boyle's Steve Jobs biopic |work=[[Screen International|ScreenDaily.com]] |date=February 26, 2015 |accessdate=March 3, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6kE6YBsof?url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/union-to-handle-vfx-on-danny-boyles-steve-jobs-biopic/5083638.article?blocktitle=Most-popular&amp;contentID=-1 |archive-date=September 2, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to editor [[Elliot Graham]], extensive film editing took place even before principal photography was completed. During the one-week rehearsal that took place in between production for each of the three acts (shot in chronological order), Graham worked on the existing footage and received ongoing feedback from Boyle in the editing room. In an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Graham said a particular challenge for him was balancing the [[Shot (filmmaking)#Film editing|shot frequency]] and providing enough "visual interventions" to control for Sorkin's dialogue-heavy screenplay. He described approaching each scene as "a series of fight sequences". Michael Fassbender provided multiple versions of his performance as Jobs, which Graham and Boyle then chose from during [[post-production]].&lt;ref name="boylecrave"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.craveonline.com/culture/912765-interview-danny-boyle-politics-steve-jobs |title=Interview Danny Boyle on the Politics of ''Steve Jobs''|last=Bibbiani |first=William |work=[[CraveOnline]] |date=October 16, 2015 |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.craveonline.com%2Fculture%2F912765-interview-danny-boyle-politics-steve-jobs&amp;date=2016-09-02 |archive-date=September 2, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grahamguild"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.editorsguild.com/FromTheGuild.cfm?FromTheGuildid=535 |title=From the Guild: Getting to the Core of Apple |last=Feld |first=Rob |publisher=[[Motion Picture Editors Guild]] |date=November 4, 2015 |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.editorsguild.com%2FFromTheGuild.cfm%3FFromTheGuildid%3D535&amp;date=2016-09-02 |archive-date=September 2, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/video/steve-jobs-editing-aaron-sorkin/ |title=Steve Jobs Editor on the Rush of Working With Aaron Sorkin Dialogue |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2Fvideo%2Fsteve-jobs-editing-aaron-sorkin%2F&amp;date=2016-09-02 |archive-date=September 2, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham also said: "Danny would be involved a lot but also take time away.

[[Daniel Pemberton]] composed the music for the film. Much like the film's visual approach, the score is divided into three distinguishable sections, each corresponding to the intended feel of the act in which the section is heard. "You have the first act which is analog," Pemberton explains, "you have the second act which is orchestral, and you have the third act which is digital." For the first act's composition, Pemberton primarily used analog synthesizers, in particular ones released no later than 1984 – the time the first act takes place – such as the [[Roland SH-1000]] and [[Yamaha CS-80]]. The second act's score is more operatic in nature, matching the setting of the [[War Memorial Opera House|San Francisco Opera House]]. Finally, the third act featured a more introspective score produced entirely digitally to complement its backdrop of the 1998 iMac product launch, and Pemberton correspondingly used his own iMac to compose this section.&lt;ref name="pembertonpop"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.popmatters.com/feature/a-symphony-in-three-parts-breaking-down-the-steve-jobs-score-with-composer-/ |title=Breaking Down the 'Steve Jobs' Score with Composer Daniel Pemberton |first=Cory |last=Woodroof |work=[[PopMatters]] |date=November 13, 2015 |accessdate=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.popmatters.com%2Ffeature%2Fa-symphony-in-three-parts-breaking-down-the-steve-jobs-score-with-composer-%2F+&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=September 3, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pembertonvariety"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/movie-maestros-mix-organic-and-synthetic-sounds-1201632653/ |title=Movie Maestros Mix Organic and Synthetic Sounds |first=Joe |last=Burlingame |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=November 3, 2015 |accessdate=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2015%2Ffilm%2Fnews%2Fmovie-maestros-mix-organic-and-synthetic-sounds-1201632653%2F&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=September 3, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pembertonclash"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clashmusic.com/features/daniel-pemberton-scoring-steve-jobs |title=Daniel Pemberton: Scoring Steve Jobs |first=Paul |last=Weedon |work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]] |date=November 18, 2015 |accessdate=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clashmusic.com%2Ffeatures%2Fdaniel-pemberton-scoring-steve-jobs&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=September 3, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deadlinepemberton"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2015/12/steve-jobs-composer-daniel-pemberton-oscars-2015-best-score-1201617583/ |title='Steve Jobs' Composer Daniel Pemberton Blended Nostalgia And Futurism |first=Anthony |last=D'Alessandro |work=[[Deadline (magazine)|Deadline]] |date=December 5, 2015 |accessdate=December 10, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdeadline.com%2F2015%2F12%2Fsteve-jobs-composer-daniel-pemberton-oscars-2015-best-score-1201617583%2F&amp;date=2016-09-03 |archive-date=September 3, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also noted that Boyle "drops his usual whirlwind editing style and instead develops an engrossing chamber piece."&lt;ref name=iw&gt;{{cite web|last=Kohn|first=Eric|url=https://www.indiewire.com/article/telluride-review-danny-boyles-steve-jobs-is-like-its-subject-flawed-but-fascinating-20150906|title=Telluride Review: Danny Boyle's ''Steve Jobs'' is Like Its Subject — Flawed But Fascinating|accessdate=September 6, 2015|date=September 6, 2015|work=[[IndieWire]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiewire.com%2Farticle%2Ftelluride-review-danny-boyles-steve-jobs-is-like-its-subject-flawed-but-fascinating-20150906&amp;date=2016-09-04|archive-date=September 4, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benjamin Lee of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the film three out of five stars, writing that "despite the film constantly informing you of just how incredibly important everything all is, it's disappointingly difficult to truly care about what's taking place."

=== Historical accuracy ===
[[Danny Boyle]], the film's director, speaking on the creative liberties he took with portraying Steve Jobs said, "[it] was what [[Shakespeare]] used to do. He would take some of the facts about a man of power and he would guess at a lot of the rest and just gotten away at actually getting at the human in it. And that's what's wonderful about the writing I think, is that it acknowledges the people who disliked Steve Jobs, the people he hurt. But in the end, he brings it back to a very simple father-daughter relationship that he has to admit that he has made some of the most beautiful things in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/danny-boyle-steve-jobs-interview/2/ |title=Interview: Director Danny Boyle Talks About The Making Of ''Steve Jobs''|last=Sciretta |first=Peter |work=[[/Film]] |date=October 15, 2015 |accessdate=November 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.slashfilm.com%2Fdanny-boyle-steve-jobs-interview%2F2%2F&amp;date=2016-09-04 |archive-date=September 4, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steve Wozniak]] (who consulted with Sorkin before he had written the screenplay) commented on a trailer released on July 1, 2015, that he does not "talk that way... I would never accuse the graphical interface of being stolen. I never made comments to the effect that I had credit (genius) taken from me...

[[File:VES Awards 89 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Pixar Animation Studios|Pixar]] co-founder [[Edwin Catmull]] was critical of the film's portrayal of Jobs, stating that he was kinder than how he was depicted.]]
[[Edwin Catmull]], president of [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]], felt that Jobs would "be appalled" at his depiction in the film, arguing that he was a kinder person later in life than is portrayed in the picture. In an interview with ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Catmull commented, "When [Jobs] left Apple, he then entered into what really is the classic [[hero's journey]]: He's wandering in the wilderness, he's working with NeXT, it's not working. He's working with Pixar, we're failing. In that process, Steve learned some major lessons, and he changed. He became an empathetic person, [...] that aspect of the change of Steve was missed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-pixars-ed-catmull-good-840292 |title=Disney-Pixar's Ed Catmull on 'Good Dinosaur,' Female Directors and Why Steve Jobs Would Be "Appalled" by 'Steve Jobs' |date=November 20, 2015 |last=Belloni |first=Matthew |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=November 21, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fnews%2Fdisney-pixars-ed-catmull-good-840292&amp;date=2016-09-04 |archive-date=September 4, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''[[Bloomberg West]]'' interview with [[Emily Chang (journalist)|Emily Chang]] on August 26, 2015, [[Andrea Cunningham|Andy Cunningham]] called it "a wonderful film.... It's an incredible character study of a really complex man. Aaron [Sorkin] and Danny Boyle did a fabulous job with it." Her portrayal by [[Sarah Snook]] was a "small role but professionally done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chang |first1=Emily |title=Andy Cunningham: What It Was Like Working With Steve Jobs |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-08-27/andy-cunningham-what-it-was-like-working-with-steve-jobs |website=Bloomberg |accessdate=August 27, 2015 |date=August 26, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Fvideos%2F2015-08-27%2Fandy-cunningham-what-it-was-like-working-with-steve-jobs&amp;date=2016-09-04 |archive-date=September 4, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also portrays Andy as participating in the iMac launch, even though she was not working with Apple at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Graham |first1=Jefferson |title=She was Steve Jobs' first publicist |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/09/06/she-steve-jobs-first-publicist/71787020/ |accessdate=September 12, 2015 |work=USA Today |date=September 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Ftech%2F2015%2F09%2F06%2Fshe-steve-jobs-first-publicist%2F71787020%2F&amp;date=2016-09-04 |archive-date=September 4, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Walt Mossberg]] compared ''Steve Jobs'' to the [[Orson Welles]] film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', which was loosely based on the life of [[William Randolph Hearst]]. Mossberg has stated that while both films are aesthetically well-developed, Welles created a fictional set of characters in order to clarify that his film was a work of fiction. In contrast, according to Mossberg (who knew Jobs for 14 years), Sorkin's decision to use real instead of fictional names detracts from the quality of a film which appears to be a biopic and yet is a work of fiction. Mossberg states that "the Steve Jobs portrayed in Sorkin's film isn't the man I knew. Sorkin chose to cherry-pick and exaggerate some of the worst aspects of Jobs' character, and to focus on a period of his career when he was young and immature [...] It would be as if you made a movie called ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' almost entirely focused on Kennedy's womanizing and political rivalries, and said nothing about civil rights and the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. Sorkin opts to end his story just as Jobs is poised to both reel off an unprecedented string of world-changing products and to mature into a much broader, kinder manager and person."&lt;ref name=mossberg&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/21/9578921/steve-jobs-movie-review-walt-mossberg |title=Mossberg: The Steve Jobs I knew isn't in this movie |accessdate=October 22, 2015 |last=Mossberg |first=Walt |date=October 21, 2015 |work=[[The Verge]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2015%2F10%2F21%2F9578921%2Fsteve-jobs-movie-review-walt-mossberg&amp;date=2016-09-04 |archive-date=September 4, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
