'''Madame X Tour''' was the eleventh [[concert tour]] by American singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], in support of her fourteenth studio album ''[[Madame X (album)|Madame X]]'' (2019). Consisting of 75 dates, the all-[[Theater (structure)|theatre]] tour started on September 17, 2019, in New York City, and concluded on March 8, 2020, in Paris. The tour was managed by [[Maverick (company)|Maverick]] and [[Live Nation Entertainment]].

This marked the first time the singer toured small venues since 1985's [[The Virgin Tour]]. Planned to only include theatres, the tour exclusively consisted of dates in the United States, England, France, and Portugal.&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/madonna-madame-x-tour-831602/ | title=Madonna Announces Intimate Theater Performances in 'Madame X' Tour | work=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=May 6, 2019 | access-date=May 6, 2019 | author=Shaffer, Claire }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8510115/madonna-tour-dates | title=Madonna Announces Intimate 'Madame X' Tour Dates | work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date=May 6, 2019 | access-date=May 6, 2019 | author=Kaufman, Gil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2019/music/news/madonna-reveals-madame-x-tour-dates-1203205856/ | title=Madonna Reveals 'Madame X' Tour Dates | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=May 6, 2019 | access-date=May 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to popular demand, new show dates were added in New York and Los Angeles, the same day the tour was officially announced.&lt;ref name="new"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/madonna---madame-x-tour-due-to-overwhelming-demand-additional-shows-just-announced-in-new-york--los-angeles-300844747.html|title=Madonna - Madame X Tour, Due to Overwhelming Demand Additional Shows Just Announced in New York &amp; Los Angeles|work=[[PR Newswire]]|date=May 6, 2019|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 20, 2019, the dates for the remaining US cities were officially announced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/madonna-extends-madame-x-tour-dates-837409/|title=Madonna Extends Madame X Theater Tour, Adds Residencies to Four More Cities|author=Kreps, Daniel|work=Rolling Stone|date=May 20, 2019|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on September 9, 2019, San Francisco was added to the itinerary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/09/09/madonna-brings-theater-tour-to-san-francisco-heres-how-to-get-tickets/|title=Madonna brings theater tour to San Francisco: Here's how to get tickets|author=Harrington, Jim|work=[[The Mercury News]]|date=September 9, 2019|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day before the tour officially started, two more shows were added in Miami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.miamiherald.com/miami-com/miami-com-news/article235172357.html|title=If you missed the chance to see Madonna's Miami residency, here's your shot|author=Ogle, Connie|work=[[Miami Herald]]|date=September 17, 2019|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Madonna first expressed interest in a smaller-scale show during an interview with [[BBC News]] while promoting the [[Rebel Heart Tour (album)|''Rebel Heart Tour'']] live album in September 2017. She said, "I've done so many shows—world tours, stadiums, sports arenas, you name it—that I feel like I have to reinvent that now too. I like doing intimate shows and being able to talk directly to the audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-41269047|title=Madonna: 'I want to reinvent pop tours'|first=Mark|last=Savage|work=[[BBC News]]|date=September 16, 2017|accessdate=May 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early May 2019, some media outlets reported that Madonna would announce a tour to support ''[[Madame X (album)|Madame X]]'' album, where she would play 'super small venues' across the United States, along with a few other more details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pagesix.com/2019/05/05/madonna-to-announce-new-madame-x-tour-on-monday/|title=Madonna to announce new 'Madame X' tour on Monday|author=Mohr, Ian|work=[[New York Post|Pagesix.com]]|date=May 5, 2019|accessdate=November 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their info was confirmed soon by Madonna herself, who announced it through a comedy video, posted on her social networks, where she was having a hangout with longtime collaborator [[Diplo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/app/noticia/diversao-e-arte/2019/05/06/interna_diversao_arte,753423/madonna-datas-da-turne-do-novo-disco.shtml|title=Madonna anuncia primeiras datas oficiais da turnê 'Madame X Tour'|trans-title=Madonna announces first official dates of 'Madame X Tour'|language=Portuguese|author=Moura, Izabella|work=[[Correio Braziliense]]|date=May 6, 2019|accessdate=November 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days prior to opening night, it was reported she would implement a no-phone policy in order to maximise the intimacy of the show and for people to concentrate on the art itself.&lt;ref name="yondr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailystar.co.uk/music/madonna-madame-x-tour-phones-19909670|title=Madonna bans all phones and cameras from her Madame X world tour|author=Hardwick, Jack|work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|The Daily Star]]|date=September 8, 2019|accessdate=September 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/entry/madonna-interdit-a-son-tour-les-portables-a-ses-concerts_fr_5d74f32de4b07521022e0e3b/|title=Madonna interdit à son tour les portables à ses concerts|trans-title=Madonna bans phones at her tour concerts|language=French|work=[[HuffPost|HuffPost France]]|date=September 8, 2019|accessdate=September 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this policy, Madonna partnered with [[Yondr]], which is a phone-sealing bag company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.papermag.com/madonna-madame-x-tour-2640455216.html|title=Madonna X-periments With the 'Madame X Tour'|author=Stern, Bradley|work=[[Paper (magazine)|Papermag.com]]|date=September 20, 2019|accessdate=November 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this has received mixed reactions from fans online.&lt;ref name="yondr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thatgrapejuice.net/2019/09/madonna-slammed-own-fans-for-banning-cell-phones-from-madame-tour/|title=Madonna slammed by own fans for banning cell phones from 'Madame X' Tour|author=Rashad|work=ThatGrapeJuice.net|date=September 8, 2019|accessdate=September 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This no-phone policy has been kept for both Lisbon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dn.pt/cultura/madonna-sem-jornalistas-nem-telemoveis-11697681.html|title=Madonna sem jornalistas nem telemóveis|trans-title=Madonna with no journalists nor cellphones|language=Portuguese|work=[[Diário de Notícias]]|date=January 12, 2020|accessdate=January 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt; and London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwtheatres.co.uk/whats-on/madonna/|title=Madonna - Madame X|work=[[Really Useful Group#LW Theaters|LW Theaters]]|date=January 23, 2020|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; batches of gigs.

Madonna made the following statement regarding the people who violated the no-camera policy: "Three shows into ''Madame X'' and I've enjoyed every minute of this intimate experience! I love looking into the audience and not seeing [[iPhone]]'s and cameras flashing but instead eyes, smiles and happy human faces. However I am mystified and confused by some people who insist on sneaking in second cameras and disregarding my request to not record the show. This request is common at all [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows, [[concert|dance concerts]], [[stand up comedy]] and the [[opera]]. People who ignore my request are not allowing themselves to enjoy the show completely but also show a lack of respect and consideration for my wishes. If you can't live without your phone for two hours this experience is not for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B2mlobsBDhi/|title=3 shows into Madame X (...)|work=Madonna's Official [[Instagram]]|accessdate=September 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to merchandise, Madonna announced a [[Pop-up retail|pop-up shop]] a week before the first show in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="popup"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iconvsicon.com/2019/09/12/madonnas-madame-x-tour-kickoff-to-feature-exclusive-pop-up-shop-in-nyc/|title=Madonna's Madame X Tour Kickoff to Feature Exclusive Pop-up Shop in NYC!|author=Price, Jason|work=Icon vs. Icon|date=September 12, 2019|accessdate=September 16, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, she collaborated with Too Faced cosmetics to release two make-up kits that are inspired by the make-up Madonna will be using during the shows.&lt;ref name="popup"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elle.com/uk/beauty/make-up/a29033155/madonna-too-faced-makeup-collection/|title=Everything You Need To Know About Madonna's Make-Up Collection With Too Faced|author=Bitmead, Charlotte|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle.com]]|date=September 13, 2019|accessdate=September 16, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar pop-up store has been open in Paris from March 4 to 14, 2020, during French batch of concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sortiraparis.com/interests/shopping-fashion/articles/210402-madonna-madame-x-mae-couture-the-pop-up-store-in-paris/lang/en|title=Madonna: Madame X Mae Couture, the pop-up store in Paris|author=Laura B.|work=sortiraparis.com|date=March 5, 2020|accessdate=March 8, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Madonna begun the tour rehearsals around late May 2019, by doing various workshops, where, among other stuff, the dancers, setlist and arrangements were chosen. By then, she documented her daily work through her [[Instagram]] social account, namely rehearsals. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx5M4b0h_lq/?hl=en-us|title=Life is a dark ballet. (...)|work=Madonna's Official Instagram|date=May 25, 2019|accessdate=October 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/ByGQWUWhvrV/?hl=en-us|title=Madame X is putting on her gloves (...)|work=Madonna's Official Instagram|date=May 30, 2019|accessdate=October 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her performance at [[Stonewall 50 - WorldPride NYC 2019]], the workshops also ended, and rehearsals went ahead with full choices made. This time, all daily work was being documented not only by Madonna herself, but also by her tour crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bzq3nqShE0v/?hl=en-us|title=Madame X is back to work (...)|work=Madonna's Official Instagram|date=July 7, 2019|accessdate=October 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BztDlQuhE63/?hl=en-us|title=Lisbon has arrived in Brooklyn (...)|work=Madonna's Official Instagram|date=July 9, 2019|accessdate=October 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the numerous videos and pictures that the singer posted, one of these included Madonna, joined by the Orquestra Batukadeiras, rehearsing her 1991 single, "[[Rescue Me (Madonna song)|Rescue Me]]", which had never been performed on a tour. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/news/8521139/madonna-teases-tour-rehearsal-video-rescue-me|title=Madonna Teases Tour Rehearsal Video for 'Rescue Me', Which She's Never Performed Live|author=Caulfield, Keith|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 18, 2019|accessdate=October 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This performance ended up being replaced for a video interlude instead. "Looking for Mercy" and "[[Rain (Madonna song)|Rain]]" were also rehearsed but didn't make the final cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B2YRsGWh-N7/?hl=en-us|title=You Never know when its going to rain (...)|work=Madonna's Official Instagram|date=September 14, 2019|accessdate=October 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional songs chronicled by her Instagram account that were rehearsed, but ultimately axed, included "[[You Must Love Me]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz_xpZdgIfE/?hl=en-us|title=Madame X (...)|work=Madonna's Official Instagram|date=July 16, 2019|accessdate=October 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[What It Feels Like for a Girl]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz8hd8KBA_n/?hl=en-us|title=What it feels like for a Girl?

Around late August, Madonna and her crew moved tour rehearsals to the BAM Howard Gilman Opera House, to complete the rehearsal process before the tour kicked off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B1rWptChj85/?hl=en-us|title=Madame X.

== Critical reception ==
[[File:Madame x - London Palladium.jpg|thumb|Madonna at London Palladium in 2020.]]
The first three nights of the show at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] were met with universal acclaim from critics. Leah Greenblatt from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated, "[...] when the construct of Madame X disappeared, what remained was something simpler and somehow much more satisfying than the equestrian or the cha-cha instructor or the saint (or even the mother, the magpie, the erstwhile standup comedian): Not just a pop star and perennial provocateur, but an artist in full."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/concerts/2019/09/20/madonna-madame-x-tour-review-brooklyn/|title=Madonna brings freewheeling intimacy to Madame X Tour|author=Greenblatt, Leah|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 20, 2019|accessdate=September 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon Pareles from ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: "As both album and show, "Madame X" is Madonna's latest declaration of a defiant, self-assured, flexible identity that's entirely comfortable with dualities [...] Yes, she is 61, but her music remains determinedly contemporary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/arts/music/madame-x-madonna.html|title=Madonna Is Still Taking Chances|author=Pareles, Jon|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 18, 2019|accessdate=September 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Sheffield from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' stated,  "Madonna has never shied away from taking chances. Thirty years after she set fire to [[1980s in music|the Eighties]] with the disco basilica Like a Prayer, she's as gloriously weird as ever. Hence her excellent new Madame X tour, a testament to the genius in her madness. [...] (Mentioning [[Bruce Springsteen]]) How gratifying that these two Eighties icons are not only still topping the charts, they're doing it with their wildest, most experimental work. We chose well when we picked these two as our heroes, right? As Madame X proves, Madonna will never be the kind of superstar who repeats her successes, sticks to her strengths, or plays it safe.
