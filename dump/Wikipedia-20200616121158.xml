Mission highlights included the initial 90-sol mission, finding extramartian [[meteorite]]s such as [[Heat Shield Rock]] (Meridiani Planum meteorite), and over two years of exploring and studying [[Victoria crater]]. The rover survived moderate dust storms and in 2011 reached [[Endeavour crater]], which has been described as a "second landing site".&lt;ref name=wustl/&gt; The ''Opportunity'' mission is considered one of NASA's most successful ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47231247 | title = Nasa calls time on silent Opportunity Mars rover | first = Jonathan | last = Amos | date = February 13, 2019 | access-date = February 14, 2019 | work = BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the [[Opportunity mission timeline#Dust storm|planetary 2018 dust storm]] on Mars, ''Opportunity'' ceased communications on June 10 and entered [[Safe mode (spacecraft)|hibernation]] on June 12, 2018.

[[File:PIA22222-Mars-OpportunityRover-FirstSelfie-20180220.jpg|thumb|left|''Opportunity''{{'}}s first self-portrait on Mars&lt;br /&gt;(February 14–20, 2018 / [[Sol (day on Mars)|sols]] 4998−5004)]]Collectively, the ''Opportunity'' and ''Spirit'' rovers were part of the [[Mars Exploration Rover]] program in the long-term [[Mars Exploration Program]]. The Mars Exploration Program's four principal goals were to determine if the potential for life exists on Mars (in particular, whether recoverable water may be found on Mars), to characterize the Mars climate and its geology, and then to prepare for a potential human mission to Mars. The Mars Exploration Rovers were to travel across the Martian surface and perform periodic geologic analyses to determine if water ever existed on Mars as well as the types of minerals available, as well as to corroborate data taken by the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]].&lt;ref name="nasa2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/science/objectives.html |title=The scientific objectives of the Mars Exploration Rover |publisher=marsrovers.nasa.gov |accessdate=May 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61AZSknZA?url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/science/objectives.html |archive-date=August 24, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' were launched a month apart, on June 10 and July 7, 2003, and both reached the Martian surface by January 2004. Both rovers were designed with an expected 90 [[Martian day|sols]] (92 Earth days) lifetime, but each lasted much longer than expected. ''Spirit''{{'s}} mission lasted 20 times longer than its expected lifetime, and its mission was declared ended on May 25, 2011, after it got stuck in soft sand and expended its power reserves trying to free itself. ''Opportunity'' lasted 55 times longer than its 90 sol planned lifetime, operating for {{age in days|2004|01|25|2019|02|13}} days from landing to mission end. An archive of weekly updates on the rover's status can be found at the ''Opportunity'' Update Archive.&lt;ref name="OpportunityUpdateArchive"/&gt; [[File:MOLA opportunity.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|''Opportunity''{{'}}s landing site (denoted with a star)|alt=|left]]

From its initial landing, by chance, into an [[Eagle (crater)|impact crater]] amidst an otherwise generally flat plain, ''Opportunity'' successfully investigated regolith and rock samples and took panoramic photos of its landing site. Its sampling allowed NASA scientists to make hypotheses concerning the presence of [[hematite]] and past presence of water on the surface of Mars.&lt;ref name="GZM-20190215"&gt;{{cite web |last=Dvorsky |first=George |title=The Enduring Mystery of the Martian 'Blueberries' Discovered by Opportunity Rover |url=https://gizmodo.com/the-enduring-mystery-of-the-martian-blueberries-discove-1832649426 |date=February 15, 2019 |work=[[Gizmodo]] |accessdate=February 15, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, it was directed to travel across the surface of Mars to investigate another crater site, [[Endurance (crater)|Endurance crater]], which it investigated from June to December 2004. Subsequently, ''Opportunity'' examined the impact site of its own [[heat shield]] and discovered an intact [[meteorite]], now known as [[Heat Shield Rock]], on the surface of Mars.

From late April to early June 2005, ''Opportunity'' was perilously lodged in a sand dune, with several wheels buried in the sand. Over a six-week period, Earth-based physical simulations were performed to decide how best to extract the rover from its position without risking its permanent immobilization. Successful maneuvering a few centimeters at a time eventually freed the rover, which resumed its travels.

''Opportunity'' was directed to proceed in a southerly direction to [[Erebus (crater)|Erebus crater]], a large, shallow, partially buried crater and a stopover on the way south towards [[Victoria (crater)|Victoria crater]], between October 2005 and March 2006. It experienced some mechanical problems with its robotic arm.

In late September 2006, ''Opportunity'' reached Victoria crater and explored along the rim in a clockwise direction. In June 2007 it returned to Duck Bay, its original arrival point; in September 2007 it entered the crater to begin a detailed study. In August 2008, ''Opportunity'' left Victoria crater for [[Endeavour (crater)|Endeavour crater]], which it reached on August 9, 2011.&lt;ref name="NASA – NASA Mars Rover Arrives at New Site on Martian Surface"/&gt;

Here at the rim of the Endeavour crater, the rover moved around a geographic feature named ''Cape York''. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter had detected [[phyllosilicate]]s there, and the rover analyzed the rocks with its instruments to check this sighting on the ground.
This structure was analyzed in depth until summer 2013. In May 2013 the rover was heading south to a hill named ''[[Solander Point]]''.

''Opportunity''{{'}}s total odometry by June 10, 2018 (sol 5111), was {{cvt|45.16|km}}, while the dust factor was 10.8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/mission/status_opportunityAll.html#sol4413|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Opportunity Updates|work=nasa.gov|accessdate=January 5, 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150830191319/http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/mission/status_opportunityAll_2011.html#sol4413|archive-date=August 30, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since January 2013, the solar array dust factor (one of the determinants of solar power production) varied from a relatively dusty 0.467 on December 5, 2013 (sol 3507), to a relatively clean 0.964 on May 13, 2014 (sol 3662).&lt;ref name="Opportunity Updates"/&gt;

In December 2014, NASA reported that ''Opportunity'' was suffering from "[[amnesia]]" events in which the rover failed to write data, e.g. [[telemetry]] information, to [[non-volatile memory]]. The hardware failure was believed to be due to an age-related fault in one of the rover's seven memory banks. As a result, NASA had aimed to force the rover's software to ignore the failed memory bank;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.discovery.com/space/mars-rover-opportunity-suffers-worrying-bouts-of-amnesia-141229.htm | title=Mars Rover Opportunity Suffers Worrying Bouts of 'Amnesia' | publisher=Discovery News | work=Web article | date=December 29, 2014 | accessdate=December 31, 2014 | author=O'Neill, Ian | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230215656/http://news.discovery.com/space/mars-rover-opportunity-suffers-worrying-bouts-of-amnesia-141229.htm | archive-date=December 30, 2014 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; amnesia events continued to occur, however, which eventually resulted in vehicle resets.{{clarify|date=February 2019}} In light of this, on Sol 4027 (May 23, 2015), the rover was configured to operate in RAM-only mode, completely avoiding the use of non-volatile memory for storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/mission/status_opportunityAll.html#sol4024|title=Opportunity Update Archive, sols 4024–4029, May 20, 2015–May 25, 2015|access-date=July 2, 2015|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150830191319/http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/mission/status_opportunityAll_2011.html#sol4024|archive-date=August 30, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific objectives of the Mars Exploration Rover mission were to:&lt;ref name="nasa1"/&gt;
* Search for and characterize a variety of rocks and regolith that hold clues to past water activity. In particular, samples sought include those that have minerals deposited by water-related processes such as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[Water vapor|evaporation]], [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary cementation]] or [[hydrothermal activity]].
* Determine the distribution and composition of minerals, rocks, and regolith surrounding the landing sites.
* Determine what [[Geology of Mars|geologic processes]] have shaped the local terrain and influenced the chemistry. Such processes could include water or wind erosion, sedimentation, hydrothermal mechanisms, volcanism, and cratering.
* Perform calibration and validation of surface observations made by [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] instruments. This will help determine the accuracy and effectiveness of various instruments that survey [[Geology of Mars|Martian geology]] from orbit.
* Search for iron-containing minerals, identify and quantify relative amounts of specific mineral types that contain water or were formed in water, such as iron-bearing carbonates.
* Characterize the [[mineralogy]] and textures of rocks and regolith  and determine the processes that created them.
* Search for geological clues to the [[Environmental science|environmental conditions]] that existed when liquid water was present.
* Assess whether those environments were conducive to life.

During the next two decades, NASA will continue to conduct missions with other spacecraft to address whether life ever arose on Mars. The search begins with determining whether the Martian environment was ever suitable for life. Life, as we understand it, requires water, so the history of [[water on Mars]] is critical to finding out if the Martian environment was ever conducive to life. Although the [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s did not have the ability to detect life directly, they offered very important information on the habitability of the environment in the planet's history.

''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' are twin rovers, each a six-wheeled, [[solar panel|solar-powered]] robot standing {{convert|1.5|m|ft|sp=us}} high, {{convert|2.3|m|ft|sp=us}} wide, and {{convert|1.6|m|ft|sp=us}} long and weighing {{convert|180|kg|lb}}. Six wheels on a [[rocker-bogie]] system enable mobility. Each wheel has its own motor, the vehicle is steered at front and rear and was designed to operate safely at tilts of up to 30 degrees. Maximum speed is {{convert|5|cm/s|in/s|sp=us}} although average speed was about a fifth of this ({{convert|0.89|cm/s|in/s|sp=us}}). Both ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' have pieces of the fallen [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]'s metal on them that were "turned into shields to protect cables on the drilling mechanisms".&lt;ref name="Martian Robots, Taking Orders From a Manhattan Walk-Up"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roving Mars: Spirit, Opportunity, and the Exploration of the Red Planet"/&gt;

Solar arrays generate about 140 watts for up to fourteen hours per sol, while rechargeable [[lithium ion batteries]] stored energy for use at night. ''Opportunity''{{'}}s onboard computer uses a 20&amp;nbsp;MHz [[IBM RAD6000|RAD6000]] CPU with 128&amp;nbsp;MB of DRAM, 3&amp;nbsp;MB of EEPROM, and 256&amp;nbsp;MB of flash memory. The rover's [[operating temperature]] ranges from {{convert|−40|to|+40|C|F}} and [[Radioisotope heater unit|radioisotope heaters]] provide a base level of heating, assisted by electrical heaters when necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://marsrover.nasa.gov/technology/is_severe_environments.html | title = MER – Batteries and Heaters | accessdate = August 13, 2012 | work = Jet Propulsion Laboratory | publisher = NASA | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120609205903/http://marsrover.nasa.gov/technology/is_severe_environments.html | archive-date = June 9, 2012 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A gold film and a layer of silica [[aerogel]] provides insulation.

Communications depend on an omnidirectional low-gain antenna communicating at a low data rate and a steerable high-gain antenna, both in direct contact with Earth. A low gain antenna is also used to relay data to spacecraft orbiting Mars.

Fixed science/engineering instruments included:
* [[Pancam|Panoramic Camera (Pancam)]] – examines the texture, color, mineralogy, and structure of the local terrain.
* [[Navcam|Navigation Camera (Navcam)]] – monochrome with a higher field of view but lower resolution, for navigation and driving.
* [[Mini-TES|Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES)]] – identifies promising rocks and regolith for closer examination, and determines the processes that formed them.
* [[Hazcam]]s, two B&amp;W cameras with 120 degree field of view, that provide additional data about the rover's surroundings.

The rover arm holds the following instruments:
* Mössbauer spectrometer (MB) [[MIMOS II]] – used for close-up investigations of the mineralogy of iron-bearing rocks and regolith.
* [[Alpha particle X-ray spectrometer]] (APXS) – close-up analysis of the abundances of elements that make up rocks and regolith.
* Magnets – for collecting magnetic dust particles
* Microscopic Imager (MI) – obtains close-up, high-resolution images of rocks and regolith.
* [[Rock Abrasion Tool|Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT)]] – exposes fresh material for examination by instruments on board.

The cameras produce 1024-pixel by 1024-pixel images, the data is compressed with [[ICER]], stored, and transmitted later.

The rover's name was chosen through a [[Mars Exploration Rover#Naming of Spirit and Opportunity|NASA sponsored student essay competition]].

''Opportunity'' was 'driven' by several operators throughout its mission, including JPL roboticist [[Vandi Verma]] who also cowrote the [[PLEXIL]] command language used in its software.&lt;ref name="sm2019"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Venkatraman |first1=Vijaysree |title=The space roboticist |url=https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2015/07/space-roboticist |website=Science magazine |date=July 13, 2015 |accessdate=February 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Earth, Mars has seasonal variations that reduce sunlight during winter.  However, since the Martian year is longer than that of the Earth, the seasons fully rotate roughly once every 2 Earth years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mars.nasa.gov/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1885|title=Mars Rover Opportunity Busy Through Depth of Winter – Mars News|last=mars.nasa.gov|work=nasa.gov|accessdate=January 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726141458/http://mars.nasa.gov/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1885|archive-date=July 26, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, MER-B had endured seven Martian winters, during which times power levels drop which can mean the rover avoids doing activities that use a lot of power.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; During its first winter power levels dropped to under 300 Wh per day for two months, but some later winters were not as bad.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Another factor that can reduce received power is dust in the atmosphere, especially dust storms.&lt;ref name="phys.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-10-europe-exomars-mission-middle-season.html|title=Europe's ExoMars mission arrives in the middle of dust season|work=phys.org|accessdate=January 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130091828/http://phys.org/news/2016-10-europe-exomars-mission-middle-season.html|archive-date=November 30, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dust storms have occurred quite frequently when Mars is closest to the Sun.&lt;ref name="phys.org"/&gt; Global dust storms in 2007 reduced power levels for Opportunity and Spirit so much they could only run for a few minutes each day.&lt;ref name="phys.org"/&gt; Due to the [[Opportunity mission timeline#Dust storm|2018 dust storms]] on Mars, ''Opportunity'' entered [[Safe mode (spacecraft)|hibernation mode]] on June 12,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/13/17460314/nasa-opportunity-rover-mars-dust-storm-battery-drained NASA's Opportunity rover is in a deep sleep on Mars – but there's hope it will wake up again] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614021406/https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/13/17460314/nasa-opportunity-rover-mars-dust-storm-battery-drained |date=June 14, 2018 }}.

''Opportunity''{{'}}s launch was managed by [[NASA's Launch Services Program]]. This was the first launch of the [[Delta II]] Heavy. The launch period went from June 25 to July 15, 2003. The first launch attempt occurred on June 28, 2003, but the spacecraft launched nine days later on July 7, 2003, due to delays for range safety and winds, then later to replace items on the rocket (insulation and a battery). Each day had two instantaneous launch opportunities. On the day of launch, the launch was delayed to the second opportunity (11:18&amp;nbsp;p.m. EDT) in order to fix a valve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harwood|first1=William|title=Opportunity launched to Mars|url=https://www.spaceflightnow.com/mars/merb/030707launch.html|website=Spaceflight Now|accessdate=December 18, 2015|date=July 8, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125022002/http://spaceflightnow.com/mars/merb/030707launch.html|archive-date=January 25, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 25, 2004, the airbag-protected landing craft settled onto the surface of Mars in the Eagle crater.

==Heat shield impact site==
In late December 2004, ''Opportunity'' reached the impact site of its heat shield, and took a panorama around Sol 325.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mer/images.cfm?id=1425|title=JPL.NASA.GOV: Mars Exploration Rovers|website=www.jpl.nasa.gov|access-date=February 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609070250/https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mer/images.cfm?id=1425|archive-date=June 9, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific findings ==
{{main|Scientific information from the Mars Exploration Rover mission}}
[[File:PIA07269-Mars Rover Opportunity-Iron Meteorite.jpg|thumb|[[Heat Shield Rock]] turned out to be the first meteorite discovered on Mars.]]
''Opportunity'' has provided substantial evidence in support of the mission's primary scientific goals: to search for and characterize a wide range of [[List of rocks on Mars#Opportunity|rocks]] and [[Martian soil|regolith]] that hold clues to past [[Water on Mars|water activity on Mars]]. In addition to investigating the water, ''Opportunity'' has also obtained astronomical observations and atmospheric data.

== Honors ==
Honoring ''Opportunity'''s great contribution to the exploration of Mars, an [[asteroid]] was named Opportunity: [[39382 Opportunity]].&lt;ref name="nasa12"/&gt; The name was proposed by [[Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld]] who, along with [[Cornelis Johannes van Houten]] and [[Tom Gehrels]], discovered the asteroid on September 24, 1960. ''Opportunity''{{'}}s lander is ''Challenger Memorial Station''.&lt;ref name="ChallengerMemorial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20040128a.html|title=Space Shuttle Challenger Crew Memorialized on Mars|accessdate=July 24, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616063929/http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20040128a.html|archive-date=June 16, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 28, 2014, it was announced that ''Opportunity'', having traversed over {{convert|25|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}, had become the rover achieving the longest off-world distance, surpassing the previous record of {{convert|39|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the [[Moon]] by [[Lunokhod 2]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20140728a"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Webster |first1=Guy |last2=Brown |first2=Dwayne |title=NASA Long-Lived Mars Opportunity Rover Sets Off-World Driving Record |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/140728192230.htm |date=July 28, 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=July 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728223809/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-245 |archive-date=July 28, 2014 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FRB-20140729"&gt;{{cite web |last=Knapp |first=Alex |title=NASA's Opportunity Rover Sets A Record For Off-World Driving |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2014/07/29/nasas-opportunity-rover-sets-a-record-for-off-world-driving |date=July 29, 2014 |work=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=July 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731081628/http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2014/07/29/nasas-opportunity-rover-sets-a-record-for-off-world-driving/ |archive-date=July 31, 2014 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
With word on February 12, 2019, that NASA was likely to conclude the ''Opportunity'' mission, many media outsides and commentators issued statements praising the mission's success and stating their goodbyes to the rover. One journalist, Jacob Margolis, tweeted his translation of the last data transmission sent by ''Opportunity'' on June 10, 2018, as "My battery is low and it's getting dark". The phrase struck a chord with the public mind and became widely reported, including some news reports that mistakenly asserted that the rover sent that English message, inundating NASA with additional questions. Margolis wrote a clarifying article on February 16, making it clear he had taken statements from NASA officials who were interpreting the data sent by ''Opportunity'', both on the state of its low power and Mars's high atmospheric opacity, and rephrased them in a poetic manner, never to imply the rover had sent the specific words.&lt;ref name="LAIST-20190216"&gt;{{cite news |last=Margolis |first=Jacob |title=How A Tweet About The Mars Rover Dying Blew Up On The Internet And Made People Cry |url=https://laist.com/2019/02/16/jpl_mars_rover_opportunity_battery_is_low_and_its_getting_dark.php |date=February 16, 2019 |work=[[Gothamist|LAist]] |accessdate=February 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190217100636/https://laist.com/2019/02/16/jpl_mars_rover_opportunity_battery_is_low_and_its_getting_dark.php |archive-date=February 17, 2019 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.newsweek.com/nasa-mars-opportunity-rover-new-york-daily-news-jet-propulsion-laboratory-1334615 | title = No, the Last Words of NASA's Opportunity Rover Weren't 'My Battery Is Low and It's Getting Dark'  |first= Aristos | last = Georgiou | date = February 18, 2019 | accessdate = February 18, 2019 | work = [[Newsweek]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
