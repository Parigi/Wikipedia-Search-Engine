After his death in 1896, the will of Swedish industrialist [[Alfred Nobel]] established the [[Nobel Prize]]s. Nobel's will specified that annual prizes are to be awarded for service to humanity in the fields of [[Nobel Prize in Physics|physics]], [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|chemistry]], [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|physiology or medicine]], [[Nobel Prize in Literature|literature]], and [[Nobel Peace Prize|peace]]. Similarly, the [[Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] is awarded along with the Nobel Prizes. Since the first award in 1901, the prizes have occasionally engendered criticism&lt;ref name="NobelC"&gt;[http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/3432 Nobel population 1901–50: anatomy of a scientific elite]. 5 November 2001. physicsworld.com. Retrieved 20 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and controversy.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article319509.ece A Nobel calling: 100 years of controversy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224170132/http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article319509.ece |date=24 December 2007 }}", The Independent, 14 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobel sought to reward "those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind". One prize, he stated, should be given "to the person who shall have made the most important 'discovery' or 'invention' within the field of physics". Awards committees have historically rewarded discoveries over inventions: 77% of Nobel Prizes in physics have been given to discoveries, compared with only 23% to inventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Christoph Bartneck  |author2=Matthias Rauterberg |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Physics Nobels should favour inventions|journal=Nature|volume=448|page=644|year=2007|doi=10.1038/448644c|issue=7154|pmid=17687300|bibcode = 2007Natur.448..644B|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1386/tear.6.1.73/1|url=http://www.bartneck.de/publications/2008/nobel/bartneckTechnoeticArts2008.pdf|journal=Technoetic Arts: A Journal of Speculative Research|volume=6|issue=1|year=2008|title=The asymmetry between discoveries and inventions in the Nobel Prize in Physics|author1=Christoph Bartneck  |author2=Matthias Rauterberg |lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the scientific prizes typically reward contributions over an entire career rather than a single year.

No Nobel Prize was established for [[mathematics]] and many other scientific and cultural fields.&lt;ref name=Morrill&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2975266|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|year=1995|volume=102|issue=10|title=A Nobel Prize in Mathematics|author=John E.

A major controversies-generating factor for the more recent scientific prizes (Physics, Chemistry and Medicine) is the Nobel rule that each award can not be shared by more than two different researches and no more than three different individuals each year.&lt;ref&gt;§4 of the Statutes, see https://www.nobelprize.org/about/statutes-of-the-nobel-foundation/#par4&lt;/ref&gt; While this rule was adequate at the moment of the institution of the Prize, when most of the science research was carried by individual scientists working with their small group of assistants in relative isolation, in more recent times science research have increasingly become a matter of widespread international cooperation and exchange of ideas among different research groups, themselves composed by dozens or even hundreds of researchers. This has led to glaring omissions of key participants in awarded researches: as an example see below the case of the 2008 Nobel Prize for Physics, or the case of the Atlas/CMS Collaboration that produced the scientific papers that documented the [[Higgs boson]] discovery and included a list of researchers filling 15 single-spaced pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican1012-12|title = Solve the Nobel Prize Dilemma|journal = Scientific American|volume = 307|issue = 4|pages = 12|year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/10/the-absurdity-of-the-nobel-prizes-in-science/541863/ |title = The Absurdity of the Nobel Prizes in Science|date = 3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/30/nobel-prize-fails-modern-science |title = Why Nobel prizes fail 21st-century science|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2008
The 2008 prize was awarded to [[Osamu Shimomura]], [[Martin Chalfie]] and [[Roger Y. Tsien]] for their work on [[green fluorescent protein]] or GFP. However, [[Douglas Prasher]] was the first to clone the GFP gene and suggested its use as a biological tracer. Martin Chalfie stated, "[[Douglas Prasher]]'s work was critical and essential for the work we did in our lab. They could've easily given the prize to Douglas and the other two and left me out."&lt;ref name="Gouveia"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081011/NEWS/810110328 |title=Shuttle driver reflects on Nobel snub |work=[[Cape Cod Times]] |author=Aaron Gouveia |date=11 October 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011230049/http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20081011%2FNEWS%2F810110328 |archivedate=11 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prasher's accomplishments were not recognized, and he eventually found himself out of a science career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2011/apr/30-how-bad-luck-networking-cost-prasher-nobel|title=How Bad Luck &amp; Bad Networking Cost Douglas Prasher a Nobel Prize |work=[[Discover Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Nobel was awarded in 2008, Prasher was working as a courtesy shuttle bus driver in Huntsville, Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Benderly |first1 = B.

;2007
[[Gerhard Ertl]], who received the entire 2007 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his studies of the catalytic effects of metal surfaces, has expressed surprise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/86/i14/Surface-Sciences-Sage.html|title=Surface Science's Sage – April 7, 2008 Issue – Vol. 86 Issue 14 – Chemical &amp; Engineering News|first=Mitch|last=Jacoby|website=cen.acs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and disappointment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/2007/10/birthday-boy-gets-nobel|title=Birthday Boy Gets a Nobel|date=10 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Gábor A. Somorjai|Gábor Somorjai]], a foundational pioneer in modern [[surface science]] and catalysis, did not share the prize. Somorjai and Ertl had previously shared the [[Wolf Prize]] for Chemistry in 1998.  The Nobel Prize committee's decision to exclude Somorjai was criticized in the surface-science community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2007/October/10100703.asp|title=Surface chemistry wins Nobel Prize}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remains mysterious.

;1993
The 1993 prize credited [[Kary Mullis]] with the development of the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) method. This is a central technique in [[molecular biology]] which allows for the amplification of specified DNA sequences. However, others claimed that Norwegian scientist Kjell Kleppe together with 1968 Nobel Prize laureate [[H. Gobind Khorana]], had an earlier and [[History of PCR|better claim]] to the discovery dating from 1969.&lt;ref name=Kleppe&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0022-2836(71)90469-4|author=K.

Khudyakov |author2=Howard A.

;1961

The 1961 prize for carbon assimilation in plants awarded to [[Melvin Calvin]] was controversial because it ignored the contributions of [[Andrew Benson]] and [[James Bassham]]. While originally named the [[Calvin cycle]], many biologists and botanists now refer to the Calvin-Benson, Benson-Calvin, or Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. Three decades after winning the Nobel, Calvin published an autobiography titled "Following the trail of light" about his scientific journey which didn't mention Benson.

'''1922 – 1946'''

From 1922 to 1946, [[Gilbert N. Lewis]], who was widely known for [[covalent bond]], [[electron pair]], [[Lewis structure]] and other seminal contributions, was nominated 41 times for Nobel Prize in Chemistry but never won.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/|title=Nomination Archive|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atomicheritage.org/profile/gilbert-n-lewis|title=Gilbert N. Lewis|website=Atomic Heritage Foundation|language=en|access-date=2019-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that while working in [[Walther Nernst]]'s lab, Lewis apparently developed a lifelong enmity with Nernst. In the following years, Lewis started to criticize and denounce his former teacher on many occasions, calling Nernst's work on his heat theorem "''a regrettable episode in the history of chemistry''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://listverse.com/2015/04/07/10-fierce-but-productive-rivalries-between-dueling-scientists/ ''10 Fierce (But Productive) Rivalries Between Dueling Scientists''] Radu Alexander. Website of Listverse Ltd. April 7th 2015. Retrieved 2016-03-24.&lt;/ref&gt; A friend of Nernst's, [[:sv:Wilhelm Palmær|Wilhelm Palmær (Swedish)]], was a member of the Nobel Chemistry Committee. There is evidence that he used the Nobel nominating and reporting procedures to block a Nobel Prize for Lewis in [[thermodynamics]] by nominating Lewis for the prize three times, and then using his position as a committee member to write negative reports.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey (2008): 195–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Others
* [[Henry Eyring (chemist)|Henry Eyring]] (1901–1981) allegedly failed to receive the prize because of his membership in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].&lt;ref&gt;''Matters of Conscience: Conversations With Sterling M. McMurrin on Philosophy, Education, and Religion'' by [[Sterling M. McMurrin]] &amp; L. Jackson Newell, [[Signature Books]], 1996&lt;/ref&gt; (It is also possible that the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] did not understand Eyring's theory until it was too late to award him the Nobel; the academy awarded him the Berzelius Medal in 1977 as partial compensation.&lt;ref name="malmstromandersson"&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20060405023917/http://nobelprize.org/ The Nobel Prize in Chemistry: The Development of Modern Chemistry]".

* [[Dmitri Mendeleyev]], who originated the [[periodic table]] of the [[chemical element|elements]], never received a Nobel Prize. He completed his first periodic table in 1869. However, a year earlier, another chemist, [[Julius Lothar Meyer]], had reported a somewhat similar table. In 1866, [[John Alexander Reina Newlands]], presented a paper that first proposed a periodic law. However, none of these tables were correct—the 19th century tables arranged the elements in order of increasing atomic weight (or [[atomic mass]]). It was left to the English physicist [[Henry Moseley]] to base the periodic table on the [[atomic number]] (the number of protons). Mendeleyev died in 1907, six years after the first Nobel Prizes were awarded. He came within one vote of winning in 1906, but died the next year. Hargittai claimed that Mendeleyev's omission was due to behind-the-scenes machinations of one dissenter on the Nobel Committee who disagreed with his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/roadtostockholmn00harg |title=The Road to Stockholm: Nobel Prizes, Science, and Scientists (Hardcover) |isbn=019850912X |publisher=Brightsurf.com |accessdate=18 October 2009 |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
{{See also|Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences#Controversies and criticisms}}
Economics was not on Nobel's original list of prize disciplines. Sweden's central bank [[Sveriges Riksbank]] created the [[Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] in 1969. Although it is governed by the same rules as the others, many, including members of the Nobel family, criticized this prize for violating Nobel's intent. {{As of|2010}}, the faculty of the [[University of Chicago]] had garnered nine Prizes—far more than any other university. This led to claims of bias against alternative or [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] economics.{{who|date=November 2009}}

;2008
The 2008 prize went to economist [[Paul Krugman]] "for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity". Krugman was a fierce critic of [[George W. Bush]]. The award produced charges of a left-wing bias, with headlines such as "Bush critic wins 2008 Nobel for economics", prompting the prize committee to deny "the committee has ever taken a political stance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author = Anna Ringstrom, Sven Nordenstam and Jon Hurdle |title=Bush critic wins 2008 Nobel for economics |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE49C37520081013 |work=Reuters |date=13 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1994 prize to [[John Forbes Nash]] and others "for their pioneering analysis of equilibria in the [[game theory|theory of non-cooperative games]]" caused controversy within the selection committee because of Nash's [[Schizophrenia|mental illness]] and alleged [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refNasarmind|Nasar, ''A Beautiful Mind'']], p. 356–373&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy resulted in a change to the governing committee: members served three year instead of unlimited terms&lt;ref name=nasarmind372/&gt; and the prize's scope expanded to include political science, psychology, and sociology.&lt;ref name=nasarmind372&gt;[[#refNasarmind|Nasar, ''A Beautiful Mind'']], p. 372&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=notnoble&gt;{{Cite news|author = Samuel Brittan|author-link = Samuel Brittan|title = The not so noble Nobel Prize|newspaper = [[Financial Times]]|date = 19 December 2003|url = http://www.samuelbrittan.co.uk/text172_p.html|accessdate = 26 November 2009|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090630015308/http://www.samuelbrittan.co.uk/text172_p.html|archivedate = 30 June 2009|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;1976
The 1976 prize was awarded to [[Milton Friedman]] "for his achievements in the fields of consumption analysis, monetary history and theory and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilisation policy".

==Literature==
The Prize in Literature has a history of controversial awards and notorious snubs. Many indisputably major authors have been ignored by the Nobel Committee, possibly for political or extra-literary reasons.&lt;ref name=Kehe&gt;{{cite news |first=Marjorie |last=Kehe |url=http://features.csmonitor.com/books/2008/10/02/are-us-writers-unworthy-of-the-nobel-prize/ |title=Are US Writers Unworthy of the Nobel Prize? |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=2 October 2008 |accessdate=15 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1901 to 1912, the committee's work reflected an interpretation of the "ideal direction" stated in Nobel's will as "a lofty and sound idealism", which caused [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Émile Zola]] and [[Mark Twain]] to be rejected. Sweden's historic antipathy towards Russia was cited as the reason neither Tolstoy nor [[Anton Chekhov]] took the prize. During World War I and its immediate aftermath, the committee adopted a policy of neutrality, favouring writers from non-combatant countries.&lt;ref name=Espmark&gt;{{Cite news |author=Kjell Espmark |title=The Nobel Prize in Literature |url=http://nobelprize.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060405023917/http://nobelprize.org/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 April 2006 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=3 December 1999 |accessdate=14 August 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable omission for the Prize is [[R. K. Narayan]], an Indian writer known for his works set in the fictional South Indian town of [[Malgudi]] and the abridged versions of the Indian epics – ''[[The Ramayana (Narayan book)|The Ramayana]]'' and ''[[The Mahabharata (Narayan book)|The Mahabharata]]''. Despite being nominated and shortlisted for the Nobel Prize in Literature multiple times,&lt;ref name="The Grand Old Man of Malgudi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20001007/windows/main1.htm|title=The Grand Old Man of Malgudi|date=7 October 2000|newspaper=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narayan never won the honour. [[Graham Greene]], who took it upon himself to work as Narayan's agent for his works, in the 60s expressed confidence that Narayan would one day win the Nobel Prize.&lt;ref name="The Grand Old Man of Malgudi"/&gt; Agreeing with Greene's views, Lord Jeffrey Archer as much as recently, echoed that R.

The heavy focus on European authors, and Swedes in particular, is the subject of mounting criticism, including from major Swedish newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Dagens Nyheter (8 October 2008){{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=3462&amp;a=837512 |title=Akademien väljer helst en europé (The Academy prefers to pick a European) |accessdate=12 February 2010 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210161355/http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=3462&amp;a=837512 |archivedate=10 February 2009}} . dn.se&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the laureates have been European. Swedes have received more prizes than all of Asia. In 2008, [[Horace Engdahl]], then the permanent secretary of the Academy, declared that "Europe still is the center of the literary world" and that "the US is too isolated, too insular. They don't translate enough and don't really participate in the big dialogue of literature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://slate.com/culture/2008/10/the-nobel-committee-has-no-clue-about-american-literature.html |title=Nobel Gas: The Nobel Committee has no clue about American literature |work=[[Slate.com]] |accessdate=2013-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Engdahl's replacement, [[Peter Englund]], rejected this sentiment ("In most language areas ... there are authors that really deserve and could get the Nobel Prize and that goes for the United States and the Americas, as well,") and acknowledged the Eurocentric bias of the selections, saying that, "I think that is a problem. We tend to relate more easily to literature written in Europe and in the European tradition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8742797 |title=Judge: Nobel literature prizes 'too Eurocentric' |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=6 October 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 prize awarded to  [[Bob Dylan]] was controversial. This was the first time a songwriter musician had been awarded the prize.

However others noted that poetry has long been recognized, focused on the underlying merit of Dylan's award, and speculated that the popularity of Dylan's work was behind those objecting.

;2005
The 2005 prize went to [[Harold Pinter]] "who in his plays uncovers the precipice under everyday prattle and forces entry into oppression's closed rooms". The award was delayed for some days, apparently due to [[Knut Ahnlund]]'s resignation. In turn, this renewed speculation about a "political element" existing in the Swedish Academy's awarding of the Prize.&lt;ref name=NSmith&gt;{{cite news|author=Neil Smith|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4339096.stm |title='Political element' to Pinter Prize |work=[[BBC News]] |date=13 October 2005 |accessdate=26 April 2008 |quote=Few people would deny Harold Pinter is a worthy recipient of the 2005 Nobel Prize for Literature. As a poet, screenwriter and author of more than 30 plays, he has dominated the English literary scene for half a century. However, his outspoken criticism of US [[foreign policy]] and opposition to [[2003 invasion of Iraq|the war in Iraq]] undoubtedly make him one of the more controversial figures to be awarded this prestigious honour. Indeed, the Nobel academy's decision can be read to have an inescapably political element. 'There is the view that the Nobel Literature Prize often goes to someone whose political stance is found to be sympathetic at a given moment,' said Alan Jenkins, deputy editor of [[the Times Literary Supplement]]. 'For the last 10 years he has been more angry and vituperative, and that cannot have failed to be noticed.' However, Mr Jenkins insists that, though Pinter's political views may have been a factor, the award is more than justified on artistic criteria alone. 'His dramatic and literary achievement is head and shoulders above any other British writer. He is far and away the most interesting, the best, the most powerful and most original of English playwrights.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although poor health prevented him from giving his controversial Nobel Lecture, "[[Art, Truth and Politics]]", in person, he appeared on video, which was simultaneously transmitted on Britain's [[Channel Four]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060405023917/http://nobelprize.org/ Harold Pinter –Nobel Lecture].

===2012===
The [[2012 Nobel Peace Prize|2012 prize]] went to the [[European Union]] for "over six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe". Among other objections, some former laureates disputed the award, claiming that the EU is "clearly not a champion of peace".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/11/30/desmond-tutu-2-other-nobel-peace-prize-laureates-contest-2012-winner-choice-eu/ Desmond Tutu, other Nobel Peace Prize laureates contest 2012 winner choice of EU], Associated Press story (30 November 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010===
The [[2010 Nobel Peace Prize|2010 prize]] went to [[Liu Xiaobo]] "for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China". Liu was imprisoned at the time of the award and neither he nor his family were allowed to attend the ceremony. The Chinese government alleged that Liu did not promote "international friendship, disarmament, and peace meetings", the prize's stated goal.&lt;ref name="The Age: China furious at Nobel's 'violation'"&gt;{{cite news|author=Garnaut, John|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/china-furious-at-nobels-violation-20101008-16c29.html|title=China furious at Nobel's 'violation'|date=9 October 2010|work=The Age |location=Australia|accessdate=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They further alleged that Liu Xiaobo had participated in organizations that received funding from the [[National Endowment for Democracy]], which they claimed brought his status and the prize itself into question.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} The award led to a diplomatic dispute between Norway and China.

Pro-Chinese government and state-controlled media had criticized Liu's selection due to his low profile and obscurity within China and among Chinese youth. Critics such as [[Tariq Ali]], [[Barry Sautman]], and Yan Hairong also criticized Liu's selection for his long support of American involvement in wars in other nations, particularly Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan, and Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/dec/15/nobel-winner-liu-xiaobo-chinese-dissident |location=London |work=The Guardian |author1=Barry Sautman |author2=Yan Hairong |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Do supporters of Nobel winner Liu Xiaobo really know what he stands for? – Barry Sautman and Yan Hairong |date=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/tariq12132010.html |title=Does Liu Xiaobo Really Deserve the Peace Prize?

===2009===
The [[2009 Nobel Peace Prize|2009 prize]] went to [[Barack Obama]] "for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples". The award, given just nine months into Obama's first term as president, received criticism that it was undeserved, premature and politically motivated. Obama himself said that he felt "surprised" by the win and did not consider himself worthy of the award, but nonetheless accepted it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Sharon Otterman|title = World Reaction to a Nobel Surprise|newspaper=The New York Times|date=9 October 2009|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/world-reaction-to-a-nobel-surprise/?hp#bozoanchor|accessdate=9 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-BarackObama/idUKTRE5983AM20091009?virtualBrandChannel=11621&amp;sp=true|title=Obama Peace Prize win has Americans asking why?|agency=Reuters |accessdate=9 October 2009|date=9 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/33237202 Obama: Nobel Peace Prize ‘a call to action’ – Politics – White House –nbcnews.com].

In 2015, [[Geir Lundestad]], director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute (who sat in on the committee's meetings but did not have a vote&lt;ref name=Diebel18Sept/&gt;), wrote in his memoir, ''Secretary of Peace'', that he regretted giving the prize to Obama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34277960|publisher=BBC |title=Nobel secretary regrets Obama peace prize|date=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee "thought it would strengthen Obama and it didn't have this effect", Lundestad told the ''Associated Press'', though he fell short of calling the award a mistake.&lt;ref name=Diebel18Sept/&gt; "In hindsight, we could say that the argument of giving Obama a helping hand was only partially correct," Lundestad wrote.&lt;ref name=Diebel18Sept&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/09/18/former-top-nobel-official-says-maybe-obamas-peace-prize-was-not-such-a-good-idea/72396794/|title=Former Nobel chief: Obama Peace Prize a failure|first=Matthew|last=Diebel|work=USA Today|date=18 September 2015|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also argued that the award was a symbolic rejection of the [[George W.

===2007===
The [[2007 Nobel Peace Prize|2007 prize]] went to [[Al Gore]] and the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]], "for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change". The award received criticism on the grounds of political motivation and because the winners' work was not directly related to ending conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN12207344 |agency=Reuters |title=ANALYSIS-Nobel is sweet revenge for Gore, blow to Bush|author=Matt Spetalnick|date=12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004===
The 2004 prize went to [[Wangari Maathai]] "for her contribution to sustainable development, democracy and peace". Controversially, she was reported by the Kenyan newspaper [[The Standard (Kenya)|Standard]] and [[Radio Free Europe]] to have stated that [[HIV/AIDS]] was originally developed by Western scientists in order to depopulate Africa. She later denied these claims, although the Standard stood by its reporting.&lt;ref&gt;Sindelar, Daisy.

===2002===
The 2002 prize went to [[Jimmy Carter]] for "decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development." The announcement of the award came shortly after the US House and Senate authorized President [[George W. Bush]] to use military force against [[Iraq]] in order to enforce [[UN Security Council]] resolutions requiring that [[Baghdad]] give up [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Asked if the selection of the former president was a criticism of Bush, [[Gunnar Berge]], head of the Nobel Prize committee, said: "With the position Carter has taken on this, it can and must also be seen as criticism of the line the current US administration has taken on Iraq." Carter declined to comment on the remark in interviews, saying that he preferred to focus on the work of the [[Carter Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/10/11/carter.nobel/index.html|publisher=CNN|title=Jimmy Carter wins Nobel Peace Prize|date=11 October 2002|accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000===
The 2000 prize went to [[Kim Dae-jung]] "for his work for democracy and human rights in South Korea and in East Asia in general, and for peace and reconciliation with North Korea in particular". Criticisms argued that Kim made a historical event in North Korea, which was tainted significantly by allegations that at least [[Cash-for-summit scandal|several hundred million dollars]] had been paid to Pyongyang. His Chief of Staff, Park Ji-won, was sentenced to twelve years in prison in 2003 for, among other charges, his role in the Hyundai payment to North Korea for the North–South summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Legal Reform in Korea |last=Ginsburg |first=Tom |year=2004 |publisher=Psychology Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K9vTKe0qdLsC |accessdate=25 June 2012 |isbn=9780203479384 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705044641/http://books.google.com/books?id=K9vTKe0qdLsC |archivedate=5 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in order to persuade North Korea to attend the summit, several "[[unconverted long-term prisoners]]" kept by South Korea were released and returned to North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/koreas/BI05Dg01.html |periodical=[[Asia Times Online]] |title=Spies' repatriation causes unease in Seoul |last=Ahn |first=Mi-young |date=5 September 2000 |accessdate=2010-06-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235340/http://www.atimes.com/koreas/BI05Dg01.html |archivedate=2 December 2013 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1994===
The 1994 prize went to [[Yasser Arafat]], [[Shimon Peres]], and [[Yitzhak Rabin]] "for their efforts to create peace in the Middle East". [[Kåre Kristiansen]], a Norwegian member of the Nobel Committee, resigned in protest at Arafat's award, citing his sponsorship of terrorism through the [[PLO]] and calling him the "world's most prominent terrorist". On the other hand, [[Edward Said]] was critical of Peres and Rabin and the entire [[Oslo Accords]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author = Edward Said |title = Peace and Its Discontents: Essays on Palestine in the Middle East Peace Process|publisher=Vintage|year = 1996|isbn = 0-679-76725-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992===
The 1992 prize went to [[Rigoberta Menchú]] for "her work for social justice and ethno-cultural reconciliation based on respect for the rights of indigenous peoples". The prize was controversial{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} because the prize-winner's memoirs, which had brought her to fame, turned out to be partly fictitious.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/stoll-menchu.html Rigoberta Menchú and the Story of All Poor Guatemalans], [[David Stoll]], [[Westview Press]], 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===1991===
The 1991 prize went to [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], the Leader of the opposition in [[Myanmar|Burma]], "for her non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights"; she was being held under [[house arrest]] by the Burmese military junta at the time. The committee's selection was opposed by the Burmese military junta, which decided not to allow her to attend the awarded ceremony. In 2017 her Nobel prize became a matter of controversy after United Nations' report which said Myanmar's military carried out an act of genocide against Rohingya Muslims, an ethnic minority in Myanmar. Suu Kyi has repeatedly refused to speak out against violence committed by the military against the Rohingya and her silence over the mass killings has been likened by researchers to “legitimising genocide”.

===1990===
The 1990 prize went to [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] "for his leading role in the peace process which today characterizes important parts of the international community". Criticism for this award was due to the fact that the [[Soviet President]] destabilised the [[Eastern bloc]] and caused the economic collapse and fall of the [[Soviet Union]].

===1989===
The 1989 prize went to the [[14th Dalai Lama]]. The committee's selection was opposed by the Chinese government, which opposes the Dalai Lama's activities regarding [[Tibet]]. Additionally, the Nobel Prize Committee cited their intention to put pressure on China, due to the [[Tiananmen Square Massacre]] which happened in June 1989.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===1978===
The 1978 prize went to [[Anwar Sadat]], the [[President of Egypt]] during the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]] against Israel, and [[Menachem Begin]], the [[Prime Minister of Israel]] "for the [[Camp David Accords|Camp David Agreement]], which brought about a negotiated peace between Egypt and Israel". The prize was controversial{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} because both had fought against British rule of their respective countries, and Begin was involved in a failed plot to assassinate German chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]].&lt;ref name="TGUK_Harding_20060615"/&gt;

===1973===
The 1973 prize went to North Vietnamese communist leader [[Lê Đức Thọ]] and [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Henry A. Kissinger]] "for the 1973 [[Paris Peace Accords]] intended to bring about a cease-fire in the [[Vietnam War]] and a withdrawal of the American forces". Thọ later declined the prize, on grounds that such "bourgeois sentimentalities" were not for him&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kissinger's Year: 1973|last=Horne|first=Alistair|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=195|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Paris Peace Accords were not being adhered to in full. Kissinger was also privately skeptical about sharing the prize, saying to Soviet ambassador [[Anatoly Dobrynin|Dobrynin]] "I figure it like [[Groucho Marx]] said 'any club that took him in he would not want to join.' I would say that anything Lê Đức Thọ is eligible for, there must be something wrong with it."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

North Vietnam invaded [[South Vietnam]] in April 1975 and reunified the country whilst Lê Đức Thọ was still in government. Kissinger's history included the secret 1969–1975 bombing campaign against Khmer Rouge and North Vietnamese Army troops in [[Cambodia]], the alleged U.S. complicity in [[Operation Condor]]—a mid-1970s campaign of kidnapping and murder coordinated among the intelligence and security services of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile ([[U.S. intervention in Chile#1973 coup|see details]]), Paraguay, and Uruguay—as well as the death of French nationals under the Chilean junta. He also supported the [[Turkish Intervention in Cyprus]] resulting in the de facto partition of the island.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens, Christopher (26 February 2001). "A Nation Betrayed." London: The Guardian https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/feb/26/extract.features11&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Irwin Abrams]], this prize was the most controversial to date. Two Norwegian Nobel Committee members resigned in protest.&lt;ref name="Abrams219"&gt;{{cite book|author=Irwin Abrams|year=2001|page=219|title=The Nobel Peace Prize and the laureates: an illustrated biographical history, 1901–2001|isbn=0-88135-388-4|authorlink=Irwin Abrams}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feldman16"&gt;{{cite book|author=Burton Feldman|year=2001|page=[https://archive.org/details/nobelprizehistor00feld/page/16 16]|title=The Nobel prize: a history of genius, controversy, and prestige|isbn=1-55970-537-X|authorlink=Burton Feldman|url=https://archive.org/details/nobelprizehistor00feld/page/16|publisher=Arcade Pub.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American press also reacted with consternation to the award: the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] dubbed it the "Nobel War Prize";&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; the [[The Washington Post|Washington Post]] quoted retired diplomat [[George Ball (diplomat)|George Ball]] as saying that on the evidence "The Norwegians must have a sense of humour."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The well-known comedian and political satirist [[Tom Lehrer]] said:  "Political satire became obsolete when Henry Kissinger was awarded the Nobel peace prize."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/jul/31/artsfeatures1|title=When Kissinger won the Nobel peace prize, satire died|first=Todd S.|last=Purdom|date=31 July 2000|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the award was announced, hostilities were continuing.&lt;ref name="Abrams219"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Burton Feldman|year=2001|page=[https://archive.org/details/nobelprizehistor00feld/page/315 315]|title=The Nobel prize: a history of genius, controversy, and prestige|isbn=1-55970-537-X|authorlink=Burton Feldman|url=https://archive.org/details/nobelprizehistor00feld/page/315|publisher=Arcade Pub.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrams315"&gt;{{cite book|author=Irwin Abrams|year=2001|page=315|title=The Nobel Peace Prize and the laureates: an illustrated biographical history, 1901–2001|isbn=0-88135-388-4|authorlink=Irwin Abrams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kissinger did not attend the award ceremony in Oslo over concern that it would be targeted by [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war protest groups]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; He requested that the prize money be donated to a scholarship fund for US servicemen killed or missing in Indochina.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; In 1975, as [[Fall of Saigon|Saigon fell to North Vietnamese forces]] he offered to return the medal, an offer not accepted by the Nobel Committee.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===1945===
The 1945 prize went to [[Cordell Hull]] as "Former Secretary of State; Prominent participant in the originating of the UN". The prize was controversial{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} because Hull was [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] during the ''[[SS St. Louis]]'' Crisis.  ''St. Louis'' sailed from [[Hamburg]] in the summer of 1939 carrying over 950 [[Jewish refugees]], seeking asylum from [[Nazi]] persecution. Initially, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt showed some willingness to take in some of those on board, but Hull and Southern Democrats voiced vehement opposition, and some of them threatened to withhold their support of Roosevelt in the 1940 election. On 4 June 1939 Roosevelt denied entry to the ship, which was waiting in the Florida strait between Florida and Cuba. The passengers began negotiations with the Cuban government, but those broke down. Forced to return to Europe, over a quarter of its passengers subsequently were murdered in the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=szsEtvPJ--cC&amp;pg=PA174 Miller and Ogilvie, pp. 174–175].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, pp. 447, 567 citing Morgan-Witts and Thomas (1994) pp.8, 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|title = Saving the Jews|author = Robert Rosen|date = 17 July 2006|location = [[Carter Center]] (Atlanta, Georgia)|url =http://www.savingthejews.com/html/carterlibraryspeech.htm|accessdate =17 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1939===
In a submission not intended to be taken seriously, antifascist member of the [[Riksdag|Swedish parliament]] [[Erik Gottfrid Christian Brandt]] nominated German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]], but the nomination was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=3243 |title=Nomination Database |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No prize was awarded in 1939 to anyone for peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.warhistoryonline.com/world-war-ii/bitter-joke-adolf-hitler-nominated-nobel-peace-prize-1939-m.html |title=As A Bitter Joke, Adolf Hitler Was Nominated For The Nobel Peace Prize in 1939 |publisher=War History Online |date=17 June 2017 |accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1935===
The prize of 1935 was retroactively awarded one year later to [[Carl von Ossietzky]], a German pacifist who had been convicted of high treason and espionage for exposing [[German re-armament]]. In an unprecedented move, [[King Haakon VII]] of Norway was absent from the award ceremony, two committee members resigned in protest, and the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Norwegian conservative]] press, including leading daily ''[[Aftenposten]]'', condemned giving the award to a convicted criminal. Ossietzky, interned in the [[KZ Esterwegen|concentration camp Esterwegen]] and severely ill with tuberculosis, accepted the award by letter but was prevented from traveling to Oslo. The award led to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s forbidding any German to receive any of the Nobel Prizes in the future, and his prize was not allowed to be mentioned in the German press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1935/ossietzky.html |title=Carl von Ossietzky – Biography |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948 Gandhi received six letters of nomination and was on the short list for the Peace Prize but he was assassinated on 30 January 1948, two days before the closing date for nominations. The Nobel Committee decided against awarding the prize, saying the laureate could only be awarded posthumously if he/she died after the Committee's decision had been made.&lt;ref name="nobelprize.org"&gt;Øyvind Tønnesson (1 December 1999).

;2017

The 2017 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] was awarded to [[Rainer Weiss|Reiner Weiss]], [[Kip Thorne]], and [[Barry Barish]] for their contribution to [[LIGO]], which led to the detection of gravitational waves. Despite the contributions of the upwards of a thousand scientists and engineers in LIGO, the [[Nobel Committee for Physics|Nobel Committee]] continued its tradition of only awarding the prize to three physicists. All three winners commented saying that the prize belongs to the entire [[LIGO Scientific Collaboration|LIGO Collaboration]] ([[LIGO Scientific Collaboration|LSC]]). [[Kip Thorne|Thorne]] said "It is unfortunate that, due to the statutes of the [[Nobel Foundation]], the prize has to go to no more than three people, when our marvelous [[Gravitational wave detection, February 2016|discovery]] is the work of more than a thousand."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/10/03/nobel-prize-in-physics-won-by-rainer-weiss-barry-barish-and-kip-thorne/|title=Three Americans win Nobel Prize in physics for gravitational wave discovery|last=Guarino|first=Ben|date=2017-10-03|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2010
The 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to [[Andre Geim]] and [[Konstantin Novoselov]] of the University of Manchester "for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material [[graphene]]". Several problems with the factual accuracy of the supporting documents issued by the Nobel committee have been pointed out, including that they seem to wrongly attribute the discovery of graphene to Geim and Novoselov, and they didn't take into account other contributions to graphene research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/468486a | volume=468 | title=Nobel document triggers debate | year=2010 | journal=Nature | page=486 | last1 = Samuel Reich | first1 = Eugenie| issue=7323 | pmid=21107397 | bibcode=2010Natur.468..486R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2009
The 2009 prize went to [[Willard Boyle]] and [[George E. Smith]] for developing the [[charge-coupled device]]. However, [[Eugene I. Gordon]] and [[Michael Francis Tompsett]] claimed that it should have been theirs for establishing that the technology could be used for imaging.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/disputes-over-nobel-time-honoured/article1409813/ This page is available to GlobePlus subscribers].

;2008
Half of the 2008 prize went to [[Makoto Kobayashi (physicist)|Makoto Kobayashi]] and [[Toshihide Maskawa]] for their 1972 work on [[quark]] mixing. This postulated the existence of three additional quarks beyond the three then known to exist and used this postulate to provide a possible mechanism for [[CP violation]], which had been observed 8 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060405023917/http://nobelprize.org/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 April 2006 |title=2008 Nobel Prize in Physics – Scientific Background |accessdate=8 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}. nobelprize.org&lt;/ref&gt; Their work expanded and reinterpreted research by the Italian physicist [[Nicola Cabibbo]], dating to 1963, before the quark model was even introduced.

;2006
The 2006 prize was won by [[John C. Mather]] and [[George F. Smoot]] (leaders of the [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] (COBE) satellite experiment) for "discovery of the blackbody form and [[anisotropy]] of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMBR)." However, in July 1983 an experiment&lt;ref&gt;[http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/relikt/ LAMBDA – Relikt Overview]. Lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov.

Brukhanov presented a seminar at [[Sternberg Astronomical Institute]] in Moscow, where he first reported on the discovery.

;2005
Half of the 2005 prize went to [[Roy J. Glauber]] "for his contribution to the quantum theory of optical coherence". This research involved [[E. C. George Sudarshan]]'s relevant 1960 work in [[quantum optics]], which was allegedly slighted in this award.&lt;ref&gt;R.

;1997
The 1997 prize went to [[Steven Chu]], [[Claude Cohen-Tannoudji]] and [[William Daniel Phillips]] "for development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light." The award was disputed by Russian scientists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/1997/10/21/007.html |title=Nobel Prize Challenged By Russians |accessdate=20 November 2006 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127213018/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/1997/10/21/007.html |archivedate=27 January 2007}}, ''The Moscow Times'', 21 October 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; who questioned the awardees' priority in the acquired approach and techniques, which the Russians claimed to have carried out more than a decade before.&lt;ref&gt;Bitte Roth (1997){{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/1997/nobel.prize/stories/americans.sciences/ |title=Americans again dominate in science |accessdate=20 November 2006 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510094755/http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/1997/nobel.prize/stories/americans.sciences/ |archivedate=10 May 2007}}, ''CNN''.&lt;/ref&gt;

;1983
The 1983 prize went to [[William Alfred Fowler]] "for his theoretical and experimental studies of the nuclear reactions of importance in the formation of the chemical elements in the universe". Fowler acknowledged [[Fred Hoyle]] as the pioneer of the concept of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] but that was not enough for Hoyle to receive a share. Hoyle's obituary in ''[[Physics Today]]'' notes that "Many of us felt that Hoyle should have shared Fowler's 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics, but the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences later made partial amends by awarding Hoyle, with Edwin Salpeter, its 1997 [[Crafoord Prize]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=In Brief|journal=Physics Today|volume=54|page=75|year=2001|doi=10.1063/1.1428444|issue=11|bibcode = 2001PhT....54k..75.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;1979
The 1979 prize went to [[Sheldon Glashow]], [[Abdus Salam]] and [[Steven Weinberg]] for the [[electroweak interaction]] unification theory. However, [[E. C. George Sudarshan]] and [[Robert Marshak]] were the first proponents of the successful V-A (vector minus axial vector, or left-handed) theory for weak interactions in 1957. It was essentially the same theory as that proposed by [[Richard Feynman]] and [[Murray Gell-Mann]] in their "mathematical physics" paper on the structure of the [[weak interaction]]. Actually, Gell-Mann had been let in on the Sudarshan/Marshak work on Sudarshan's initiative,&lt;ref name="Rothman"/&gt; but no acknowledgment appeared in the later paper, except for an informal allusion. The reason given was that the originators' work had not been published in a formal or 'reputable enough' science journal at the time. The theory is popularly known in the west as the Feynman-Gell-Mann theory.&lt;ref name="V-A"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090207164536/http://www.ph.utexas.edu/fogs/sudarshan_vminusa.html Sudarshan: Seven Science Quests]. ph.utexas.edu.&lt;/ref&gt; The V-A theory for weak interactions was, in effect, a new Law of Nature. It was conceived in the face of a series of apparently contradictory experimental results, including several from [[Chien-Shiung Wu]]. It was also aided along by a sprinkling of other evidence, like the [[muon]]. Discovered in 1936, the muon had a curious and colorful history&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.g-2.bnl.gov/ The E821 Muon (g-2) Home Page]".&lt;/ref&gt; all to itself and would itself lead on to a new revolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~hrs/icap2002/proceedings/Morse.pdf|author=William Morse|title=The Expanding Frontier of Atomic Physics|pages=252–259|arxiv=hep-ex/0308064|bibcode = 2003efap.conf..252M |doi = 10.1142/9789812705099_0026 |display-authors=etal|chapter=Precision Measurement of the Anomalous Magnetic Moment of the Muon|year=2003|isbn=978-981-238-228-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.interactions.org/cms/?pid=1009159 New g-2 Measurement Deviates Further From Standard Model]".&lt;/ref&gt; This breakthrough has to date not yet won a Nobel Prize award. The V-A theory would form the foundation for the [[electroweak interaction]] theory later on. Sudarshan regarded the V-A theory as his finest work. The Sudarshan-Marshak (or V-A theory) – preferably and favourably assessed as "beautiful" by [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]],&lt;ref name="Rothman"&gt;[[Tony Rothman]] (2003) ''Everything's Relative and Other Fables from Science and Technology'', Wiley, {{ISBN|0471202576}}.&lt;/ref&gt; – was only to be disparaged later on as "less complete" and "inelegant" by [[John Gribbin]].&lt;ref name="Gribbin"&gt;Mary Gribbin and [[John Gribbin]] (1997) ''A Life in Science: Richard Feynman'', Dutton Adult, {{ISBN|052594124X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

;1978
The 1978 prize was awarded for the chanced "detection of [[Cosmic microwave background radiation]]". The joint winners, [[Arno Allan Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]], had their discovery elucidated by others. Many scientists felt that [[Ralph Alpher]], who predicted the cosmic microwave background radiation and in 1948 worked out the underpinnings of the [[Big Bang theory]], should have shared in the prize or received one independently. In 2005, Alpher received the [[National Medal of Science]] for his pioneering contributions to understanding of [[nucleosynthesis]], the prediction of the relic radiation from the Big Bang, as well as for a model for the Big Bang.

;1974
The 1974 prize went to [[Martin Ryle]] and [[Antony Hewish]] "for their pioneering research in radio astrophysics: Ryle for his observations and inventions, in particular of the [[aperture synthesis]] technique, and Hewish for his decisive role in the discovery of [[pulsar]]s". Hewish was not the first to correctly explain pulsars, initially describing them as communications from "Little Green Men" ([[LGM-1]]) in outer space. David Staelin and Edward Reifenstein, of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, found a pulsar at the centre of the [[Crab Nebula]]. The notion that pulsars were [[neutron star]]s, leftovers from a [[supernova]] explosion, had been proposed in 1933. Soon after their 1967 discovery, [[Fred Hoyle]] and astronomer [[Thomas Gold]] correctly explained it as a rapidly spinning neutron star with a strong magnetic field, emitting radio waves. [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]], Hewish's graduate student, was not recognized, although she was the first to notice the stellar radio source that was later recognized as a pulsar.&lt;ref name="Sharon"&gt;Sharon Bertsch McGrayne (1998) ''Nobel Prize Women in Science: Their Lives, Struggles and Momentous Discoveries'', Carol Pub. Group, {{ISBN|0806520256}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While Hoyle argued that Bell should have been included in the prize, Bell said, "I believe it would demean Nobel Prizes if they were awarded to research students, except in very exceptional cases, and I do not believe this is one of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigear.org/CSMO/HTML/CS01/cs01p16.htm |title=Cosmic Search Issue 01 Page 16 – S.

;1969
The 1969 prize was won by [[Murray Gell-Mann]] "for his contributions and discoveries concerning the classification of elementary particles and their interactions" (postulating the existence of [[quark]]s). [[George Zweig]], then a PhD student at [[Caltech]], independently espoused the physical existence of ''aces'', essentially the same thing. Unfortunately, Zweig did not publish his results in a peer-reviewed journal, although his work was widely available as a CERN preprint.&lt;ref&gt;G. Zweig, "An SU3 Model for Strong Interaction Symmetry and its Breaking," CERN Report 8182/Th. 401, unpublished (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://cerncourier.com/main/article/45/2/2⅔ Faces and places (page 3)]", ''Cern Courier'', Page 3 of 8.

;1956
The 1956 prize went to [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Houser Brattain]] and [[William Bradford Shockley]] "for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect". However, the committee did not recognize numerous preceding patent applications. As early as 1928, [[Julius Edgar Lilienfeld]] patented several modern [[transistor]] types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/~eugeniik/history/lilienfeld.htm |title=Julius Edgar Lilienfeld |accessdate=1 March 2006 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002065548/http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/~eugeniik/history/lilienfeld.htm |archivedate=2 October 2006}}.

Further, [[Herbert Mataré]] and [[Heinrich Welker]], at [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] Paris, applied for a patent in 1948 of an [[amplifier]] based on the minority carrier injection process. Mataré had first observed transconductance effects during the manufacture of [[germanium]] diodes for German radar equipment during World War II. Shockley was part of other controversies&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/transistor/album1/addlbios/egos.html Shockley, Brattain and Bardeen]. pbs.org (ca. 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;—including his position as a corporate director and his self-promotion efforts.&lt;ref name=kessler&gt;Ronald Kessler (6 April 1997) "[http://www1.hollins.edu/faculty/richter/327/AbsentCreation.htm Absent at the Creation; How one scientist made off with the biggest invention since the light bulb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224230527/http://www1.hollins.edu/faculty/richter/327/AbsentCreation.htm |date=24 February 2015 }}", The Washington Post Magazine, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the original design Shockley presented to Brattain and Bardeen did not work.

;1950
The 1950 prize went to [[Cecil Powell]] for "his development of the photographic method of studying nuclear processes and his discoveries regarding [[meson]]s made with this method". However, Brazilian physicist [[César Lattes]] was the main researcher and the first author of the historical ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' journal article describing the [[subatomic particle]] [[meson]] pi ([[pion]]). Lattes was solely responsible for the improvement of the nuclear emulsion used by Powell (by asking [[Kodak]] Co. to add more [[boron]] to it—and in 1947, he made with them his great experimental discovery). This result was explained by the Nobel Committee policy (ended in 1960) to award the prize to the research group head only. Lattes calculated the pion's mass and, with USA physicist Eugene Gardner, demonstrated the existence of this particle after atomic collisions in a [[synchrotron]]. Gardner was denied a prize because he died soon thereafter.

;1938
The 1938 prize went to [[Enrico Fermi]] in part for "his demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation". However, in this case, the award later appeared to be premature: Fermi thought he had created [[transuranic element]]s (specifically, [[hesperium]]), but had in fact unwittingly demonstrated [[nuclear fission]] (and had actually created only [[fission products]]—isotopes of much lighter elements than uranium). The fact that Fermi's interpretation was incorrect was discovered shortly after he had received his prize.

;1936
The 1936 prize went to [[Carl D. Anderson]] for the discovery of the positron. While a graduate student at Caltech in 1930, [[Chung-Yao Chao]] was the first to experimentally identify [[positron]]s through [[electron–positron annihilation]], but did not realize what they were. Anderson, Chao's classmate at Caltech, used the same [[radioactive]] source, [[Thallium-208|{{chem|208|Tl}}]], as Chao. (Historically, {{chem|208|Tl}} was known as "thorium C double prime" or "ThC", see [[decay chain]]s.) Fifty years later, Anderson admitted that Chao had inspired his discovery: Chao's research formed the foundation from which much of Anderson's own work developed. Chao died in 1998, without sharing in a Nobel Prize acknowledgment.&lt;ref name="Cao"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cao|first=Cong|date=2004|title=Chinese Science and the 'Nobel Prize Complex'|url=http://china-us.uoregon.edu/pdf/Minerva-2004.pdf|journal=Minerva|language=en|volume=42|issue=2|pages=151–172|doi=10.1023/b:mine.0000030020.28625.7e|issn=0026-4695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;1923
The 1923 prize went to [[Robert Millikan]] "for his work on the elementary charge of electricity and on the [[photoelectric effect]]". Millikan might have won in 1920 but for [[Felix Ehrenhaft]]'s incorrect claim to have measured a smaller charge. Some controversy, however, still seems to linger over Millikan's oil-drop procedure and experimental interpretation, over whether Millikan manipulated his data in the 1913 scientific paper measuring the electron charge. Allegedly, he did not report all his observations.&lt;ref&gt;"Subelectrons, Presuppositions, and the Millikan-Ehrenhaft Dispute" by G. Holton, ''Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences'', 1978, vol 9, pp.&amp;nbsp;166–224.&lt;/ref&gt;

;1903
The 1903 prize went to [[Henri Becquerel]] (along with [[Pierre Curie|Pierre]] and [[Marie Curie]]) "in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by his discovery of spontaneous [[radioactivity]]". However, critics alleged that Becquerel merely rediscovered a phenomenon first noticed and investigated decades earlier by the French scientist [[Abel Niepce de Saint-Victor]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~trothman/niepce.html Invisible Light: The Discovery of Radioactivity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205072006/http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~trothman/niepce.html |date=5 February 2012 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;

;Other major unrecognized discoveries
None of the contributors to the discovery of [[nuclear fission]] won the prize for Physics. Instead, the prize for Chemistry was awarded to [[Otto Hahn]] for his discovery of fission in Berlin in 1938. [[Lise Meitner]] also contributed to the discovery of nuclear fission,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/reviews/lisemeitner.htm Bartusiak, Marcia.

;Bose–Einstein statistics
Several Nobel Prizes were awarded for research related to the concepts of the [[boson]], [[Bose–Einstein statistics]] and [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]—the latest being the 2001 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] given for advancing the theory of Bose–Einstein condensates although [[Satyendra Nath Bose]] himself was not awarded the Nobel Prize.  In his book ''The Scientific Edge'', physicist [[Jayant Narlikar]] observed: "SN Bose's work on particle statistics (c.1922), which clarified the behavior of [[photon]]s (the particles of light in an enclosure) and opened the door to new ideas on statistics of Microsystems that obey the rules of quantum theory, was one of the top ten achievements of 20th century Indian science and could be considered in the Nobel Prize class."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author = Jayant V Narlikar |year = 2003 |title = The Scientific Edge: The Indian Scientist from Vedic to Modern Times |publisher = Penguin Books |isbn = 978-0-14-303028-7 |page = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of other 20th century Indian scientists which Narlikar considered to be of Nobel Prize class were [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]], [[Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman]] and [[Meghnad Saha]].

;Einstein's annus mirabilis
[[File:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|thumb|[[Albert Einstein]], awarded a single 1921 Prize out of numerous nominations.]]
[[Albert Einstein]]'s 1921 Nobel Prize Award mainly recognized his 1905 discovery of the mechanism of the [[photoelectric effect]] and "for his services to Theoretical Physics". The Nobel committee passed on several nominations for his many other seminal contributions, although these led to prizes for others who later applied more advanced technology to experimentally verify his work, most notably the 2017 prize awarded to the heads of [[LIGO]]. Many predictions of Einstein's theories have been verified as technology advances. Recent examples include the bending of light in a [[gravitational field]], [[gravitational wave]]s (detected by [[LIGO]]), [[gravitational lens]]ing and [[black hole]]s. It wasn't until 1993 that the first evidence for the existence of gravitational radiation came via the Nobel Prize-winning measurements of the [[Hulse–Taylor binary]] system.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/09/060914094623.htm General Relativity Survives Gruelling Pulsar Test: Einstein At Least 99.95 Percent Right]", Particle Physics &amp; Astronomy Research Council, 14 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee also failed to recognize the other contributions of his [[Annus Mirabilis papers]] on [[Brownian motion]] and [[special relativity]]. Often these nominations for Special Relativity were for both [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and Einstein. [[Henri Poincaré]] was also nominated at least once for his work, including on Lorentz's relativity theory. However, [[Walter Kaufmann (physicist)|Kaufmann's]] then-experimental results (incorrectly) cast doubt on Special Relativity. These doubts were not resolved until 1915. By this time, Einstein had progressed to his [[general theory of relativity]], including his theory of gravitation. Empirical support—in this case the predicted spectral shift of sunlight—was in question for many decades. The only piece of original evidence was the consistency with the known [[perihelion]] precession of the planet Mercury. Some additional support was gained at the end of 1919, when the predicted deflection of starlight near the sun was confirmed by [[Arthur Eddington]]'s Solar Eclipse Expedition, though here again the actual results were somewhat ambiguous. Conclusive proof of the gravitational light deflection prediction was not achieved until the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The 2011 prize was awarded in part to [[Ralph Steinman]], who died of cancer days before the award, a fact unknown to the Nobel committee at the time of the award. Committee rules prohibit posthumous awards, and Steinman's death created a dilemma unprecedented in the history of the award. The committee ruled that Steinman remained eligible for the award despite his death, under the rule that allows awardees to receive the award who die between being named and the awards ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Stefanie Ilgenfritz (3 October 2011) [https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2011/10/03/a-posthumous-nobel-for-medicine/ A Posthumous Nobel for Medicine?] ''Wall Street Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 prize was awarded in part to [[Harald zur Hausen]] "for his discovery of [[human papilloma virus]]es (HPV) causing [[cervical cancer]]". The Swedish police anticorruption unit investigated charges of improper influence by [[AstraZeneca]], which had a stake in two lucrative HPV [[vaccine]]s.

The other half of the 2008 prize was split between [[Luc Montagnier]] and [[Françoise Barré-Sinoussi]] "for their discovery of human immunodeficiency virus". The omission of [[Robert Gallo]] was controversial: 106 scientists signed a letter to the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' stating that 'While these awardees fully deserve the award, it is equally important to recognize the contributions of Robert C.

Matthaei]] broke the [[genetic code]] in 1961 with Nirenberg in their [[Nirenberg and Matthaei experiment|poly-U experiment]] at [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, paving the way for modern [[genetics]]. Matthaei was responsible for experimentally obtaining the first [[codon]] ([[nucleotide]] triple that usually specifies an [[amino acid]]) extract, while Nirenberg tampered with his initial, accurate results (due to his belief in 'less precise', 'more believable' data presentation).&lt;ref name="Judson"&gt;{{Citation

The 1962 prize was awarded to [[James Watson]], [[Francis Crick]] and [[Maurice Wilkins]] "for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material". It did not recognize critical contributions from [[Alec Stokes]], [[Herbert Wilson]], and [[Erwin Chargaff]]. In addition, Chargaff, [[Oswald Avery]] and [[Rosalind Franklin]] (whose key [[DNA]] [[X-ray crystallography]] work was the most detailed yet least acknowledged among the three) contributed directly to Watson and Crick's insight to solve the DNA molecule's structure. Avery's death in 1955, and Franklin's in 1958, eliminated them from eligibility.

The 1949 prize was awarded to Portuguese neurologist [[António Egas Moniz]] "for his discovery of the therapeutic value of leucotomy ([[prefrontal leucotomy|lobotomy]]) in certain psychoses". Soon after, Dr. [[Walter Freeman (surgeon)|Walter Freeman]] developed the [[transorbital lobotomy]], which was easier to carry out. Criticism was raised because the procedure was often prescribed injudiciously and without regard for [[medical ethics]]. Popular acceptance of the procedure had been fostered by enthusiastic press coverage such as a 1938 ''[[New York Times]]'' report. Endorsed by such influential publications as ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'', in the three years following the Prize, some 5,000 lobotomies were performed in the United States alone, and many more throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Feldman286-289"&gt;{{cite book|author=Burton Feldman|year=2001|pages=[https://archive.org/details/nobelprizehistor00feld/page/286 286–289]|title=The Nobel prize: a history of genius, controversy, and prestige|isbn=1-55970-537-X|authorlink=Burton Feldman|url=https://archive.org/details/nobelprizehistor00feld/page/286|publisher=Arcade Pub.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Elizabeth Day|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/jan/13/neuroscience.medicalscience |title=He was bad, so they put an ice pick in his brain...|work=The Observer |location=UK |date= 13 January 2008|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Kennedy]], father of U.S. President [[John F.

Fleming accidentally stumbled upon the then-unidentified [[fungus|fungal]] [[Mold (fungus)|mold]].

;1926
In 1926, no prize was awarded because the works of the two nominees [[Johannes Andreas Grib Fibiger]] and [[Katsusaburo Yamagiwa]] were considered undeserving. Fibiger had demonstrated that he could induce stomach cancer in rats using a roundworm ''[[Gongylonema neoplasticum]]'' that he discovered (but which he preferred to call ''Spiroptera carcinoma''). Yamagiwa followed suit and induced cancer in rabbit by applying coal tar on the rabbit's ears. Theirs were the first experimental induction of cancer.&lt;ref name="Lalchhandama"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lalchhandama|first1=K.|title=The making of oncology: The tales of false carcinogenic worms|journal=Science Vision|date=2017|volume=17|issue=1|pages=33–52|url=http://www.sciencevision.org/current_issue/dl/Lalchhandama%20Sci%20Vis%2017,%2033-52%20(2017).pdf|doi=10.33493/scivis.17.01.06|access-date=3 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424002410/http://www.sciencevision.org/current_issue/dl/Lalchhandama%20Sci%20Vis%2017,%2033-52%20(2017).pdf|archive-date=24 April 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the assessors Hilding Bergstrand concluded that "one cannot, at this point, find much support for the possibility that the work of Fibiger and Yamagiwa will have great importance in the solving of the riddle of cancer.

;1923
The 1923 prize was awarded to [[Frederick Banting]] and [[John James Rickard Macleod|John Macleod]] "for the discovery of [[insulin]]". Banting clearly deserved the prize, however, the choice of Macleod as co-winner was controversial. Banting felt that [[Charles Herbert Best|Charles Best]] was the proper corecipient, while Macleod had merely given them lab space at the [[University of Toronto]] while Macleod was away for the summer. However, on his return, Macleod pointed out some flaws in their experimental design and gave them advice about directions to work in. Banting's original method of isolating insulin required performing surgery on living dogs, which was too labor-intensive to produce insulin on a large scale. Best then set about finding a biochemical extraction method, while [[James Bertram Collip]], a chemistry professor on sabbatical from the [[University of Alberta]], joined Macleod's team and worked in parallel with Best. The two of them succeeded within days of each other. When Banting agreed to receive the prize, he decided to give half of his prize money to Best. Macleod, in turn, split his half of the prize money with Collip.&lt;ref name="bliss1982"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bliss|first1=Michael|title=The Discovery of Insulin|date=1982|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226058972|url=https://archive.org/details/discoveryofinsul00blis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Toronto team had isolated insulin from the pancreas, many researchers who had worked with pancreatic extracts claimed to have discovered insulin before the Prize winners. These included [[George Ludwig Zuelzer]] (1906), E. L. Scott (1911), and [[Nicolae Paulescu]] (1921).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Paulesco |first= N.C.|journal= Archives Internationales de Physiologie |title= Recherche sur le rôle du pancréas dans l'assimilation nutritive|volume= 17|pages= 85–103|date=31 August 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=C.

In all of the earlier work, the injection of insufficiently pure pancreatic extracts resulted in fever and other side effects. The same problem had affected the Canadians' early tests on humans, but they continued their work until they reached a purity that was acceptable for use in humans.&lt;ref name="bliss1982"/&gt;

{{further|Carlos Chagas#Nobel Prize controversy}}
No prize was awarded in 1921. [[Carlos Chagas]], who had already been nominated in 1913 and was the recipient of several international awards at the time, was among the nominees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nobel Nomination Database |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=1702 |access-date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His failure in receiving the award has generated controversy, especially in his homeland, [[Brazil]]. Chagas alone discovered a new [[infectious disease]] ([[Chagas disease]]) and its [[pathogen]], [[vector (epidemiology)|vector]], [[Host (biology)|host]], clinical manifestation, and [[epidemology]]. According to historian Sierra Iglesias,&lt;ref&gt;Salvador Mazza – su vida y su obra – redescobridor de la enfermedad de Chagas. J. P. Sierra-Iglesias. 1990. San Salvador de Jujuy, Universidad Nacional de Jujuy, 527 p&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet|Nobel Assembly]] retrieved for Brazilian health authorities' advice as to Chagas's being worthy the award and received unfavourable answers. It is known that Chagas had several adversaries inside Brazilian governmental health organizations, mainly due to intellectual rivalries;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=O Nobel perdido|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/ciencia/fe07029901.htm|first=Marília | last=Coutinho |date=7 February 1999 |access-date= 17 September 2016 | newspaper=Folha de S. Paulo | language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Iglesias offers no proof to her claims. It seems substantially more likely that Chagas's not receiving the award was due to the Nobel Committee inability in recognizing the value of Chagas's findings.

[[Camillo Golgi]] and [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] were jointly awarded "in recognition of their work on the structure of the nervous system". However, their interpretation of discoveries were directly in opposition. Much as Golgi made significant contributions to the techniques in the study of nervous system in terms of actual structure, he made a completely erroneous conclusion that nervous system is nothing but a single continuous network, the notion called [[reticular theory]]. On the other hand, Ramón y Cajal described nervous system as composed of interlinking nerve cells or [[neuron]]s as suggested by a theory called the [[neuron doctrine]]. Golgi strongly advocated the reticular theory such that even his Nobel lecture was a direct attack on Cajal's work and the neuron doctrine, and even depicted a diagram of continuous network which he claimed was "an exact reproduction after life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Golgi|first1=Camillo|title=The Neuron Doctrine – Theory and Facts|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1906/golgi-lecture.pdf|publisher=Nobel Media AB|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raviola|first1=Elio|last2=Mazzarello|first2=Paolo|title=The diffuse nervous network of Camillo Golgi: Facts and fiction|journal=Brain Research Reviews|year=2011|volume=66|issue=1–2|pages=75–82|doi=10.1016/j.brainresrev.2010.09.005|pmid=20840856}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bock|first1=Ortwin|title=Cajal, Golgi, Nansen, Schäfer and the Neuron Doctrine|journal=Endeavour|year=2013|volume=37|issue=4|pages=228–234|doi=10.1016/j.endeavour.2013.06.006|pmid=23870749}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, recognising a work on wrong conclusion is inappropriate.

[[Ronald Ross]] was awarded basically for his discovery of the [[Plasmodium|life cycle of malarial parasite]] (as the citation goes: ''for his work on malaria, by which he has shown how it enters the organism...''). In 1897, independent of Ross, [[Giovanni Battista Grassi]], along with his Italian associates, had established the developmental stages of malaria parasites in anopheline mosquitoes; and they described the complete life cycles of ''P. falciparum'', ''P. vivax'' and ''P. malariae'' the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Baccetti B|year=2008 |title=History of the early dipteran systematics in Italy: from Lyncei to Battista Grassi|url= |journal=Parassitologia |volume=50|issue=3–4|pages=167–172 |pmid= 20055226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cox |first1=Francis E.G. |year=2010 |title=History of the discovery of the malaria parasites and their vectors|journal=Parasites &amp; Vectors |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=5 |doi=10.1186/1756-3305-3-5 |pmid=20205846 |pmc=2825508}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial opinion of the [[Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Committee]] was that the prize should be shared between Ross and Grassi. Then Ross made a defamatory campaign accusing Grassi of deliberate fraud. The weight of favour ultimately fell on Ross, largely upon the influences of [[Robert Koch]], the appointed "neutral arbitrator" in the committee; as reported, "Koch threw the full weight of his considerable authority in insisting that Grassi did not deserve the honor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Esch GW|title=Parasites and Infectious Disease: Discovery by Serendipity and Otherwise|year= 2007|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=88RH-7br9OAC&amp;dq|pages= 137–138|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn= 9781139464109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indelible irony was that Ross was definitely the first to show that malarial parasite was transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes, in his case the avian ''[[Plasmodium relictum]]''. But Grassi's work was much more directly relevant to human health as he demonstrated that human malarial parasites were infected only by female ''Anopheles'' (Ross never identified the mosquito species, being not a zoologist, "grey mosquito with dappled wings" was all that he could offer). Grassi identified the species correctly, and in 1898 who first established the complete life cycle of ''P. falciparum'', the first human malarial parasite for which the entire cycle was determined. By today's standard, they should have undoubtedly shared the Nobel.&lt;ref name=coo&gt;{{cite book|author= Cook G|title=Tropical Medicine: An Illustrated History of The Pioneers|year= 2007|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iB_ibIXxhOMC&amp;dq|pages= 93–97|publisher=Academic Press|isbn= 9780080559391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Capanna E|year=2012 |title=Grassi versus Ross: who solved the riddle of malaria?|url= http://revistes.iec.cat/index.php/IM/article/viewFile/4c457c86cb18b.002/9548 |journal=International Microbiology|volume=9|issue=1|pages=69–74|pmid= 16636993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oswald Theodore Avery]], best known for his [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment|1944 demonstration]] that [[DNA]] is the cause of [[bacterial transformation]] and potentially the material of which [[genes]] are composed, never received a Nobel Prize, although two Nobel Laureates, [[Joshua Lederberg]] and [[Arne Tiselius]], praised him and his work as a pioneering platform for further genetic research. According to [[John M. Barry]], in his book ''[[The Great Influenza]]'', the committee was preparing to award Avery, but declined to do so after the DNA findings were published, fearing that they would be endorsing findings that had not yet survived significant scrutiny.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Laureates who declined the prize==

===Forced refusals===
====Forced refusals under Nazi Germany====
In 1936, the Nobel Foundation offended [[Adolf Hitler]] when it awarded the 1935 Nobel Peace Prize to [[Carl von Ossietzky]], a German writer who publicly opposed Hitler and [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name="Nobel-1972_562"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schück|Sohlman|Österling|Bernhard|1972|pp=562–566}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The prize was awarded the following year.) Hitler reacted by issuing a decree on 31 January 1937 that forbade German nationals to accept any Nobel Prize. Awarding the peace prize to Ossietzky was itself considered controversial. While Fascism had few supporters outside Italy, Spain, and Germany, those who did not necessarily sympathize felt that it was wrong to (deliberately) offend Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Henrik Schück|author-link = Henrik Schück|title = Nobel: The Man and His Prizes|place = Stockholm, Sweden|publisher = [[Nobel Foundation]]|year = 1950|isbn = 0-444-00117-4|display-authors = etal|url = https://archive.org/details/nobelmanhisprize0000nobe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Henrik Schück|author-link = Henrik Schück|editor-last = Nobel Foundation|editor-link = Nobel Foundation|title = Nobel: The Man and His Prizes|place = New York|publisher = [[Elsevier]]|year = 1972|edition = 3rd|isbn = 0-444-00117-4|display-authors = etal|url = https://archive.org/details/nobelmanhisprize0000nobe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler's decree prevented three Germans from accepting their prizes: [[Gerhard Domagk]] (1939 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine), [[Richard Kuhn]] (1938 Nobel Prize in Chemistry), and [[Adolf Butenandt]] (1939 Nobel Prize in Chemistry). The three later received their certificates and medals, but not the prize money.&lt;ref name="Nobel Laureates Facts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060405023917/http://nobelprize.org/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 April 2006 |title=Nobel Laureates Facts |accessdate=15 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}. nobelprize.org&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 October 1939, about a month and a half after World War II had started, the Nobel Committee of the [[Karolinska Institutet]] met to discuss the 1939 prize in physiology or medicine.&lt;ref name="Nobel-1972_156"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schück|Sohlman|Österling|Bernhard|1972|pp=156–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority favoured Domagk and someone leaked the news, which traveled to Berlin. The Ministry of Culture in Berlin replied with a telegram stating that a Nobel Prize to a German was "completely unwanted" (''durchaus unerwünscht'').&lt;ref name="Nobel-1972_157"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schück|Sohlman|Österling|Bernhard|1972|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the telegram, a large majority voted for Domagk on 26 October 1939.&lt;ref name="Nobel-1950_174"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schück|Sohlman|Österling|Liljestrand|1950|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once he learned of the decision, hopeful that it only applied to the peace prize, Domagk sent a request to the Ministry of Education in Berlin asking permission to accept the prize.&lt;ref name="Nobel-1950_174-175"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schück|Sohlman|Österling|Liljestrand|1950|pp=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since he did not receive a reply after more than a week had passed, Domagk felt it would be impolite to wait any longer without responding, and on 3 November 1939 he wrote a letter to the Institute thanking them for the distinction, but added that he had to wait for the government's approval before he could accept the prize.&lt;ref name="Nobel-1950_172"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schück|Sohlman|Österling|Liljestrand|1950|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domagk was subsequently ordered to send a copy of his letter to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Berlin, and on 17 November 1939, was arrested by the [[Gestapo]].&lt;ref name="Nobel-1950_173"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schück|Sohlman|Österling|Liljestrand|1950|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hager-251"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hager|2006|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released after one week, then arrested again. On 28 November 1939, he was forced by the  Ministry of Culture to sign a prepared letter, addressed to the Institute, declining the prize.&lt;ref name="Nobel-1950_172"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan_119-120"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryan|1993|pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Institute had already prepared his medal and diploma before the second letter arrived, they were able to award them to him later, during the 1947 Nobel festival. Domagk was the first to decline a prize. Due to his refusal, the procedures changed so that if a laureate declined the prize or failed to collect the prize award before 1 October of the following year, the money would not be awarded.&lt;ref name="Nobel-1972_158"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schück|Sohlman|Österling|Bernhard|1972|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 November 1939, the [[Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences]] awarded the 1938 Prize for Chemistry to Kuhn and half of the 1939 prize to Butenandt.&lt;ref name="Nobel-1950_174"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nobel-1972_369"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schück|Sohlman|Österling|Bernhard|1972|p=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; When notified of the decision, the German scientists were forced to decline by threats of violence.&lt;ref name="Nobel-1972_369"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nobel-1950_388"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schück|Sohlman|Österling|Bernhard|1972|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their refusal letters arrived in Stockholm after Domagk's refusal letter, helping to confirm suspicions that the German government had forced them to refuse the prize.&lt;ref name="Nobel-1950_173"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nobel-1972_369"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nobel-1950_388"/&gt; In 1948, they wrote to the Academy expressing their gratitude for the prizes and their regret for being forced to refuse them in 1939. They were awarded their medals and diplomas at a ceremony in July 1949.

====Other forced refusals====
[[Boris Pasternak]] at first accepted the 1958 Nobel Prize in Literature, but was forced by Soviet authorities to decline, because the prize was considered a "reward for the dissident political innuendo in his novel, ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]''."&lt;ref name="Nobel Laureates Facts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bishop-invol"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bishop|2003|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasternak died without ever receiving the prize. He was eventually honoured by the Nobel Foundation at a banquet in Stockholm on 9 December 1989, when they presented his medal to his son.

The 2010 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to [[Liu Xiaobo]] while he was serving a prison sentence for "subversion of the state", with the Chinese government not allowing him or his family members to attend the ceremony.

===Voluntary refusals===
Two laureates voluntarily declined the Nobel Prize. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] declined the 1964 prize for Literature, stating, "A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honourable form."&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite news|author = Jason English|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/wayoflife/10/06/mf.nobel.odd.facts/index.html|title = Odd facts about Nobel Prize winners|publisher=CNN|date = 6 October 2009|accessdate =21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Jim Holt|url = http://www.slate.com/id/2088648/|title = Exit, Pursued by a Lobster|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date = 22 September 2003|accessdate =21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second person who refused the prize is [[Lê Đức Thọ]], who was awarded the 1973 Peace Prize for his role in the [[Paris Peace Accords]]. He declined, saying there was no actual peace in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; The war resumed four months after he was declared the winner.

==Nobel rumours==

1915 saw a newspaper rumor&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Saari, Stephen Allison, Marie C. Ellavich (1996) ''Scientists: P-Z'', p. 895, {{ISBN|0787609625}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (starting with a 6 November [[Reuters]] report from London) along the lines that [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] was to be awarded to both [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Nikola Tesla]]. The story had gone to press in many publications before a 15 November Reuters story from Stockholm with the announcement that the prize that year was being awarded to [[William Henry Bragg]] and [[William Lawrence Bragg]] "for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1915|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1915/|publisher=nobelprize.org|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google245"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8b-Dp_2KmJoC&amp;pg=PA245 |title=Margaret Cheney, Tesla: Man Out of Time|page= 245 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year= 2001|isbn=9780743215367}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Cheney, Robert Uth, Jim Glenn (1999) ''Tesla, master of lightning'', Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing, p. 120, {{ISBN|0760710058}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There were unsubstantiated rumors at the time that Tesla and Edison had won the prize and that the Nobel committee had changed recipients when Tesla and/or Edison refused the award (a claim also made many years later attributed Tesla).&lt;ref name="Margaret Cheney page 245"&gt;Margaret Cheney (2001) ''[[Tesla: Man Out of Time]]'', p. 245 [https://archive.org/details/TeslaManOutOfTime], Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|0743215362}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nobel Foundation declined to comment on the rumours other than saying, "Any rumor that a person has not been given a Nobel Prize because he has made known his intention to refuse the reward is ridiculous", further stating a recipient could only decline a Nobel Prize after he is announced a winner.&lt;ref name="Margaret Cheney page 245"/&gt;

[[Otto Heinrich Warburg]], a German national who won the 1931 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine, was rumored to have been selected for the 1944 prize but forbidden to accept it. According to the Nobel Foundation, this story is not true.&lt;ref name="Nobel-1972_210"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schück|Sohlman|Österling|Bernhard|1972|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other prizes==
{{Main|List of prizes known as the Nobel of a field}}

===Prizes in non-Nobel domains===
Multiple primary fields of human intellectual endeavor—such as [[mathematics]], philosophy and [[social studies]]—were not included among the Nobel Prizes, because they were not part of Alfred Nobel's will. When [[Jakob von Uexkull]] approached the Nobel Foundation with a proposal to establish two new awards for the environment and for the lives of the poor, he was turned down. He then established the [[Right Livelihood Award]].

In 2003 purportedly a new Nobel-equivalent Award was also created especially for mathematics, the [[Abel Prize]], though the older [[Fields Medal]] is often considered as the mathematical Nobel equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/science/13prof.html|title = Journeys to the Distant Fields of Prime|author=Kenneth Chang|work=The New York Times|date = 12 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Nobel Committee did allow the creation of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics. Many people have opposed this expansion, including the Swedish human rights lawyer Peter Nobel, a great-grandnephew of Alfred Nobel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nobel descendant slams Economics prize |url=http://www.thelocal.se/2173/20050928/ |work=[[The Local]] |date=28 September 2005 |accessdate=31 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech at the 1974 Nobel banquet, awardee [[Friedrich Hayek]] stated that had he been consulted whether to establish an economics prize, he would "have decidedly advised against it"&lt;ref name="notnoble"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hayekbanquet&gt;{{cite web |author=Friedrich von Hayek |authorlink=Friedrich von Hayek |title=Friedrich von Hayek: Banquet Speech |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] |date=10 December 1974 |url=http://nobelprize.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060405023917/http://nobelprize.org/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 April 2006 |accessdate=27 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily because "the Nobel Prize confers on an individual an authority which in economics no man ought to possess... This does not matter in the natural sciences. Here the influence exercised by an individual is chiefly an influence on his fellow experts; and they will soon cut him down to size if he exceeds his competence. But the influence of the economist that mainly matters is an influence over laymen: politicians, journalists, civil servants and the public generally."&lt;ref name=hayekbanquet/&gt;

The [[Kluge Prize]], a $1&amp;nbsp;million prize given by the [[John W. Kluge Center]] at the [[Library of Congress]], is awarded for lifetime achievement in fields of humanistic and social science studies that are not included in the Nobel Prizes, most notably history, philosophy, politics, psychology, anthropology, sociology, religious studies, linguistics, and criticism in the arts and humanities.

The [[Shaw Prize]] is awarded for achievements in the fields of [[astronomy]] and [[mathematical sciences]] besides [[life science]] and medicine.

The [[Tang Prize]] categories include areas of [[sustainable development]] and [[rule of law]] which are not included in Nobel Prize, and also include [[biopharmaceutical|biopharmaceutical science]] and [[sinology]]. The panels of judges are convened by [[Academia Sinica]], located in [[Taiwan]], Republic of China.

===Alternatives to the Nobel Prizes===
Following the announcement of the award of the [[2010 Nobel Peace Prize]] to incarcerated Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, the Chinese tabloid ''[[Global Times]]'' created the [[Confucius Peace Prize]]. The award ceremony was deliberately organized to take place on 8 December, one day before the Nobel ceremony. Organizers said that the prize had no relation to the Chinese government, the Ministry of Culture or Beijing Normal University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael | last=Martina | date=9 December 2010 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/09/us-china-nobel-confucius-idUSTRE6B81YC20101209 | title=China stood up by winner of "Confucius peace prize" | work=Reuters | accessdate=6 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[German National Prize for Art and Science]] was Hitler's alternative to the Nobel Prize.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The [[Ig Nobel Prize]] is an American parody of the Nobel Prize.
