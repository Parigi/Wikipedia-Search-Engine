'''Septimius Severus''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|v|ɪər|ə|s}} {{respell|sə|VEER|əs}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite American Heritage Dictionary|Severus|accessdate=2019-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucius Septimius Severus Augustus;{{efn|[[Latin spelling and pronunciation|Classical Latin spelling and reconstructed Classical Latin pronunciation]]: {{sqc|LVCIVS SEPTIMIVS SEVERVS AVGVSTVS}}, {{IPA-la|ˈluːki.us sepˈtimi.us seˈweːrus au̯ˈɡustus|IPA}}.}} 11 April 145 – 4 February 211) was [[Roman emperor]] from 193 to 211. He was born in [[Leptis Magna]] in the Roman province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]]. As a young man he advanced through [[cursus honorum|the customary succession of offices]] under the reigns of [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Commodus]]. Severus seized power after the death of Emperor [[Pertinax]] in 193 during the [[Year of the Five Emperors]].

After deposing and killing the incumbent emperor [[Didius Julianus]], Severus fought his rival claimants, the Roman generals [[Pescennius Niger]] and [[Clodius Albinus]]. Niger was defeated in 194 at the [[Battle of Issus (194)|Battle of Issus]] in [[Roman Cilicia|Cilicia]]. Later that year Severus waged a short punitive campaign beyond the eastern frontier, annexing the [[Osroene|Kingdom of Osroene]] as a new province. Severus defeated Albinus three years later at the [[Battle of Lugdunum]] in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]].

After consolidating his rule over the western provinces, Severus waged another brief, more successful war in the east against the [[Parthian Empire]], sacking their capital [[Ctesiphon]] in 197 and expanding the eastern frontier to the [[Tigris]]. He then enlarged and fortified the ''[[Limes Arabicus]]'' in [[Arabia Petraea]]. In 202, he campaigned in [[Africa Province|Africa]] and [[Mauretania]] against the [[Garamantes]], capturing their capital [[Germa|Garama]] and expanding the ''[[Limes Tripolitanus]]'' along the southern desert frontier of the empire. He proclaimed as Augusti (co-emperors) his elder son [[Caracalla]] in 198 and his younger son [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] in 209, both born of his second wife [[Julia Domna]].

Severus travelled to [[Roman Britain|Britain]] in 208, strengthening [[Hadrian's Wall]] and reoccupying the [[Antonine Wall]]. In AD 209 he invaded Caledonia (modern Scotland) with an army of 50,000 men&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Elliott|first=Simon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=och2swEACAAJ|title=Septimius Severus in Scotland: The Northern Campaigns of the First Hammer of the Scots|date=2018|publisher=Greenhill Books|year=|isbn=978-1-78438-204-9|location=|pages=147|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his ambitions were cut short when he fell fatally ill of an infectious disease in late 210. He died in early 211 at [[Eboracum]] (today York, England), and was succeeded by his sons, thus founding the [[Severan dynasty]]. It was the last dynasty of the Roman Empire before the [[Crisis of the Third Century]].

== Early life ==

=== Family and education ===
Born on 11 April 145 at [[Leptis Magna]] (in present-day [[Libya]]) as the son of [[Publius Septimius Geta (father of Septimius Severus)|Publius Septimius Geta]] and [[Fulvia Pia]],&lt;ref name="Birley 1999, p. 1" /&gt; Septimius Severus came from a wealthy and distinguished family of [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] rank. He had [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italian]] Roman ancestry on his mother's side, and was descended from [[Punics|Punic]] forebears on his father's side.&lt;ref name="Birley 1999, pp. 212–213"&gt;Birley (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;212–213.&lt;/ref&gt;

Severus' father, an obscure provincial, held no major political status, but he had two cousins, Publius Septimius Aper and Gaius Septimius Severus, who served as consuls under the emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] {{reign|138|161}}. His mother's ancestors had moved from [[Italy]] to [[North Africa]]; they belonged to the [[Fulvia (gens)|''gens'' Fulvia]], an [[Italy (Roman Empire)|Italian]] [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician family]] that originated in [[Tusculum]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam, Alexander, ''Classical biography'',[https://books.google.com/books?id=x2UBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=classical+biography+gens+fulvia+cicero+tusculum&amp;hl=it&amp;ei=U0ZYTseHGsmi-gbFrJSuDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=fulvius%20gens&amp;f=false Google eBook] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610001757/https://books.google.com/books?id=x2UBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=classical+biography+gens+fulvia+cicero+tusculum&amp;hl=it&amp;ei=U0ZYTseHGsmi-gbFrJSuDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=fulvius%20gens&amp;f=false |date=10 June 2016}}, p.182: ''FULVIUS, the name of a "gens" which originally came from Tusculum (Cic. Planc. 8)''.&lt;/ref&gt; Septimius Severus had two siblings: an elder brother, [[Publius Septimius Geta (brother of Septimius Severus)|Publius Septimius Geta]]; and a younger sister, Septimia Octavilla. Severus's maternal cousin was the [[praetorian prefect]] and consul [[Gaius Fulvius Plautianus]].&lt;ref name="Birley 1999, pp. 216–217"&gt;Birley (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;216–217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Septimius Severus grew up in Leptis Magna. He spoke the local [[Punic language]] fluently, but he was also educated in [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], which he spoke with a slight accent. Little else is known of the young Severus' education but, according to [[Cassius Dio]], the boy had been eager for more education than he actually received. Presumably Severus received lessons in [[oratory (worship)|oratory]]: at the age of 17 he gave his first public speech.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public service ===

Severus sought a public career in [[Rome]] in around 162. At the recommendation of his relative Gaius Septimius Severus, Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] ({{reign|161|180}}) granted him entry into the senatorial ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership in the senatorial order was a prerequisite to attain positions within the ''[[cursus honorum]]'' and to gain entry into the Roman Senate. Nevertheless, it appears that Severus' career during the 160s met with some difficulties.&lt;ref name="birley-40"&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;40.&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that he served as a ''[[vigintisexviri|vigintivir]]'' in Rome, overseeing road maintenance in or near the city, and he may have appeared in court as an advocate.&lt;ref name=birley-40/&gt; At the time of Marcus Aurelius he was the State Attorney (''Advocatus fisci'').&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', London 1870, v. 3, pg. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he omitted the [[Military tribune|military tribunate]] from the ''cursus honorum'' and had to delay his [[quaestor]]ship until he had reached the required minimum age of 25.&lt;ref name=birley-40/&gt; To make matters worse, the [[Antonine Plague]] swept through the capital in 166.&lt;ref name="Birley 1999, p. 45"&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;45.&lt;/ref&gt;

With his career at a halt, Severus decided to temporarily return to Leptis, where the climate was healthier.&lt;ref name="Birley 1999, p. 45"/&gt; According to the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', a usually unreliable source, he was prosecuted for [[adultery]] during this time but the case was ultimately dismissed. At the end of 169 Severus was of the required age to become a quaestor and journeyed back to Rome. On 5{{nbs}}December, he took office and was officially enrolled in the [[Roman Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 170 and 180 his activities went largely unrecorded, in spite of the fact that he occupied an impressive number of posts in quick succession. The [[Antonine Plague]] had thinned the senatorial ranks and, with capable men now in short supply, Severus' career advanced more steadily than it otherwise might have.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sudden death of his father necessitated another return to Leptis Magna to settle family affairs. Before he was able to leave Africa, [[Mauri people|Mauri]] tribesmen invaded southern Spain. Control of the province was handed over to the Emperor, while the Senate gained temporary control of [[Sardinia]] [[Senatorial province|as compensation]]. Thus, Septimius Severus spent the remainder of his second term as quaestor on the island of [[Sardinia]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 173, Severus' kinsman Gaius Septimius Severus was appointed [[proconsul]] of the Province of Africa. The elder Severus chose his cousin as one of his two ''[[legatus|legati pro praetore]]'', a senior military appointment.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;51.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of this term, Septimius Severus returned to Rome, taking up office as [[tribune of the plebs]], a senior legislative position, with the distinction of being the ''candidatus'' of the emperor.&lt;ref name=birley-52&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;52.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriages ===

About 175, Septimius Severus, in his early thirties at the time, contracted his first marriage, to [[Paccia Marciana]], a woman from Leptis Magna.&lt;ref name="birley" /&gt; He probably met her during his tenure as [[Legatus|legate]] under his uncle. Marciana's name suggests Punic or Libyan origin, but nothing else is known of her. Septimius Severus does not mention her in his autobiography, though he commemorated her with statues when he became Emperor. The unreliable ''Historia Augusta'' claims that Marciana and Severus had two daughters, but no other attestation of them has survived. It appears that the marriage produced no surviving children, despite lasting for more than ten years.&lt;ref name=birley-52/&gt;

Marciana died of natural causes around 186.&lt;ref name=birley-75&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;75.&lt;/ref&gt; Septimius Severus, now in his forties, childless and eager to remarry, began enquiring into the horoscopes of prospective brides. The ''Historia Augusta'' relates that he heard of a woman in Syria of whom it had been foretold that she would marry a king, and so Severus sought her as his wife.&lt;ref name="birley"&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;71.&lt;/ref&gt; This woman was an Emesan [[Syrian]] named [[Julia Domna]]. Her father, [[Julius Bassianus]], descended from the royal house of [[Royal family of Emesa|Samsigeramus and Sohaemus]] and served as a [[high priest]] to the local cult of the sun god [[Elagabalus (deity)|Elagabal]].&lt;ref name=birley-72&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;72.&lt;/ref&gt; Domna's older sister, [[Julia Maesa]], would become the grandmother of the future emperors [[Elagabalus]] and [[Alexander Severus]].&lt;ref name="dio-history-lxxix-30"&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/79*.html#78-30 LXXIX.30] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120526042142/http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/79*.html#78-30 |date=26 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bassianus accepted Severus' marriage proposal in early 187, and in the summer the couple married in [[Lugdunum]] (modern-day [[Lyon]], France), of which Severus was the governor.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;76–77; Fishwick (2005), p.&amp;nbsp;347.&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage proved happy, and Severus cherished Julia and her political opinions. Julia built "the most splendid reputation" by applying herself to letters and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon (1831), p.&amp;nbsp;74.&lt;/ref&gt; They had two sons, [[Caracalla|Lucius Septimius Bassianus]] (later nicknamed Caracalla, born 4{{nbs}}April 188 in Lugdunum) and [[Publius Septimius Geta]] (born 7{{nbs}}March 189 in Rome).&lt;ref name=birley-76-77&gt;Birley (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;76–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rise to power ==
[[File:Carole Raddato (13543792233).jpg|thumb| The [[Severan Tondo]], c. 199, Severus, Julia Domna, Caracalla and Geta, whose face is erased. ([[Antikensammlung Berlin]])]]
In 191, on the advice of [[Quintus Aemilius Laetus]], prefect of the [[Praetorian Guard]], [[Commodus]] appointed Severus as governor of [[Pannonia Superior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Matthew|last= Bunson|
location= Roma|isbn= 9788882896270 |publisher= Newton &amp; Compton|url= https://books.google.com/?id=T5tic2VunRoC&amp;lpg=PA300&amp;dq=commodus%20septimius%20severus%20191&amp;pg=PA300#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire|year= 2002|p= 300}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commodus was assassinated the following year. [[Pertinax]] was acclaimed emperor, but he was then killed by the Praetorian Guard in early 193. In response to the murder of Pertinax, Severus's legion [[Legio XIV Gemina|''XIV Gemina'']] proclaimed him Emperor at [[Carnuntum]]. Nearby legions, such as [[Legio X Gemina|''X Gemina'']] at [[Vindobona]], soon followed suit. Having assembled an army, Severus hurried to Italy.{{sfn|Campbell|1994|pp= 40–41}}

Pertinax's successor in Rome, [[Didius Julianus]], had bought the emperorship in an auction. Julianus was condemned to death by the Senate and killed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/74*.html Roman History], LXXIV.17.4&lt;/ref&gt; Severus took possession of Rome without opposition. He executed Pertinax's murderers and dismissed the rest of the [[Praetorian Guard]], filling its ranks with loyal troops from his own legions.&lt;ref name=Dio75&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/75*.html Roman History], LXXV.1.1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Birley 1999, p. 113"&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;113.&lt;/ref&gt;

The legions of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] had proclaimed [[Pescennius Niger]] emperor. At the same time Severus felt it reasonable to offer [[Clodius Albinus]], the powerful governor of [[Britannia]], who had probably supported Didius against him, the rank of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]], which implied some claim to succession. With his rear safe, he moved to the East and crushed Niger's forces at the [[Battle of Issus (194)|Battle of Issus]] (194).&lt;ref name="Birley 1999, p. 113"/&gt; While campaigning against [[Byzantium]], he ordered that the tomb of his [[Ancient Carthage|fellow-Carthaginian]] [[Hannibal]] be covered with fine marble.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel, Richard A. ''Hannibal: The Military Biography of Rome's Greatest Enemy'', Potomac Books, Inc., 2011 {{ISBN|1-59797-766-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=h-VlDC4Jt6gC&amp;pg=PT265&amp;lpg=PT265&amp;dq=severus+byzantium+hannibal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HST8J5ttou&amp;sig=yMX5VdF_dc8z87ThTwVu8VDpYFQ&amp;hl=el&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PkujUemCGqX44QSr-YAg&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

He devoted the following year  to suppressing [[Mesopotamia]] and other [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] vassals who had backed Niger. Afterwards Severus declared his son [[Caracalla]] as his successor, which caused Albinus to be hailed emperor by his troops and to invade Gallia. After a short stay in Rome, Severus moved north to meet him. On 19{{nbs}}February 197 at the [[Battle of Lugdunum]], with an army of about 75,000 men, mostly composed of [[Pannonia]]n, [[Moesia]]n and [[Dacia]]n legions and a large number of auxiliaries, Severus defeated and killed Clodius Albinus, securing his full control over the empire.&lt;ref&gt;

In early 197 Severus departed Rome and travelled to the east by sea. He embarked at [[Brundisium]] and probably landed at the port of [[History of Yumurtalık|Aegeae]] in [[Cilicia]],&lt;ref&gt;Hasebroek (1921), p.&amp;nbsp;111.&lt;/ref&gt; travelling to [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] by land. He immediately gathered his army and crossed the [[Euphrates]].&lt;ref&gt;"Life of Septimius Severus" in ''Historia Augusta'', 16.1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abgar IX]], titular King of Osroene but essentially only the ruler of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] since the annexation of his kingdom as a Roman province,&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;115.&lt;/ref&gt; handed over his children as hostages and assisted Severus' expedition by providing archers.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;129.&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Khosrov I of Armenia]] also sent hostages, money and gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Hovannisian, ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century'', p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

Severus traveled on to [[Nisibis]], which his general [[Julius Laetus]] had prevented from falling into enemy hands. Afterwards Severus returned to Syria to plan a more ambitious campaign.&lt;ref&gt;''Prosopographia Imperii Romani'' L 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he led another, more successful campaign against the Parthian Empire, reportedly in retaliation for the support it had given to [[Pescennius Niger]]. His legions sacked the Parthian royal city of [[Battle of Ctesiphon (198)|Ctesiphon]] and he annexed the northern half of [[Mesopotamia]] to the empire,&lt;ref name="Birley 1999, p. 153"&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;130.&lt;/ref&gt; taking the title ''{{lang|la|Parthicus Maximus}}'', following the example of [[Trajan]].&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite encyclopedia | article = Ctesiphon | last = Kröger | first = Jens | authorlink =  | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ctesiphon | editor-last = | editor-first =  | editor-link = | encyclopedia  = Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. IV, Fasc. 4 | pages = 446–448 | location = | publisher = | year = 1993 | isbn = |ref=harv}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was unable to capture the fortress of [[Hatra]] even after two lengthy sieges, just like Trajan who had tried nearly a century before. During his time in the east, though, he also expanded the ''[[Limes Arabicus]]'', building new fortifications in the [[Arabian Desert]] from [[Qasr Azraq|Basie]] to [[Dumat Al-Jandal|Dumatha]].&lt;ref name="Birley 1999, p. 134"&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;134.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with the Senate and People===
Severus' relations with the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] were never good. He was unpopular with them from the outset, having seized power with the help of the military, and he returned the sentiment. Severus ordered the execution of a large number of Senators on charges of corruption or [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] against him and replaced them with his favourites. Although his actions turned Rome more into a military [[dictatorship]], he was popular with the citizens of Rome, having stamped out the rampant corruption of Commodus's reign. When he returned from his victory over the Parthians, he erected the [[Arch of Septimius Severus]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Asante, Molefi Kete and Shanza Ismail, “Rediscovering the ‘Lost’Roman Caesar: Septimius Severus the African and Eurocentric Historiography.” Journal of Black Studies 40, no. 4 (March 2010): 606–618&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perkins|first1=J. B. Ward|title=The Arch of Septimius Severus at Lepcis Magna|journal=Archaeology|date=December 1951|volume= 4|issue= 4|pages=226–231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cassius Dio,&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', Book 76, Sections 14 and 15.&lt;/ref&gt; however, after 197 Severus fell heavily under the influence of his Praetorian Prefect, [[Gaius Fulvius Plautianus]], who came to have almost total control of the imperial administration. Plautianus's daughter, [[Fulvia Plautilla]], was married to Severus's son, Caracalla. Plautianus's excessive power came to an end in 204, when he was denounced by the Emperor's dying brother. In January 205 Caracalla accused Plautianus of plotting to kill him and Severus. The powerful prefect was executed while he was trying to defend his case in front of the two emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), pp. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the two following ''praefecti'' was the famous jurist [[Papinian]]. Executions of senators did not stop: Cassius Dio records that many of them were put to death, some after being formally tried.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military reforms===

Upon his arrival at Rome in 193, Severus discharged the [[Praetorian Guard]],&lt;ref name=Dio75/&gt; which had murdered Pertinax and had then auctioned the Roman Empire to Didius Julianus. Its members were stripped of their ceremonial armour and forbidden to come within {{convert|160|km|0}} miles of the city on pain of death.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;103.&lt;/ref&gt; Severus replaced the old guard with 10 new cohorts recruited from veterans of his Danubian legions.&lt;ref name=Adkins&gt;Lesley Adkins and Roy A. Adkins, Both Professional ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zGY1Sqjwf8kC&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;ots=gqddfw9YPy&amp;dq=septimius%20severus%20praetorian%20guard&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome]'', p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 197&lt;ref&gt;George Ronald Watson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PSEnmtuOh6K0C&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;ots=nq09eXs4Fm&amp;dq=septimius%20severus%20number%20of%20legions&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Roman Soldier], p.23&lt;/ref&gt; he increased the number of legions from 30 to 33, with the introduction of the three new legions: I, II, and III ''Parthica''. He garrisoned [[Legio II Parthica]] at [[Albano Laziale|Albanum]], only {{convert|20|km|mi}} from Rome.&lt;ref name=Adkins/&gt; He gave his soldiers a [[donativum|donative]] of a thousand ''[[sestertius|sesterces]]'' (250 ''[[denarius|denarii]]'') each,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/miscellanea/numismatics/severus.html|title=Septimius Severus: Legionary Denarius|website=penelope.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised the annual wage for a soldier in the legions from 300 to 400 ''denarii''.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth W. Harl, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5yPDL0EykeAC&amp;lpg=PA216&amp;ots=VcHE96FRuM&amp;dq=septimius%20severus%20legion%20pay&amp;pg=PA216#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Coinage in the Roman Economy, 300 B.C. to A.D. 700, Part 700]'', p.216&lt;/ref&gt;

Severus was the first Roman emperor to station some of the imperial army in Italy. He realized that Rome needed a military central reserve with the capability to be sent anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Grant(1978); History of Rome; p.358;Charles Scribner's Sons; NY&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reputed persecution of Christians ===
At the beginning of Severus' reign, [[Trajan]]'s policy toward the Christians was still in force. That is, Christians were only to be punished if they refused to worship the emperor and the gods, but they were not to be sought out.{{sfn|González|2010|p=97}} Therefore, persecution was inconsistent, local, and sporadic. Faced with internal dissidence and external threats, Severus felt the need to promote religious harmony by promoting [[syncretism]].{{sfn|González|2010|pp=97–98}} He, possibly, issued an edict&lt;ref name=HA&gt;''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Septimius_Severus*.html Historia Augusta]'', Septimius Severus, 17.1&lt;/ref&gt; that punished conversion to Judaism and Christianity.{{sfn|Tabbernee|2007|pp=182–183}}

A number of [[persecution]]s of Christians occurred in the Roman Empire during his reign and are traditionally attributed to Severus by the early Christian community.{{sfn|Tabbernee|2007|p=182}} This is based on the decree mentioned in the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'',&lt;ref name=HA/&gt; an unreliable mix of fact and fiction.{{sfn|Tabbernee|2007|p=184}} Early church historian [[Eusebius]] described Severus as a persecutor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius]], ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', VI.1.1&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]] [[Tertullian]] stated that Severus was well disposed towards Christians,&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|la}} [[Tertullian]], ''[http://www.tertullian.org/latin/ad_scapulam.htm Ad Scapulam] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025174903/http://www.tertullian.org/latin/ad_scapulam.htm |date=25 October 2015 }}'', IV.5–6&lt;/ref&gt; employed a Christian as his personal physician and had personally intervened to save several high-born Christians known to him from the mob.{{sfn|Tabbernee|2007|p=184}} Eusebius' description of Severus as a persecutor likely derives merely from the fact that numerous persecutions occurred during his reign, including those known in the ''[[Roman Martyrology]]'' as the martyrs of [[Madauros]], [[Charalambos]] and [[Perpetua and Felicity]] in [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman-ruled Africa]]. These were probably the result of local persecutions rather than empire-wide actions or decrees by Severus.{{sfn|Tabbernee|2007|p=185}}

=== Military activity ===

==== Africa (202) ====

[[File:Septimius Severus' African conquests1.jpg|thumb|450px|The expansion of the African frontier during the reign of Severus (medium tan). Severus even briefly held a military presence in Garama in 203 (light tan).]]

In late 202 Severus launched a campaign in the province of Africa. The [[legatus|legate]] of [[Legio III Augusta]], [[Quintus Anicius Faustus]], had been fighting against the [[Garamantes]] along the ''[[Limes Tripolitanus]]'' for five years. He captured several settlements such as [[Ghadames|Cydamus]], Gholaia, Garbia, and their capital [[Germa|Garama]] – over {{convert|600|km|mi}} south of [[Leptis Magna]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The province of [[Numidia]] was also enlarged: the empire annexed the settlements of [[Biskra|Vescera]], [[Messaad|Castellum Dimmidi]], [[M'Lili|Gemellae]], [[Tehouda|Thabudeos]] and [[Tubunae|Thubunae]]&lt;!-- Zabi probably simply means "village" in local dialect --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; By 203 the entire southern frontier of Roman Africa had been dramatically expanded and re-fortified. Desert nomads could no longer safely raid the region's interior and escape back into the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref name="Birley 1999, p. 153"/&gt;

==== Britain (208) ====
In 208 Severus travelled to Britain with the intention of conquering [[Caledonia]]. Modern archaeological discoveries illuminate the scope and direction of his northern campaign.&lt;ref name="Birley 1999 180"&gt;Birley, (1999) p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Severus probably arrived in Britain with an army over 40,000, considering some of the camps constructed during his campaign could house this number.&lt;ref&gt;W.S. Hanson [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_109/109_140_150.pdf "Roman campaigns north of the Forth-Clyde isthmus: the evidence of the temporary camps"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107022132/http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_109/109_140_150.pdf |date=7 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He strengthened [[Hadrian's Wall]] and reconquered the [[Southern Uplands]] up to the [[Antonine Wall]], which was also enhanced. Severus built a {{convert|165|acre|0|adj=on}} camp south of the Antonine Wall at [[Trimontium (Newstead)|Trimontium]], probably assembling his forces there.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;180–181.&lt;/ref&gt; Severus then thrust north with his army across the wall into Caledonian territory. Retracing the steps of [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]] of over a century before, Severus rebuilt and garrisoned many abandoned Roman forts along the east coast, such as [[Carpow Roman Fort|Carpow]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/30081/carpow|title=Carpow {{!}} Canmore|website=canmore.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180516015140/https://canmore.org.uk/site/30081/carpow|archive-date=16 May 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was supported and supplied by a strong naval force.&lt;ref name="Scotland"/&gt;

[[File:Kushan ring with Septimus Severus and Julia Domna.jpg|thumb|[[Kushan]] ring with portraits of Septimus Severus and [[Julia Domna]], a testimony to [[Indo-Roman relations]] of the period.]]

Around this time Severus' wife, Julia Domna, reportedly criticised the sexual morals of the Caledonian women. The wife of Caledonian chief Argentocoxos replied: "We fulfill the demands of nature in a much better way than do you Roman women; for we consort openly with the best men, whereas you let yourselves be debauched in secret by the vilest".&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/77*.html "Roman History: Epitome of Book LXXVII"] University of Chicago. Retrieved 24 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cassius Dio]]'s account of the invasion reads:
{{quote|Severus, accordingly, desiring to subjugate the whole of it, invaded Caledonia. But as he advanced through the country he experienced countless hardships in cutting down the forests, levelling the heights, filling up the swamps, and bridging the rivers; but he fought no battle and beheld no enemy in battle array. The enemy purposely put sheep and cattle in front of the soldiers for them to seize, in order that they might be lured on still further until they were worn out; for in fact the water caused great suffering to the Romans, and when they became scattered, they would be attacked. Then, unable to walk, they would be slain by their own men, in order to avoid capture, so that a full fifty thousand died. But Severus did not desist until he approached the extremity of the island. Here he observed most accurately the variation of the sun's motion and the length of the days and the nights in summer and winter respectively. Having thus been conveyed through practically the whole of the hostile country (for he actually was conveyed in a covered litter most of the way, on account of his infirmity), he returned to the friendly portion, after he had forced the Britons to come to terms, on the condition that they should abandon a large part of their territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/77*.html |title=Cassius Dio — Epitome of Book 77 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By 210 Severus' campaigning had made significant gains, despite Caledonian guerrilla tactics and purportedly heavy Roman casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Keys |first1=David |title=Ancient Roman 'hand of god' discovered near Hadrian's Wall sheds light on biggest combat operation ever in UK |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/hand-of-god-ancient-roman-hadrians-wall-sculpture-bronze-found-latest-a8419131.html |accessdate=6 July 2018 |agency=Independent |date=27 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707015802/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/hand-of-god-ancient-roman-hadrians-wall-sculpture-bronze-found-latest-a8419131.html |archive-date=7 July 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caledonians sued for peace, which Severus granted on condition they relinquish control of the Central Lowlands.&lt;ref name="Birley 1999 180"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History: Epitome of Book LXXVII.13.&lt;/ref&gt; This is evidenced by extensive Severan-era fortifications in the Central Lowlands.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999) pp. 180–82.&lt;/ref&gt; The Caledonians, short on supplies and feeling that their position was desperate, revolted later that year with the [[Maeatae]].&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999) p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Severus prepared for another protracted campaign within Caledonia. He was now intent on exterminating the Caledonians, telling his soldiers: "Let no-one escape sheer destruction, no-one our hands, not even the babe in the womb of the mother, if it be male; let it nevertheless not escape sheer destruction."&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius (Xiphilinus) 'Romaika' Epitome of Book LXXVI Chapter 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotland"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Laura|title=The Honest Truth: How the Romans came close but ultimately failed to conquer Scotland under Septimius Severus|url=https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/the-honest-truth-how-the-romans-came-close-but-ultimately-failed-to-conquer-scotland-under-septimius-severus/|accessdate=21 May 2018|publisher=The Sunday Post|date=16 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180521164647/https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/the-honest-truth-how-the-romans-came-close-but-ultimately-failed-to-conquer-scotland-under-septimius-severus/|archive-date=21 May 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death (211) ===
Severus' campaign was cut short when he fell ill.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', Book 77, Sections 11–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;170–187.&lt;/ref&gt; He withdrew to [[Eboracum]] (York) and died there in 211.&lt;ref name="Birley 1999, p. 187" /&gt; Although his son Caracalla continued campaigning the following year, he soon settled for peace. The Romans never campaigned deep into Caledonia again. Shortly after this the frontier was permanently withdrawn south to Hadrian's Wall.&lt;ref&gt;Birley (1999), pp. 170–187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Severus is famously said to have given the advice to his sons: "Be harmonious, enrich the soldiers, scorn all others" before he died on 4 February 211.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', Book 77, Section 15.&lt;/ref&gt; On his death, Severus was [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|deified]] by the Senate and succeeded by his sons, [[Caracalla]] and [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]], who were advised by his wife [[Julia Domna]].&lt;ref&gt;"Life of Septimius Severus" in ''Historia Augusta'', Section 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Severus was buried in the [[Castel Sant'Angelo|Mausoleum of Hadrian]] in Rome.

The silver purity decreased from 78.5% to 64.5% – the silver weight dropping from 2.46&amp;nbsp;grams to 1.98&amp;nbsp;grams.
