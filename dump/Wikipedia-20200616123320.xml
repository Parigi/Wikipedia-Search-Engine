'''Ronald Wayne''' (born May 17, 1934) is a retired American electronics industry businessman. He co-founded Apple Computer Company (now [[Apple Inc.]]) as a partnership with [[Steve Wozniak]] and [[Steve Jobs]], providing administrative oversight and documentation for the new venture. Twelve days later, he sold his 10% share of the new company back to Jobs and Wozniak for {{US$|800}}, and one year later accepted a final {{US$|1500}} to forfeit any potential future claims against the newly incorporated Apple, totaling {{US$|2300}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Martin |first1=Emmie |title=Apple hit a $1 trillion market cap—here's why its third co-founder sold his 10% stake for $800 |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/02/why-ronald-wayne-sold-his-10-percent-stake-in-apple-for-800-dollars.html |accessdate=2 August 2018 |work=CNBC |date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Just nine of the world's richest men have more combined wealth than the poorest 4 billion people |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/richest-billionaires-combined-wealth-jeff-bezos-bill-gates-warren-buffett-mark-zuckerberg-carlos-a8163621.html |accessdate=2 August 2018 |work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Dave | last=Lee | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35940300 | title=Apple at 40: The forgotten founder who gave it all away | work=[[BBC News]] | date=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Wayne was born in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], United States on May 17, 1934.&lt;ref name="ronaldgwayne.com/bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ronaldgwayne.com/bio |title=Bio |publisher=Ronald G Wayne official site| accessdate= September 2, 2015 | archivedate = February 23, 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223222157/http://www.ronaldgwayne.com/bio | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He trained as a technical draftsman at the [[High School of Art and Design|School of Industrial Art]] in New York.&lt;ref name=Dormehl/&gt;

==Career==
In 1956, aged 22, he moved to California. In 1971, Wayne started his first business, a company selling [[slot machine]]s. The company failed, with Wayne reflecting in 2014 that, "I discovered very quickly that I had no business being in business. I was far better working in engineering."&lt;ref name=Dormehl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultofmac.com/304686/ron-wayne-apple-co-founder/|first=Luke|last= Dormehl|publisher=Cult of Mac|title=The oddly uplifting story of the Apple co-founder who sold his stake for $800|date=December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apple===
In 1976, Ronald Wayne built the internal corporate documentation systems at the three-year-old [[Atari]],&lt;ref name="On Co-founding Apple"/&gt; where he met coworkers [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Steve Wozniak]].&lt;ref name="Steve Jobs book"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Walter Isaacson | first=Walter | last=Isaacson | title=[[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]] | publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year=2011 | isbn=978-1451648539 | page=[https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/44 44] }}&lt;/ref&gt; To help settle one of their typical intense discussions about the design of computers and the future of the industry, Wayne invited the two to his home to facilitate and advise them. In the ensuing two-hour conversation about technology and business, Jobs proposed the founding of a computer company led by him and Wozniak. Those two would each hold a 45% stake so that Wayne could receive a 10% stake to act as a tie-breaker in their decisions.&lt;ref name="Pahrum Nevada Man"/&gt; As the venture's self-described "adult in the room"&lt;ref name="On Co-founding Apple"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mercurynews"/&gt; at age 41, Wayne wrote a [[partnership agreement]] and the three founded [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] on April 1, 1976. Wayne illustrated the first [[Apple logo]],&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/7624539/US-pensioner-Ronald-Wayne-gave-up-15bn-slice-of-Apple.html |title=US pensioner Ronald Wayne gave up £15bn slice of Apple| work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| location =UK|date= April 23, 2010|accessdate= September 2, 2015| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121114123759/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/7624539/US-pensioner-Ronald-Wayne-gave-up-15bn-slice-of-Apple.html | archivedate=November 14, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote the [[Apple I]] manual.&lt;ref name="On Co-founding Apple"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mercurynews"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_15214122| title= Woz, Jobs and ...

When Jobs and Wozniak filed for incorporation a year later, Wayne received a letter asking him to officially forfeit any claims against the company, and he received another check, this time for $1,500.| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100603032439/http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_15214122 | archivedate=June 3, 2010| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="woz.org"&gt;{{cite web| authorlink=Steve Wozniak|last=Wozniak|first=Steve | url = http://www.woz.org/letters/pirates/09.html |title= Letters-General Questions Answered | publisher= Steve Wozniak official site |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000817234627/http://www.woz.org/letters/pirates/09.html | archivedate=August 17, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wayne's business attitude was already risk-averse due to his experience five years prior with the "very traumatic" failure of his [[slot machine]] business, the debt of which he had spent one year voluntarily repaying.&lt;ref name="On Co-founding Apple"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mercurynews"/&gt; Jobs secured a {{US$|15000}} line of credit to buy product materials for Apple's first order which had been placed by The Byte Shop, whose reputation as a notoriously slow paying vendor gave Wayne great concern for his future.&lt;ref name="On Co-founding Apple"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pahrum Nevada Man"/&gt; Legally, all members of a [[partnership taxation in the United States|partnership]] are personally responsible for any debts incurred by any partner; unlike Jobs and Wozniak, then 21 and 25, Wayne had personal assets that potential creditors could possibly seize.&lt;ref name="woz.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seibold"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.applematters.com/article/april-12-1976-ron-wayne-apples-third-founder-quits/|title=April 12, 1976: Ron Wayne, Apple’s Third Founder, Quits|publisher=Apple Matters|first=Chris|last= Seibold|date=April 12, 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150201072410/http://www.applematters.com/article/april-12-1976-ron-wayne-apples-third-founder-quits/ | archivedate= February 1, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, his passion was in original product engineering and in slot machines, and not in the documentation systems he assumed Jobs and Wozniak probably wanted him to do indefinitely at Apple. Believing he was "standing in the shadow of giants" of product design talent and avoiding financial risk, he quit the company.&lt;ref name="On Co-founding Apple"/&gt; Reportedly, "Twelve days after Wayne wrote the document that formally created Apple, he returned to the registrar's office and renounced his role in the company", therefore relinquishing his equity in exchange for {{US$|800}} on April 12, 1976.&lt;ref name="woz.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/web/06/24/apple.forgotten.founder/index.html?hpt=C1&amp;fbid=lG95iTlU4iD |title=The gambling man who co-founded Apple and left for $800 |publisher=[[CNN]] |first=Dan |last=Simon |date=June 24, 2010 |accessdate=June 24, 2010 | quote= Wayne left Apple for only $800.

Wayne has stated in following decades that he does not regret selling his share of the company as he made the "best decision with the information available to me at the time".&lt;ref name="linzmayer"&gt;{{cite book| last=Linzmayer|first= Owen W. | url = http://extras.denverpost.com/books/chap0411h.htm | chapter=Chapter one: The Forgotten Founder | title=Apple Confidential: The Real Story of Apple Computer, Inc.| publisher= No Starch Press via  [[The Denver Post]] | accessdate=March 31, 2010| archivedate=April 11, 2015| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411151150/http://extras.denverpost.com/books/chap0411h.htm | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he had originally believed that the Apple enterprise "would be successful, but at the same time there would be significant bumps along the way and I couldn't risk it. I had already had a rather unfortunate business experience before. I was getting too old and those two were whirlwinds. It was like having a tiger by the tail and I couldn't keep up with these guys."&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; Although Apple ended up becoming one of the most valuable companies in the world, he said that with the stress of staying with Apple he "probably would have wound up the richest man in the cemetery."&lt;ref name="On Co-founding Apple"/&gt; He summarized, "What can I say? You make a decision based on your understanding of the circumstances, and you live with it."&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

===After Apple===
After leaving Apple, Wayne resisted Jobs's attempts to get him to return, remaining at [[Atari]] until 1978, when he joined [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] and later an electronics company in [[Salinas, California]].&lt;ref name="linzmayer"/&gt;

In the late 1970s, Wayne had run a stamp shop in [[Milpitas, California]] for a short time, Wayne's Philatelics.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} After a number of break-ins, he moved his stamp operations to Nevada.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The logo for the business was a wood-cut style design, with a man sitting under an apple tree, with the "Wayne's Philatelics" name written in a flowing ribbon curved around the tree. This had the same basis as the original logo he designed for Apple Computer.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Steve Jobs approached him again as a business contact for Apple, but Wayne refused to even forward Jobs's proposal to purchase a friend's company. Wayne's principle was that his friend should retain ownership under exclusive license to Apple instead of selling, but he would later express regret for having blocked the contact instead of allowing the decision to be made directly.&lt;ref name="On Co-founding Apple"/&gt;

In the early 1990s, Wayne sold the original Apple partnership contract paper, signed in 1976 by Jobs, Wozniak, and himself, for {{US$|500}}. In 2011, the contract was sold at auction for $1.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2011/fine-books-manuscripts-n08811/lot.241.html|title=Sotheby's listing of the sold item|last=|first=|date=|website=Sotheby's|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wayne has stated that he regrets that sale.&lt;ref name=Dormehl /&gt;&lt;ref name="On Co-founding Apple"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nextshark.com/ronald-wayne-interview/|title=Ronald Wayne: On Co-founding Apple and Working With Steve Jobs|first=Benny|last= Luo |date=September 12, 2013|publisher=Nextshark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/electronics/8954476/Apples-founding-document-sold-for-1.59m-at-auction.html|title=Apple's founding document sold for $1.59m at auction| first= Richard |last=Blackden|date=December 13, 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph| archivedate= February 24, 2016| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160224130215/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/electronics/8954476/Apples-founding-document-sold-for-1.59m-at-auction.html | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wayne retired to a [[Trailer park|mobile home park]] in [[Pahrump, Nevada]], where he sells stamps and rare coins, and plays penny slots at a casino.&lt;ref name="Pahrum Nevada Man"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.realpahrump.com/pahrump-nevada-man-could-have-been-apple-billionaire/|title=Pahrump Nevada Man Could Have Been Apple Billionaire now lives in Mobile Home Park|date=June 25, 2010|accessdate=July 5, 2010 | publisher=RealPaurump.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140828024328/http://realpahrump.com/pahrump-nevada-man-could-have-been-apple-billionaire/ | archivedate = August 28, 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wayne never owned an Apple product&lt;ref name="mercurynews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="seattletimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2012074368_appleguy10.html|title=For obscure Apple co-founder, misstep was a costly one|first=Bruce |last=Newman|date=June 9, 2010|work=[[The Seattle Times]] | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110831041622/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2012074368_appleguy10.html | archivedate= August 31, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 2011, when he was given an [[iPad 2]] at the Update Conference in [[Brighton]], England.&lt;ref name=TheNextWeb&gt;{{cite news|last=Brian|first=Matt|title=Apple’s co-founder Ron Wayne on its genesis, his exit and the company’s future|url=https://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/09/11/apples-co-founder-ron-wayne-on-its-genesis-his-exit-and-the-companys-future/|accessdate=September 13, 2011|newspaper=The Next Web|date=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds a dozen patents.&lt;ref name = "Wired"&gt;{{cite web|author= John C Abell|url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/06/apple-co-founder-ron-waynes-long-strange-and-sad-trip/ |title=Apple Co-Founder Ron Wayne’s Long, Strange – and Sad – Trip |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]  |date=June 3, 2010 |accessdate=November 11, 2010 | archiveurl = https://www.wired.com/2010/06/apple-co-founder-ron-waynes-long-strange-and-sad-trip|archivedate=October 27, 2014 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
In July 2011, Wayne published a memoir titled ''Adventures of an Apple Founder''. His plan for initial exclusivity on the Apple [[iBooks]] store did not materialize.&lt;ref name = "Official Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ronaldgwayne.com/page/adventures-apple-founder |title=Adventures of an Apple Founder on iTunes store |publisher=Ronald G Wayne |date=September 3, 2011 |accessdate=November 11, 2010 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111001065641/http://ronaldgwayne.com/content/adventures-apple-founder-itunes-store | archivedate=October 1, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a socio-economic treatise titled ''Insolence of Office'', released on October 1, 2011 which he describes as this:&lt;ref name="Official Website"/&gt;{{quote|...the product of decades of research and observation into the evolution of human governance, and the foundations of the American Constitutional Republic. Through this analysis, the reader is introduced to a complete, yet simplified understanding of the architecture of our Constitution, its foundations, principles, and the essential meaning of its structure all in the context of modern living.}}

He appeared in the documentary ''[[Welcome to Macintosh (film)|Welcome to Macintosh]]'' in 2008, where he describes some of his early experiences with Jobs and Wozniak.&lt;ref name="Doc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OHdTqK4K2I|title=Life Before Apple|author=512k Entertainment|date=January 1, 2008|archivedate=May 8, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508183209/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OHdTqK4K2I|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
