[[File:Nobel Prize 2010-Press Conference KVA-DSC 8021.jpg|thumbnail|The Japanese Nobel Prize Laureate (2010) [[Akira Suzuki (chemist)|Akira Suzuki]] and [[Ei-ichi Negishi]]]]

Since 1949, there have been twenty-eight [[Japan]]ese winners of the '''[[Nobel Prize]]'''. The Nobel Prize is a Sweden-based international monetary prize. The award was established by the 1895 will and estate of Swedish chemist and inventor [[Alfred Nobel]]. It was first awarded in [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Physics]], [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Chemistry]], [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]], [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Literature]], and [[Nobel Peace Prize|Peace]] in 1901. An associated prize, [[The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]], was instituted by [[Sveriges Riksbank|Sweden's central bank]] in 1968 and first awarded in 1969.

The Nobel Prizes in the above specific sciences disciplines and the Prize in Economics, which is commonly identified with them, are widely regarded as the most prestigious award one can receive in those fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/416856/Nobel-Prize|title=Nobel Prize|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="All Nobel Laureates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/all/|title=All Nobel Laureates|publisher=Nobel Foundation|accessdate=19 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of Japanese winners, eleven have been physicists, eight chemists, three for literature, five for physiology or medicine and one for efforts towards peace.&lt;ref name="All Nobel Laureates" /&gt;

In the 21st century, in the field of natural science, the number of Japanese winners of the Nobel Prize has been second behind the U.S.

:[[Shoichi Sakata]] reported the "Sakata model" - a model of [[hadrons]] in 1956, that inspired [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[George Zweig]]'s [[quark model]]. Moreover, [[Kazuhiko Nishijima]] and [[:ja:中野董夫|Tadao Nakano]] originally given the [[Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;

Afterward, [[Ivar Waller]], the member of [[Nobel Committee for Physics]] was sorry that Sakata had not received a physics prize.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Marc Friedman, ''The Politics of Excellence: Behind the Nobel Prize in Science.'' New York: Henry Holt &amp; Company (October 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Yoji Totsuka]] was leading the experiment that the first definitive evidence for [[neutrino oscillations]] was measured, via a high-statistics, high-precision measurement of the atmospheric neutrino flux. His Super-K group also confirmed, along with the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] (SNO), the solution to the [[solar neutrino problem]]. The Nobel Prize winning physicist [[Masatoshi Koshiba]] was told that if Totsuka could extend his lifespan by eighteen months, he would receive the physics prize.&lt;ref&gt;文藝春秋2008年9月号.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Chemistry
:[[Eiji Osawa]] prediction of the [[Fullerene|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; molecule]] at [[Hokkaido University]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Osawa|first = E. |year = 1970|journal = Kagaku |volume = 25|pages = 854–863|title=Superaromaticity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Halford|first = B. |date = 9 October 2006 |title = The World According to Rick |url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/84/8441cover.html |journal = [[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]

''Aromaticity''. Chemical Monograph Series 22. Kyoto: Kagaku-dojin. pp. 174–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, he was not awarded the 1996 chemistry prize.

:[[Seiji Shinkai]] invented the first [[molecular machine]] in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;Shinkai S, Ogawa T, Nakajima T, Kusano Y, Manabe 0 (1979) Tetrahedron Lett 20: 4569&lt;/ref&gt; but he was not awarded the 2016 chemistry prize. On the contrary, [[Ben Feringa]], one of the 2016 Nobel laureates, made a special trip to Japan in the 1980s to ask Shinkai for advice in the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://qbiz.jp/article/99637/1/ |title=九州に分子機械の先駆者　新海征治・九大特別主幹教授　今年のノーベル化学賞テーマ：ニュース：九州経済：qBiz 西日本新聞経済電子版 {{!}} 九州の経済情報サイト |access-date=15 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328091839/http://qbiz.jp/article/99637/1/ |archive-date=28 March 2019 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Physiology or Medicine
:[[Kitasato Shibasaburō]] and [[Emil von Behring]] working together in [[Berlin]] in 1890 announced the discovery of [[diphtheria]] [[antitoxin]] serum; Von Behring was awarded the 1901 prize because of this work, but Kitasato was not. Meanwhile, [[Hideyo Noguchi]]&lt;ref&gt;Japanese Government Internet TV "Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize," streaming video 2007/04/26&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sahachiro Hata]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=3941 Sachachiro Hata - Nomination Database]&lt;/ref&gt; those who missed out on the early Nobel Prize for many times.

:[[Katsusaburō Yamagiwa]] and his student [[:ja:市川厚一|Kōichi Ichikawa]] successfully induced [[squamous cell carcinoma]] by painting crude [[coal tar]] on the inner surface of rabbits' ears. Yamagiwa's work has become the primary basis for research of cause of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|quote=Yamagiwa, then Director of the Department of Pathology at Tokyo Imperial University Medical School, had theorized that repetition or continuation of chronic irritation caused precancerous alterations in previously normal epithelium. If the irritant continued its action, carcinoma could result. These data, publicly presented at a special meeting of the Tokyo Medical Society and reprinted below, focused attention on chemical carcinogenesis. Further more, his experimental method provided researchers with a means of producing cancer in the laboratory and anticipated investigation of specific carcinogenic agents and the precise way in which they acted. Within a decade, Keller and associates extracted a highly potent carcinogenic hydrocarbon from coal tar.

In 1966, the former committee member [[:sv:Folke Henschen|Folke Henschen]] claimed "I was strongly advocate Dr. Yamagiwa deserve the Nobel Prize, but unfortunate it did not realize".&lt;ref&gt;「『ガンの山極博士』たたえる」読売新聞1966年10月25日15頁。&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] 's guide to Nobel Prizes in cancer research mentions Yamagiwa's work as a milestone without mentioning Fibiger.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120323104136/http://www.britannica.com/nobelprize/article-224787 Guide to Nobel Prize].

''Tokyo Kagaku Kaishi'' 32: 4–7; 144–146; 335–358.&lt;/ref&gt; When the article was translated into German, the translation failed to state that it was a newly discovered nutrient, a claim made in the original Japanese article, and hence his discovery failed to gain publicity. Because of this, he was not awarded the 1929 medicine prize.

Ed., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mizutani was not awarded the 1975 medicine prize along with Temin.

:As of 2015, there have been seven Japanese who have received the [[Lasker Award]] and twelve Japanese who have received the [[Canada Gairdner International Award]], but only three Japanese who have received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].

;Others
:A number of important Japanese native scientists were not nominated for early Nobel Prizes, such as [[:ja:小島保彦|Yasuhiko Kojima]] and Yasuichi Nagano (jointly discovered [[Interferon]]), [[Takamine Jōkichi|Jōkichi Takamine]] (first isolated [[epinephrine]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Camille Georges Wermuth]]|title=The practice of medicinal chemistry|date=2008|publisher=Elsevier/Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780080568775|page=13|edition=3|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Qmt1_DQkCpEC&amp;pg=PA13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kiyoshi Shiga]] (discovered ''[[Shigella dysenteriae]]''), [[Tomisaku Kawasaki]] ([[Kawasaki disease]] is named after him), and [[Hakaru Hashimoto]]. After [[World War II]], [[Reiji Okazaki]] and his wife [[Tsuneko Okazaki|Tsuneko]] were known for describing the role of [[Okazaki fragments]], but he died of [[leukemia]] (sequelae of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]]) in 1975 at the age of 44.

:[[Masahiko Aoki]], seen as the most likely candidate to become the first Japanese to win the Nobel Prize for economics, for developing the Institutional Comparative Analysis, he taught at Kyoto University and Stanford University. Unfortunately, he passed away in Palo Alto, California, in July, 2015. He was 77.
