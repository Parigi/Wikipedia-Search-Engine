'''''Sojourner''''' is the [[Mars Pathfinder]] robotic [[Mars rover]] that landed on {{date|July 4, 1997|mdy}}&lt;ref name="NASA-Sojourner"&gt;{{cite web |last=Nelson |first=Jon |title=Mars Pathfinder / Sojourner Rover |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/details.php?id=5913 |date= |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Ares Vallis]] region, and explored Mars for around three months. It has front and rear cameras and hardware to conduct several scientific experiments. Designed for a mission lasting 7&amp;nbsp;[[Sol (day on Mars)|sols]], with possible extension to 30&amp;nbsp;sols,&lt;ref name=faq/&gt; it was in fact active for 83&amp;nbsp;sols (85 earth days). The base station had its last communication session with Earth at 3:23&amp;nbsp;a.m. Pacific Daylight Time on {{date|September 27, 1997|mdy}}.&lt;ref name="NASA-Sojourner" /&gt;&lt;ref name=sol86&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/ops/sol86.html|title=Mars Pathfinder - Mars - Sol 86 Images|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rover needed the base station to communicate with Earth, despite still functioning at the time communications ended.&lt;ref name=sol86/&gt;
''Sojourner'' traveled a distance of just over {{convert|100|m|ft|sp=us}} by the time communication was lost.&lt;ref name="Sojourner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spacepioneers.msu.edu/robot_rovers/sojourner.html|title=Sojourner|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320062255/http://spacepioneers.msu.edu/robot_rovers/sojourner.html|archivedate=2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was instructed to stay stationary until October 5, 1997 (sol 91) and then drive around the lander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/ops/sol89.html|title=Mars Pathfinder - Mars - Sol 89 Images|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Sojourner'' is the first wheeled vehicle to rove another planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/beyond-earth-tagged.pdf|title=Beyond Earth: A Chronicle of Deep Space Exploration, 1958–2016|page=2|last1=Siddiqi|first1=Asif A.|lccn=2017059404|isbn=9781626830424|publisher=NASA History Program Office|edition=second|year=2018|id=SP2018-4041|series=The NASA history series|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The name of the rover was selected in an essay contest won by Valerie Ambroise, a 12-year-old from U.S. state of [[Connecticut]]. It is named for abolitionist and women's rights activist [[Sojourner Truth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/14/nyregion/girl-who-named-mars-rover-stays-down-to-earth.html|title=Girl Who Named Mars Rover Stays Down to Earth|date=1997-07-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-01-24|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second-place prize went to Deepti Rohatgi, 18, of [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]], who proposed [[Marie Curie]], a Nobel Prize-winning Polish chemist. Third place went to Adam Sheedy, 16, of Round Rock, TX, who chose [[Judith Resnik]], a United States astronaut and shuttle crew-member.&lt;ref name="name"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/rover/name.html|title=Pathfinder Rover Gets Its Name|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rover was also known as ''Microrover Flight Experiment'' abbreviated MFEX.&lt;ref name="roll"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/martianchronicle/martianchron7/microrover.html|title=Mars Pathfinder Microrover Ready to Roll!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sojourner'' has solar panels and a non-rechargeable battery, which allowed limited nocturnal operations. Once the batteries were depleted, it could only operate during the day.&lt;ref name=faq/&gt; The batteries are lithium-thionyl chloride (LiSOCl2) and could provide 150 [[watt-hour]]s.&lt;ref name=soj&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/rover/descrip.html|title=Description of the Rover Sojourner|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The batteries also allowed the health of the rover to be checked while enclosed in the cruise stage while en route to Mars.&lt;ref name=power&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/roverpwr/power.html|title=Mars Pathfinder Microrover|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

0.22 square meters of solar cells could produce a maximum of about 15 watts on Mars, depending on conditions.&lt;ref name=soj/&gt; The cells were GaAs/Ge ([[Gallium arsenide germanium solar cell|Gallium Arsenide/Germanium]]) and capable of about 18 percent efficiency. They could survive down to about −140° Celsius (−220&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name=power/&gt;

Its [[central processing unit]] (CPU) is an [[Intel 80C85|80C85]] with a 2&amp;nbsp;MHz clock, addressing 64 Kbytes of memory. It has four memory stores; the previously mentioned 64 Kbytes of RAM (made by IBM) for the main processor, 16 Kbytes of radiation-hardened PROM (made by Harris), 176 Kbytes of non-volatile storage (made by [[Seeq Technology]]), and 512 Kbytes of temporary data storage (made by Micron). The electronics were housed inside the ''Warm Electronics Box'' inside the rover.&lt;ref name=faq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/rover/faqs_sojourner.html|title=Mars Pathfinder FAQs - Sojourner|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sojourner communicated with its base station using a 9,600 [[baud]] radio modem, although error-checking protocols limited communications to a functional data rate of 2,400 baud with a theoretical range of about half a kilometer. Under normal operation, it would periodically send a "[[Heartbeat (computing)|heartbeat]]" message to the lander. If no response was given, the rover could autonomously travel back to the location at which the last heartbeat was received. If desired, this same strategy could be used to deliberately extend the rover's operational range beyond that of its radio transceiver, although the rover rarely traveled further than 10 meters from Pathfinder during its mission.&lt;ref name=faq/&gt; 

The UHF radio modems worked similar to [[walkie-talkie]]s, but sent data, not voice. It could send or receive, but not both at same time, which is known as [[half-duplex]]. The data was communicated in bursts of 2 [[kilobyte]]s.&lt;ref name=radio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/rovercom/itworks.html#rover-radio|title=How the Mars Microrover Radios and Antennas Work|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) is nearly identical to the one on [[Mars 96]], and was a collaboration between the [[Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research]] in [[Lindau]], Germany (formally known as the Max Planck Institute For Aeronomy) and the [[University of Chicago]] in the United States. APXS could determine elemental composition of Mars rocks and dust, except for hydrogen. It works by exposing a sample to alpha particles, then measuring the energies of emitted protons, [[X-ray]]s, and [[backscatter]]ed alpha particles.&lt;ref name=nasa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/mpf/sci_desc.html|title=Mars Pathfinder Instrument Descriptions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rover had three cameras: two monochrome cameras in front, and a color camera in the rear. Each front camera had an array 484 pixels high by 768 wide. The optics consisted of a window, lens, and field flattener. The window was made of sapphire, while the lens objective and flattener were made of zinc selenide.&lt;ref name=ins&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdsimage.wr.usgs.gov/data/mpfr-m-apxs-2-edr-v1.0/mprv_0001/document/rcinst.htm|title=Rover Camera Instrument Description|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rover was imaged on Mars by the base station's IMP camera system, which also helped determine where the rover should go.&lt;ref name=roll/&gt;

''Sojourner'' operation was supported by "Rover Control Software", which ran on a [[SGI Onyx2|Silicon Graphics Onyx2]] computer back on Earth, and allowed command sequences to be generated using a graphical interface.&lt;ref name=mfex&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/MPF/roverctrlnav/rcw.html|title=MFEX Electronics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rover driver would wear 3D goggles supplied with imagery from the base station and move a virtual model with the spaceball controller, a specialized joystick. The control software allowed the rover and surrounding terrain to be viewed from any angle or position, supporting the study of terrain features, placing waypoints, or doing virtual flyovers.&lt;ref name=mfex/&gt;

The rover had a mass of 11.5&amp;nbsp;kg (weighing about 25 pounds on Earth), which equates to a weight of 4.5 [[kilogram-force|kgf]] (10 pounds) on Mars.&lt;ref name="Sojourner"/&gt;

== In popular culture ==
* In the 2000 film ''[[Red Planet (film)|Red Planet]]'', the crew of the first manned mission to Mars survives the crash-landing of their entry vehicle, but their communications equipment is destroyed so they cannot contact their recovery vehicle in orbit. To reestablish contact before being presumed dead and left behind by the pilot of their recovery vehicle, the crew goes to the site of the Pathfinder rover, from which they salvage parts to make a basic radio.&lt;ref&gt;Pfarrer, Chuck; Lemkin, Jonathan (2000).

* In the 2005 season 4 ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode "[[Terra Prime]]", ''Sojourner'' is briefly seen on the surface of Mars as a monument.
** ''Sojourner'' also features in ''Enterprises'''s opening sequence.
* In the 2011 novel ''[[The Martian (Andy Weir)|The Martian]]'' by Andy Weir, and [[The Martian (film)|the 2015 film based on it]], the protagonist Mark Watney, stranded on Mars, recovers the ''Pathfinder'' lander, and is able to use it to contact Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weir|first=Andy|title=[[The Martian (Andy Weir)|The Martian]]|year=2014|location=[[New York City|New York]]|publisher=[[Crown Publishers]]|isbn=978-0-8041-3902-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the movie, he is later seen in his [[Colonization of Mars|Mars outpost]], the Ares III Hab, with the ''Sojourner'' roving around.
