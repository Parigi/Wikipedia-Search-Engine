==Biography==
===Early life===
A'Lelia Walker was born Lelia McWilliams in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], in 1885, the daughter of Moses and [[Madam C. J. Walker|Sarah]] (née Breedlove) McWilliams. Her father died when she was 2. Her mother later married John Davis in 1894 and divorced in 1903. In 1906, her mother married Charles Joseph Walker, a newspaper advertising salesman, and became an independent hairdresser and retailer of cosmetic creams. A'Lelia grew up in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and attended [[Knoxville College]] in Tennessee before entering the family business.&lt;ref name="Her Own Ground 2001"&gt;A'Lelia Bundles, ''On Her Own Ground: The Life and Times of Madam C. J. Walker'', New York: Scribner (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
====Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company====
A'Lelia Walker became president of [[Madame C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company|her mother's company]] in 1919,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Martin|first=Douglas|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/14/nyregion/a-lelia-nelson-82-president-of-a-black-cosmetics-company.html|title=A'Lelia Nelson, 82, President Of a Black Cosmetics Company|date=2001-02-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-21|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and remained in that position until her death in August 1931. She initiated a number of marketing campaigns to promote the company—including a competition among prominent ministers for a Trip to the Holy Land in 1924—and remained the face of the Walker Company after her mother's death, but the day-to-day operation was overseen by Attorney F. B. Ransom and factory manager Alice Kelly at the [[Indianapolis]] headquarters. During the 1920s, A'Lelia Walker immersed herself in Harlem's dynamic social life as a patron of the arts and hostess of some of [[Harlem Renaissance|the era]]'s most notable social gatherings.&lt;ref name="Her Own Ground 2001"/&gt;

Walker Company sales began to suffer in 1929, with the beginning of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/09/22/436344078/remembering-alelia-walker-who-made-a-ritzy-space-for-harlems-queer-black-artists|title=Remembering A'Lelia Walker, Who Made A Ritzy Space For Harlem's Queer Black Artists|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased expenses associated with a new million dollar headquarters and manufacturing facility opened in late 1927 in Indianapolis, placed additional financial pressure on the operation, and she was forced to sell a great deal of her valuable art and antiques.&lt;ref name="Her Own Ground 2001" /&gt; Her adopted daughter Mae Walker was president of the company from 1931 until her death in 1945. Mae's daughter, A'Lelia Mae Perry Bundles (b. 1928– d. 1976),&lt;ref name="SSDI-AB"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; succeeded her mother as president of the company. Today the company's building is known as the [[Madame Walker Theatre Center|Madam Walker Theatre Center]] and is a [[National Historic Landmark]].

====Arts Patron====
A'Lelia Walker counted among her friends many accomplished African American musicians. She developed an early love of [[classical music]] and [[opera]] in part because the [[choir director]] at the AME church she and her mother attended in [[St. Louis]] was a classically trained opera singer and [[organist]]. She grew up in the neighborhood where [[Scott Joplin]] and other [[ragtime]] musicians gathered at Tom Turpin's Rosebud Cafe on [[Streets of St. Louis#Market Street|St. Louis's Market Street]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;.

During the 1920s she hosted many musicians, actors, writers, artists, political figures and socialites in her townhouse at 108-110 West 136th Street near [[Lenox Avenue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aleliabundles.com/2013/11/23/writing-biography-an-update-on-the-joy-goddess-of-harlem/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-12-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214060038/http://www.aleliabundles.com/2013/11/23/writing-biography-an-update-on-the-joy-goddess-of-harlem/ |archive-date=2013-12-14 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The elegant [[brick]] and [[limestone]] building had been designed by [[Vertner Tandy]], a founder of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity and the first black architect licensed in New York State. Almost from the time of her arrival in Harlem in 1913, her dinner parties, dances and [[Soirées|soirees]] included well known Harlem figures like [[James Reese Europe]], [[J. Rosamond Johnson|J. Rosamand Johnson]], [[Bert Williams]] and [[Florence Mills]]. Live music—from classical and ragtime to [[jazz]] and [[blues]]—was a regular feature with entertainment provided by her musician friends.

In October 1927, she converted a floor of the home into The Dark Tower, a cultural salon that became legendary as one of the gathering places of the era, a place where Harlem's talented artists socialized with their [[Greenwich Village]] counterparts as well as European and African royalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Big Sea: An Autobiography|last=Hughes|first=Langston|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1940|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She commissioned Austrian designer [[Paul Frankl]] to create the interior.  She also entertained at [[Villa Lewaro]], her country house in [[Westchester County]] and at her pied-à-terre at 80 Edgecombe Avenue in Harlem.

==Personal life==
Walker was married three times: to John Robinson, a hotel waiter,&lt;ref&gt;U. S. Census 1910&lt;/ref&gt; from whom she separated about 1911 and divorced in 1914; to Dr. Wiley Wilson in 1919; and to Dr. James Arthur Kennedy, in 1926, whom she divorced just a few months before her death in 1931.&lt;ref name=Aleilia/&gt; 

Her adoptive daughter was Fairy Mae Bryant, born in November 1898, who became an orphan and was adopted in 1912. She was known as '''Mae Walker''' and traveled with Madam C. J. Walker as a model and assistant. In November 1923, A'Lelia Walker orchestrated an elaborate "Million Dollar Wedding" (actually closer to $40,000) for Mae's marriage to Dr. Gordon Jackson.&lt;ref name=Aleilia&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aleliabundles.com/2011/12/01/my-grandmothers-harlem-renaissance-wedding/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-12-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214060656/http://www.aleliabundles.com/2011/12/01/my-grandmothers-harlem-renaissance-wedding/ |archive-date=2013-12-14 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mae, a graduate of [[Spelman College|Spelman Seminary]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], divorced Jackson in 1926 and married Attorney Marion R. Perry in September 1927.

==Death and legacy==
A'Lelia Walker died on August 17, 1931&lt;ref&gt;City of Long Branch Death Certificate&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] brought on by [[hypertension]], the same ailment that led to her mother's death in 1919. She was surrounded by friends who had traveled to [[Long Branch, New Jersey]] to celebrate a birthday party with [[lobster]] and [[champagne]] in the midst of the [[Great Depression]] and [[Prohibition]]. Thousands of Harlemites lined up to view her body. She was eulogized by Reverend [[Adam Clayton Powell Sr.]] at the funeral parlor on Seventh Avenue. [[Mary McLeod Bethune]] also spoke at the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/harlemrenaissanc0000unse_f3u5|title=Harlem Renaissance : art of Black America|date=1987|publisher=The Studio Museum in Harlem|others=Driskell, David C., Lewis, David Levering, 1936-, Willis, Deborah, 1948-, Studio Museum in Harlem.|isbn=0810910993|location=New York|oclc=13945412|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; As her casket was lowered into the ground next to her mother's grave at [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]]&lt;ref&gt;"Royalty and Blue-blooded Gentry Entertained by A'Lelia Walker at Lewaro and Townhouse, Amsterdam News, August 26, 1931, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; in the Bronx, [[Hubert Julian]] &amp;mdash;the celebrated "Black Eagle"&amp;mdash; flew over in a small plane and dropped [[Dahlia|dahlias]] and [[Gladiolus|gladioluses]] onto the site. 

[[Villa Lewaro]] was named for Walker ('''Le'''lia '''Wa'''lker '''Ro'''binson) after Italian tenor [[Enrico Caruso]] told her after a visit to the property that the newly built [[Irvington-on-Hudson, New York|Irvington-on-Hudson]] mansion reminded him of the houses of his native country. Actress and comedian [[Tiffany Haddish]] portrayed Walker in the [[Netflix]] miniseries ''[[Self Made (miniseries)|Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C. J. Walker]]'' which premiered on March 20, 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/tv-movies/a31247123/alelia-walker-self-made-true-story/|title="Self Made" Presents A'Lelia Walker as Queer—but That's Not Entirely Accurate|last=Nicolaou|first=Elena|date=2020-03-20|website=Oprah Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/opinions/netflix-self-made-madam-cj-walker-jones/index.html|title=This new Netflix miniseries let me down, then made me think|last=Jones|first=Opinion by Roxanne|website=CNN|access-date=2020-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
===Madam Walker Urban Life Center===
The Madam C. J. Walker Company moved from the building in 1985 and the trustees of the Walker estate transferred the building to a non-profit group called the Madam Walker Urban Life Center.&lt;ref name="IndyStar"&gt;"[http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/history/black_history/walker_madame.html Madam C.J.

As of 2020, Its current president is Judith Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
