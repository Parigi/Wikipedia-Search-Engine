"'''Cabaret'''" is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter [[Justin Timberlake]] for his fourth studio album, ''[[The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2]]'' (2013). Featuring a [[Rapping|rap verse]] by Canadian rapper [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]], the song was written and produced by Timberlake, [[Timbaland|Timothy "Timbaland" Mosley]], [[Jerome "J-Roc" Harmon]] and Daniel Jones, with additional writing from [[James Fauntleroy]] and Drake. "Cabaret" is a [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Soul music|soul]] song which features beatboxing, handclapping, guitars and keyboards in its composition. Music critics noted its similarity to Timbaland's earlier works with singer [[Aaliyah]] and Timberlake's 2006 single "[[My Love (Justin Timberlake song)|My Love]]". Lyrically, it finds the singer comparing his love to a [[burlesque]] and features sexually oriented lyrics.

"Cabaret" received generally positive reviews from contemporary critics who praised Timbaland's production as well as Drake's rap verse on the song. As a result of the strong digital downloads following the release of the album, the track debuted on the charts in South Korea and the United States. It peaked at number 18 on the US [[R&amp;B Songs]] chart and number 50 on the South Korean [[Gaon Chart]], selling over 3,800 digital copies for the week in the latter country. Timberlake included "Cabaret" on the set list of his fourth worldwide concert tour entitled [[The 20/20 Experience World Tour]] (2013-2014).

[[File:Drake Bluesfest.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Drake (rapper)|Drake]]'s rap verse on the song received praise from music critics]]

"Cabaret" received generally positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. Even though giving mixed review to the album, Kellman of Allmusic called the song a "standout".&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; Anderson of ''Entertainment Weekly'' chose "Cabaret" as the best song on the album, labeling it a "slick drum orgy with a ferocious Drake cameo".&lt;ref name="entertainmentweekly"/&gt; Similarly, Julia Leconte of ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]'' selected the song as a top track on the album and stated that it has catchy hook and cheesy lyrics which only Timberlake can pull off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/music/story.cfm?content=194635|title=Justin Timberlake&amp;nbsp;— The 20/20 Experience 2 Of 2 (RCA)|work=[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]|last=Leconte|first=Julia|accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mesfin Fekadu of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' wrote that "the song is smooth and has an addictive hook".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/30/justin-timberlake-the-2020-experience-2-of-2_n_4017355.html|title=Justin Timberlake's 'The 20/20 Experience 2 of 2' Album Is Full Of Leftovers (Review)|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|last=Fekadu|first=Mesfin|date=September 30, 2013|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Meagher of ''[[Irish Independent]]'' labelled the song "highly potent" and noted that it features Timberlake's "typical heavy-hitting approach".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/music-review-john-meagher-justin-timberlake-2020-vision-29633309.html|title=Music Review: Justin Timberlake - 20/20 Vision|work=[[Irish Independent]]|last=Meagher|first=John|date=October 4, 2013|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Los Angeles Times'''s Wood praised Drake's verse and wrote that he "takes the sex talk to a level that Timberlake the boy-band veteran still can't".&lt;ref name="la times"/&gt; HitFix's Newman graded the song with a "B-" mark, and wrote that "Drake comes in for a rap that works perfectly with the song in their first collaboration".&lt;ref name="hitfix"/&gt; Dave Hanratty of [[Drowned in Sound]] stated that "Cabaret" feels "navel-gazing" as a result of Drake's braggadocios appearance and the mechanical input given by Timbaland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/17875/reviews/4146930?ticker|title=Album Review: Justin Timberlake&amp;nbsp;— The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2|publisher=[[Drowned in Sound]]|last=Hanratty|first=Dave|date=September 30, 2013|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Entertainmentwise]]'s Amy Gravelle stated that Drake is featured on the track to add substance and style and proves that he was the "hottest" rapper at the moment.&lt;ref name="entertainmentwise"/&gt; A reviewer of [[Capital (radio network)|Capital FM]] stated that the song proves why Drake was the rapper on everyone's lips and further described "Cabaret" as a smart team-up between the artists backed by Timbaland's classic beats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalfm.com/artists/justin-timberlake/news/new-album-the-2020-experience-album-review/|title=Justin Timberlake's 'The 20/20 Experience 2 Of 2' Track By Track Album Review|publisher=[[Capital (radio network)|Capital FM]]|date=September 29, 2013|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the negative side, Lanre Bakare of ''[[The Guardian]]'' criticized the rapper's verse calling it "predictably self-indulgent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/26/justin-timberlake-the-20-20-experience-part-2|title=Justin Timberlake: The 20/20 Experience Part 2&amp;nbsp;– review|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=Bakare|first=Lanre|date=September 26, 2013|accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'s Stacy-Ann Ellis noted that although Drake gives some "lover-boy swag" to the song, [[Jay-Z]] outperformed him with his verse on "Murder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/article/review-leftovers-struggle-hit-spot-justin-timberlakes-2020-experience-2-2|title=Review: Leftovers Struggle To Hit The Spot On Justin Timberlake's 'The 20/20 Experience&amp;nbsp;— 2 of 2'|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|last=Ellise|first=Stacy-Ann|date=September 30, 2013|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of ''The 20/20 Experience - 2 of 2'', Craig Manning of website [[AbsolutePunk]] wrote that even thought the song features "a rapidfire" rap verse by Drake, both "Cabaret" and the lead single, "[[Take Back the Night (song)|Take Back the Night]]", "feel somehow less impressive than a lot of the songs Timberlake was slinging last time around, if only because they don't add up to an 'experience' greater than the sum of their parts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=3454031|title=Justin Timberlake&amp;nbsp;— The 20/20 Experience 2 of 2|publisher=[[AbsolutePunk]]|last=Manning|first=Craig|date=September 30, 2013|accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brice Ezell of [[PopMatters]], "for whatever reason [the song] never gets off of the ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/175560-justin-timberlake-the-20-20-experience-2-of-2/|title=Justin Timberlake: The 20/20 Experience (2 of 2)|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|last=Ezell|first=Brice|date=September 30, 2013|accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lydia Jenkin of ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' opined that the song would be a lot of sexier without the overpowering bass pulses in its production and "some odd lyrics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=11133607|title=Album review: Justin Timberlake, The 20/20 Experience: 2 of 2|work=[[New Zealand Herald]]|last=Jenkins|first=Lydia|date=October 3, 2013|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adelle Platon from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' dubbed the song "frisky" and Drake's verse "fit for a nightclub rendezvous."&lt;ref name="BBAP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7633393/justin-timberlake-best-hip-hop-rb-collaborations|title=Justin Timberlake's 14 Best Hip-Hop/R&amp;B Collaborations|last=Platon|first=Adelle|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=December 27, 2016|accessdate=December 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; HotNewHipHop's Trevor Smith said "Cabaret" "it's a fitting addition to a solid catalogue that Timberlake has been developing since stepping foot in the game."&lt;ref name="HNHH"/&gt;
