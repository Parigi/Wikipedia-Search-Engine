In [[historiography]], '''ancient Rome''' is Roman civilization from the founding of the Italian city of [[Rome]] in the 8th century BC to the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century AD, encompassing the [[Roman Kingdom]] (753 BC–509 BC), [[Roman Republic]] (509 BC–27 BC) and [[Roman Empire]] (27 BC–476 AD) until the fall of the western empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Rome|title=ancient Rome {{!}} Facts, Maps, &amp; History|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=5 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[civilization|civilisation]] began as an [[Italic peoples|Italic]] settlement in the [[Roman Italy|Italian Peninsula]], traditionally dated to 753 BC, that grew into the city of Rome and which subsequently gave its name to the empire over which it ruled and to the widespread civilisation the empire developed. The Roman Empire expanded to become one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires]] in the [[Ancient history|ancient world]], still ruled from the city, with an estimated 50 to 90&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time)&lt;ref&gt;There are several different estimates for the population of the Roman Empire.

In its many centuries of existence, the Roman state evolved from an [[Roman Kingdom|elective monarchy]] to a [[direct democracy|democratic]] [[classical republic]] and then to an increasingly [[Autocracy|autocratic]] [[elective monarchy|semi-elective]] [[military dictatorship]] during the Empire. Through [[invasion|conquest]], [[cultural assimilation|cultural]], and [[language shift|linguistic]] [[Romanization (cultural)|assimilation]], at its height it controlled the [[North Africa during Antiquity|North African]] coast, [[Egypt]], [[Southern Europe]], and most of [[Western Europe]], the [[Balkans]], [[Crimea]] and much of the [[Middle East]], including [[Anatolia]], [[Levant]] and parts of [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Arabia]]. It is often grouped into [[classical antiquity]] together with [[ancient Greece]], and their similar cultures and societies are known as the [[Greco-Roman world]].

Ancient Roman civilisation has contributed to modern language, religion, society, technology, law, politics, government, warfare, art, literature, architecture and engineering. Rome professionalised and expanded its military and created a system of government called ''[[res publica]]'', the inspiration for modern [[republic]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bGxiE6jvzOcC|title=A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution|page=793|editor1-last=Furet|editor1-first=François|editor2-last=Ozouf|editor2-first=Mona|publisher=Harvard University Press|date=1989|isbn=978-0674177284}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RMDnAAAAIAAJ|title=Democratization in the South: The Jagged Wave|page=11|last1=Luckham|first1=Robin|last2=White|first2=Gordon|publisher=Manchester University Press|date=1996|isbn=978-0719049422}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zN7lgzjettgC|title=American Republicanism: Roman Ideology in the United States Constitution|page=90|last=Sellers|first=Mortimer N.|publisher=NYU Press|date=1994|isbn=978-0814780053}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the United States and France. It achieved impressive [[Roman technology|technological]] and [[Ancient Roman architecture|architectural]] feats, such as the construction of an extensive system of [[Roman aqueducts|aqueducts]] and [[Roman roads|roads]], as well as the construction of large monuments, palaces, and public facilities.

The [[Punic Wars]] with [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] were decisive in establishing Rome as a world power. In this series of wars, Rome gained control of the strategic islands of Corsica, Sardinia, and Sicily; took Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal); and [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|destroyed the city of Carthage]] in 146 BC, giving Rome supremacy in the Mediterranean. By the end of the Republic (27 BC), Rome had conquered the lands around the Mediterranean and beyond: its domain extended from the Atlantic to [[Arabia Petraea|Arabia]] and from the mouth of the [[Rhine]] to North Africa. The Roman Empire emerged with the end of the Republic and the dictatorship of [[Augustus Caesar|Augustus]]. Seven-hundred and twenty-one years of [[Roman–Persian Wars]] started in 92&amp;nbsp;BC with the first struggle against [[Roman-Parthian Wars|Parthia]]. It would become the longest conflict in human history, and have major lasting effects and consequences for both empires.

Under [[Trajan]], the Empire reached its territorial peak. It stretched from the entire [[Mediterranean Basin]] to the beaches of the [[North Sea]] in the north, to the shores of the [[Red Sea|Red]] and [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] Seas in the East. Republican [[Mos maiorum|mores and traditions]] started to decline during the imperial period, with civil wars becoming a prelude common to the rise of a new emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TsTAAAAYAAJ|title=The Greatness and Decline of Rome, Volume 2|page=215|last=Ferrero|first=Guglielmo|translator1-last=Zimmern|translator1-first=Sir Alfred Eckhard|translator2-last=Chaytor|translator2-first=Henry John|publisher=G.P.

==Founding myth==
{{Main|Founding of Rome}}
According to the [[founding myth]] of Rome, the [[founding of Rome|city was founded]] on 21 April 753&amp;nbsp;BC on the banks of the river [[Tiber]] in central Italy, by the twin brothers [[Romulus and Remus]], who descended from the [[Troy|Trojan]] prince [[Aeneas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adkins|first1=Lesley|last2=Adkins|first2=Roy|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome|page=3|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-512332-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who were grandsons of the Latin King [[Numitor]] of [[Alba Longa]]. King Numitor was deposed by his brother, [[Amulius]], while Numitor's daughter, [[Rhea Silvia]], gave birth to the twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cavazzi|first1=F.|title=The Founding of Rome|url=http://www.roman-empire.net/founding/found-index.html|website=Illustrated History of the Roman Empire|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=livy8 &gt;{{cite book|last1=Livius|first1=Titus (Livy)|translator-last1=Luce|translator-first1=T.J.|title=The Rise of Rome, Books 1–5|date=1998|publisher=Oxford World's Classics|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-282296-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/riseofromebookso00livy/page/8 8–11]|url=https://archive.org/details/riseofromebookso00livy/page/8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Rhea Silvia had been raped and impregnated by [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the Roman [[god of war]], the twins were considered [[demigod|half-divine]].

[[File:Capitoline she-wolf Musei Capitolini MC1181.jpg|thumb|left|According to legend, [[founding of Rome|Rome was founded]] in 753&amp;nbsp;BC by [[Romulus and Remus]], who were raised by a she-wolf]]
The new king, Amulius, feared Romulus and Remus would take back the throne, so he ordered them to be drowned.&lt;ref name=livy8 /&gt; A [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]] (or a shepherd's wife in some accounts) saved and raised them, and when they were old enough, they returned the throne of Alba Longa to Numitor.&lt;ref name="Caesarandchrist" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Durant|first1=Will|last2=Durant|first2=Ariel|title=The Story of Civilization – Volume III: Caesar and Christ|date=1944|publisher=Simon and Schuster, Inc.|isbn=978-1567310238|pages=12–14|title-link=The Story of Civilization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=livy8 /&gt;

The twins then founded their own city, but Romulus killed Remus in a quarrel over the location of the [[Roman Kingdom]], though some sources state the quarrel was about who was going to rule or give his name to the city.&lt;ref&gt;Roggen, Hesse, Haastrup, Omnibus I, H. Aschehoug &amp; Co 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Romulus became the source of the city's name.&lt;ref name=livy8 /&gt; In order to attract people to the city, Rome became a sanctuary for the indigent, exiled, and unwanted. This caused a problem, in that Rome came to have a large male population but was bereft of women. Romulus visited neighboring towns and tribes and attempted to secure marriage rights, but as Rome was so full of undesirables he was refused. Legend says that the Latins invited the [[Sabine]]s to a festival and [[The Rape of the Sabine Women|stole their unmarried maidens]], leading to the integration of the Latins with the Sabines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ancienthistory.about.com/cs/grecoromanmyth1/a/mythslegends_3.htm Myths and Legends- Rome, the Wolf, and Mars]. Retrieved 8 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another legend, recorded by Greek historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], says that Prince Aeneas led a group of Trojans on a sea voyage to found a new Troy, since the original was destroyed at the end of the [[Trojan War]]. After a long time in rough seas, they landed on the banks of the [[Tiber River]]. Not long after they landed, the men wanted to take to the sea again, but the women who were traveling with them did not want to leave. One woman, named Roma, suggested that the women burn the ships out at sea to prevent their leaving. At first, the men were angry with Roma, but they soon realized that they were in the ideal place to settle. They named the settlement after the woman who torched their ships.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, Ronald and McGee Marni, ''The Ancient Roman World'' p. 15 (Cited 15 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman poet [[Virgil]] recounted this legend in his classical epic poem the ''[[Aeneid]]'', where the Trojan prince [[Aeneas]] is destined by the gods to found a new Troy. In the epic, the women also refuse to go back to the sea, but they were not left on the Tiber. After reaching Italy, Aeneas, who wanted to marry [[Lavinia]], was forced to wage war with her former suitor, [[Turnus]]. According to the poem, the [[Latin kings of Alba Longa|Alban kings]] were descended from Aeneas, and thus Romulus, the founder of Rome, was his descendant.

The city of Rome grew from settlements around a ford on the river [[Tiber]], a crossroads of traffic and trade.&lt;ref name="Caesarandchrist" /&gt; According to [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence, the village of Rome was probably founded some time in the 8th century BC, though it may go back as far as the 10th century BC, by members of the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin tribe]] of Italy, on the top of the [[Palatine Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matyszak|first1=Philip|title=Chronicle of the Roman Republic|date=2003|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-05121-4|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duiker|first1=William|last2=Spielvogel|first2=Jackson|title=World History|date=2001|publisher=Wadsworth|isbn=978-0-534-57168-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/worldhistoryto1500duik/page/129 129]|edition=Third|url=https://archive.org/details/worldhistoryto1500duik/page/129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], who had previously settled to the north in [[Etruria]], seem to have established political control in the region by the late 7th century BC, forming an aristocratic and monarchical elite. The Etruscans apparently lost power by the late 6th century BC, and at this point, the original Latin and Sabine tribes reinvented their government by creating a republic, with much greater restraints on the ability of rulers to exercise power.&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Rome and the Roman Empire'' by Michael Kerrigan. [[Dorling Kindersley]], London: 2001. {{ISBN|0-7894-8153-7}}. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman tradition and archaeological evidence point to a complex within the [[Roman Forum|Forum Romanum]] as the seat of power for the king and the beginnings of the religious center there as well. [[Numa Pompilius]] the second [[king of Rome]], succeeding [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]], began Rome's building projects with his royal palace the [[Regia]] and the complex of the [[Vestal Virgin|Vestal virgins]].

In the 3rd century BC Rome faced a new and formidable opponent: [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]]. Carthage was a rich, flourishing [[Phoenicia]]n [[city-state]] that intended to dominate the Mediterranean area. The two cities were allies in the times of Pyrrhus, who was a menace to both, but with Rome's hegemony in mainland Italy and the Carthaginian [[thalassocracy]], these cities became the two major powers in the Western Mediterranean and their contention over the Mediterranean led to conflict.

The [[First Punic War]] began in 264&amp;nbsp;BC, when the city of [[Messina|Messana]] asked for Carthage's help in their conflicts with [[Hiero II of Syracuse]]. After the Carthaginian intercession, Messana asked Rome to expel the Carthaginians. Rome entered this war because [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] and Messana were too close to the newly conquered Greek cities of Southern Italy and Carthage was now able to make an offensive through Roman territory; along with this, Rome could extend its domain over [[Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/11*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', XI, XLIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Romans had experience in land battles, defeating this new enemy required naval battles. Carthage was a maritime power, and the Roman lack of ships and naval experience made the path to the victory a long and difficult one for the [[Roman Republic]]. Despite this, after more than 20 years of war, Rome defeated Carthage and a peace treaty was signed. Among the reasons for the [[Second Punic War]]&lt;ref&gt;New historical atlas and general history By Robert Henlopen Labberton. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; was the subsequent war reparations Carthage acquiesced to at the end of the First Punic War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh Chisholm|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=imzQwjVwxXYC&amp;pg=PA652|year=1911|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Company|page=652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Second Punic War is famous for its brilliant generals: on the Punic side [[Hannibal]] and [[Hasdrubal (Barcid)|Hasdrubal]]; on the Roman, [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]], [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus]] and [[Scipio Africanus|Publius Cornelius Scipio]]. Rome fought this war simultaneously with the [[First Macedonian War]]. The war began with the audacious invasion of Hispania by Hannibal, the Carthaginian general who had led operations on Sicily in the First Punic War. Hannibal, son of [[Hamilcar Barca]], rapidly marched through [[Hispania]] to the Italian [[Alps]], causing panic among Rome's Italian allies. The best way found to defeat Hannibal's purpose of causing the Italians to abandon Rome was to delay the Carthaginians with a [[guerrilla]] war of attrition, a strategy propounded by Quintus Fabius Maximus, who would be nicknamed ''Cunctator'' ("delayer" in Latin), and whose strategy would be forever after known as [[Fabian strategy|Fabian]]. Due to this, Hannibal's goal was unachieved: he could not bring enough Italian cities to revolt against Rome and replenish his diminishing army, and he thus lacked the machines and manpower to besiege Rome.

Still, Hannibal's invasion lasted over 16 years, ravaging Italy. Finally, when the Romans perceived the depletion of Hannibal's supplies, they sent Scipio, who had defeated Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal in modern-day Spain, to invade the unprotected Carthaginian hinterland and force Hannibal to return to defend Carthage itself. The result was the ending of the Second Punic War by the famously decisive [[Battle of Zama]] in October 202&amp;nbsp;BC, which gave to Scipio his [[agnomen]] ''Africanus''. At great cost, Rome had made significant gains: the conquest of Hispania by Scipio, and of Syracuse, the last Greek realm in Sicily, by Marcellus.

More than a half century after these events, Carthage was humiliated and Rome was no more concerned about the African menace. The Republic's focus now was only to the [[Hellenistic]] kingdoms of Greece and [[Celtiberian Wars|revolts in Hispania]]. However, Carthage, after having paid the war indemnity, felt that its commitments and submission to Rome had ceased, a vision not shared by the [[Roman Senate]]. When in 151&amp;nbsp;BC [[Numidia]] invaded Carthage, Carthage asked for Roman intercession. Ambassadors were sent to Carthage, among them was [[Cato the Elder|Marcus Porcius Cato]], who after seeing that Carthage could make a comeback and regain its importance, ended all his speeches, no matter what the subject was, by saying: "''[[Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam]]''" ("Furthermore, I think that Carthage must be destroyed").

As Carthage fought with Numidia without Roman consent, the [[Third Punic War]] began when Rome declared war against Carthage in 149&amp;nbsp;BC. Carthage resisted well at the first strike, with the participation of all the inhabitants of the city. However, Carthage could not withstand the attack of [[Scipio Aemilianus]], who entirely destroyed the city and its walls, enslaved and sold all the citizens and gained control of that region, which became the province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]]. Thus ended the Punic War period. All these wars resulted in Rome's first overseas conquests (Sicily, Hispania and Africa) and the rise of Rome as a significant imperial power and began the end of democracy.

Violent gangs of the urban unemployed, controlled by rival Senators, intimidated the electorate through violence. The situation came to a head in the late 2nd century BC under the [[Gracchi]] brothers, a pair of [[tribune]]s who attempted to pass land reform legislation that would redistribute the major patrician landholdings among the plebeians. Both brothers were killed and the Senate passed reforms reversing the Gracchi brother's actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmZHKOHgvFQC|title=Twenty-six Centuries of Agrarian Reform: A Comparative Analysis|page=34|last=Tuma|first=Elias H.|publisher=University of California Press|date=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the growing divide of the plebeian groups ([[populares]]) and equestrian classes ([[optimates]]).

=== Marius and Sulla ===
[[Gaius Marius]], a ''[[novus homo]]'', who started his political career with the help of the powerful [[Metelli]] family soon become a leader of the Republic, holding the first of his seven consulships (an unprecedented number) in 107&amp;nbsp;BC by arguing that his former patron [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus]] was not able to defeat and capture the Numidian king [[Jugurtha]]. Marius then started his military reform: in his recruitment to fight Jugurtha, he levied the very poor (an innovation), and many landless men entered the army; this was the seed of securing loyalty of the army to the General in command.

[[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] was born into a poor family that used to be a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] family. He had a good education but became poor when his father died and left none of his will. Sulla joined the theater and found many friends there, prior to becoming a general in the [[Jugurthine War|Jugurthine war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Plutarch|first=|title=Life of Sulla|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, Marius began his quarrel with Sulla: Marius, who wanted to capture Jugurtha, asked [[Bocchus I|Bocchus]], son-in-law of Jugurtha, to hand him over. As Marius failed, Sulla, a [[Legatus|general]] of Marius at that time, in a dangerous enterprise, went himself to Bocchus and convinced Bocchus to hand Jugurtha over to him. This was very provocative to Marius, since many of his enemies were encouraging Sulla to oppose Marius. Despite this, Marius was elected for five consecutive consulships from 104 to 100&amp;nbsp;BC, as Rome needed a military leader to defeat the [[Cimbri]] and the [[Teutones]], who were threatening Rome.

[[File:Sulla Glyptothek Munich 309.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]]]
After Marius's retirement, Rome had a brief peace, during which the Italian ''socii'' ("allies" in Latin) requested Roman citizenship and voting rights. The reformist [[Marcus Livius Drusus (tribune)|Marcus Livius Drusus]] supported their legal process but was assassinated, and the ''socii'' revolted against the Romans in the [[Social War (91-88&amp;nbsp;BC)|Social War]]. At one point both consuls were killed; Marius was appointed to command the army together with [[Lucius Julius Caesar (consul 90&amp;nbsp;BC)|Lucius Julius Caesar]] and Sulla.&lt;ref name="WHdP-EBp760"/&gt;

By the end of the Social War, Marius and Sulla were the premier military men in Rome and their partisans were in conflict, both sides jostling for power. In 88&amp;nbsp;BC, Sulla was elected for his first consulship and his first assignment was to defeat [[Mithridates VI]] of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], whose intentions were to conquer the Eastern part of the Roman territories. However, Marius's partisans managed his installation to the military command, defying Sulla and the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], and this caused Sulla's wrath. To consolidate his own power, Sulla conducted a surprising and illegal action: [[Sulla's first civil war|he marched to Rome]] with his legions, killing all those who showed support to Marius's cause and impaling their heads in the [[Roman Forum]]. In the following year, 87&amp;nbsp;BC, Marius, who had fled at Sulla's march, returned to Rome while Sulla was campaigning in Greece. He seized power along with the consul [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]] and killed the other consul, [[Gnaeus Octavius (consul 87 BC)|Gnaeus Octavius]], achieving his seventh consulship. In an attempt to raise Sulla's anger, Marius and Cinna revenged their partisans by conducting a massacre.&lt;ref name="WHdP-EBp760"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Harrison De Puy|title=The Encyclopædia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, and general literature; the R.S.

Marius died in 86&amp;nbsp;BC, due to age and poor health, just a few months after seizing power. Cinna exercised absolute power until his death in 84&amp;nbsp;BC. Sulla after returning from his Eastern campaigns, had a free path to reestablish his own power. In 83&amp;nbsp;BC he made his [[Sulla's second civil war|second march in Rome]] and began a time of terror: thousands of nobles, knights and senators were executed. Sulla also held two [[Roman dictator|dictatorships]] and one more consulship, which began the crisis and decline of Roman Republic.&lt;ref name="WHdP-EBp760"/&gt;

===Caesar and the First Triumvirate===
{{more citations needed section|date=September 2014}}
[[File:Landing of the Romans on the Coast of Kent.jpg|thumb|Landing of the Romans in [[Kent]], 55 BC: Caesar with 100 ships and two legions made an opposed landing, probably near [[Deal, Kent|Deal]]. After pressing a little way inland against fierce opposition and losing ships in a storm, he retired back across the [[English Channel]] to Gaul from what was a reconnaissance in force, only to return the following year for a more serious [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invasion]].]]

In the mid-1st century BC, Roman politics were restless. Political divisions in Rome became identified with two groupings, ''[[populares]]'' (who hoped for the support of the people) and ''[[optimates]]'' (the "best", who wanted to maintain exclusive aristocratic control). Sulla overthrew all populist leaders and his constitutional reforms removed powers (such as those of the [[tribune of the plebs]]) that had supported populist approaches. Meanwhile, social and economic stresses continued to build; Rome had become a metropolis with a super-rich aristocracy, debt-ridden aspirants, and a large proletariat often of impoverished farmers. The latter groups supported the [[Catiline|Catilinarian conspiracy]]—a resounding failure, since the consul [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]] quickly arrested and executed the main leaders of the conspiracy.

Onto this turbulent scene emerged [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]], from an aristocratic family of limited wealth. [[Julia (wife of Marius)|His aunt Julia]] was Marius' wife,&lt;ref name=Plutarch&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html Plutarch Parallel Lives], ''Life of Caesar'', I,2&lt;/ref&gt; and Caesar identified with the populares. To achieve power, Caesar reconciled the two most powerful men in Rome: [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], who had financed much of his earlier career, and Crassus' rival, [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] (anglicized as Pompey), to whom he married [[Julia (daughter of Julius Caesar)|his daughter]]. He formed them into a new informal alliance including himself, the [[First Triumvirate]] ("three men"). This satisfied the interests of all three: Crassus, the richest man in Rome, became richer and ultimately achieved high military command; Pompey exerted more influence in the Senate; and Caesar obtained the consulship and military command in [[Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scullard|first1=Howard Hayes|title=From the Gracchi to Nero|date=1982|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-02527-0|edition=5th|url=https://archive.org/details/fromgracchitoner00scul}} Chapters VI–VIII.&lt;/ref&gt; So long as they could agree, the three were in effect the rulers of Rome.

In 54&amp;nbsp;BC, Caesar's daughter, Pompey's wife, died in childbirth, unraveling one link in the alliance. In 53&amp;nbsp;BC, Crassus invaded [[Parthia]] and was killed in the [[Battle of Carrhae]]. The Triumvirate disintegrated at Crassus' death. Crassus had acted as mediator between Caesar and Pompey, and, without him, the two generals manoeuvred against each other for power. Caesar [[Gallic Wars|conquered Gaul]], obtaining immense wealth, respect in Rome and the loyalty of battle-hardened legions. He also became a clear menace to Pompey and was loathed by many ''optimates''. Confident that Caesar could be stopped by legal means, Pompey's party tried to strip Caesar of his legions, a prelude to Caesar's trial, impoverishment, and exile.

To avoid this fate, Caesar [[Caesar's Civil War|crossed the Rubicon]] River and invaded Rome in 49&amp;nbsp;BC. Pompey and his party fled from Italy, pursued by Caesar. The [[Battle of Pharsalus]] was a brilliant victory for Caesar and in this and other campaigns he destroyed all of the ''optimates''' leaders: [[Metellus Scipio]], [[Cato the Younger]], and Pompey's son, [[Gnaeus Pompeius (son of Pompey the Great)|Gnaeus Pompeius]]. Pompey was murdered in Egypt in 48&amp;nbsp;BC. Caesar was now pre-eminent over Rome, attracting the bitter enmity of many aristocrats. He was granted many offices and honours. In just five years, he held four consulships, two ordinary dictatorships, and two special dictatorships: one for ten years and another for perpetuity. He was murdered in 44&amp;nbsp;BC, on the [[Ides of March]] by the ''[[Liberatores]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/caesar_julius.shtml Julius Caesar (100–44 BC)]. BBC.

Caesar's assassination caused political and social turmoil in Rome; without the dictator's leadership, the city was ruled by his friend and colleague, [[Mark Antony|Marcus Antonius]]. Soon afterward, [[Augustus|Octavius]], whom Caesar adopted through his will, arrived in Rome. Octavian (historians regard Octavius as Octavian due to the [[Roman naming conventions]]) tried to align himself with the Caesarian faction.

The Triumvirate divided the Empire among the triumvirs: Lepidus was given charge of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], Antony, the eastern provinces, and Octavian remained in [[Italy (Roman Empire)|Italia]] and controlled [[Hispania]] and [[Gaul]]. The Second Triumvirate expired in 38&amp;nbsp;BC but was renewed for five more years. However, the relationship between Octavian and Antony had deteriorated, and Lepidus was forced to retire in 36&amp;nbsp;BC after betraying Octavian in [[Sicilian revolt|Sicily]]. By the end of the Triumvirate, Antony was living in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], an independent and rich kingdom ruled by Antony's lover, [[Cleopatra VII]]. Antony's affair with Cleopatra was seen as an act of treason, since she was queen of another country. Additionally, Antony adopted a lifestyle considered too extravagant and [[Hellenistic]] for a Roman statesman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Antony*.html#ref57] Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives'', ''Life of Antony'', LXXI, 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Antony's [[Donations of Alexandria]], which [[Reign of Cleopatra VII|gave to Cleopatra]] the title of "[[Queen of Kings]]", and to Antony's and Cleopatra's children the regal titles to the newly conquered Eastern territories, [[Final War of the Roman Republic|war between Octavian and Antony broke out]]. Octavian annihilated Egyptian forces in the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31&amp;nbsp;BC. [[Death of Cleopatra|Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide]]. Now Egypt was conquered by the Roman Empire, and for the Romans, a new era had begun.

==Empire – the Principate==
{{Main|Roman Empire}}
In 27&amp;nbsp;BC and at the age of 36, Octavian was the sole Roman leader. In that year, he took the name ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]''. That event is usually taken by historians as the beginning of Roman Empire—although Rome was an "imperial" state since 146&amp;nbsp;BC, when Carthage was razed by [[Scipio Aemilianus]] and Greece was conquered by [[Lucius Mummius]]. Officially, the government was republican, but Augustus assumed absolute powers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/augustus.shtml Augustus (63 BC – AD 14)] from [[BBC Online|bbc.co.uk]].

===Julio-Claudian dynasty===
The [[Julio-Claudian]] dynasty was established by Augustus. The emperors of this dynasty were: [[Augustus]], [[Tiberius]], [[Caligula]], [[Claudius]] and [[Nero]]. The dynasty is so-called due to the ''[[gens Julia]]'', family of Augustus, and the ''[[gens Claudia]]'', family of Tiberius. The Julio-Claudians started the destruction of republican values, but on the other hand, they boosted Rome's status as the central power in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jucl/hd_jucl.htm The Julio-Claudian Dynasty (27 BC – 68 AD)]. by the Department of Greek and [[Roman art|Roman Art]], The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

====Augustus====
[[File:Statue-Augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Augustus of Prima Porta]], 1st century AD, depicting [[Augustus]], the first [[Roman emperor]]]]
[[Augustus]] gathered almost all the republican powers under his official title, ''[[princeps]]'': he had powers of consul, ''[[princeps senatus]]'', [[aedile]], [[Roman censor|censor]] and [[tribune]]—including tribunician sacrosanctity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Augustus'', XXVII, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the base of an emperor's power. Augustus also styled himself as ''[[Imperator]] Gaius Julius Caesar divi filius'', "Commander Gaius Julius Caesar, son of the deified one". With this title he not only boasted his familial link to deified Julius Caesar, but the use of ''Imperator'' signified a permanent link to the Roman tradition of victory.

He also diminished the [[Roman Senate|Senatorial class]] influence in politics by boosting the [[equestrian class]]. The senators lost their right to rule certain provinces, like Egypt; since the governor of that province was directly nominated by the emperor. The creation of the [[Praetorian Guard]] and his reforms in the military, creating a [[standing army]] with a fixed size of 28 legions, ensured his total control over the army.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Eck, ''The Age of Augustus''&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with the Second Triumvirate's epoch, Augustus' reign as ''princeps'' was very peaceful. This peace and richness (that was granted by the agrarian province of Egypt)&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Augustus'', XVIII, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; led the people and the nobles of Rome to support Augustus increasing his strength in political affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh Chisholm|title=Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vPktAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA912|year=1910|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Company|page=912}}&lt;/ref&gt; In military activity, Augustus was absent at battles. His generals were responsible for the field command; gaining such commanders as [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]], [[Nero Claudius Drusus]] and [[Germanicus]] much respect from the populace and the legions. Augustus intended to extend the Roman Empire to the whole known world, and in his reign, Rome conquered [[Cantabrian Wars|Cantabria]], [[Aquitania]], [[Raetia]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] and [[Pannonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Augustus'', XXI, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Augustus's reign, Roman literature grew steadily in what is known as the [[Golden Age of Latin Literature]]. Poets like [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]] and [[Lucius Varius Rufus|Rufus]] developed a rich literature, and were close friends of Augustus. Along with [[Maecenas]], he stimulated patriotic poems, as Virgil's epic ''[[Aeneid]]'' and also historiographical works, like those of [[Livy]]. The works of this literary age lasted through Roman times, and are classics. Augustus also continued the shifts on the calendar promoted by [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], and the month of August is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Augustus'', XXI.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus brought a peaceful and thriving era to Rome, known as ''[[Pax Romana|Pax Augusta]]'' or ''Pax Romana''. Augustus died in 14&amp;nbsp;AD, but the empire's glory continued after his era.

Influenced by his wife, [[Livia Drusilla]], Augustus appointed her son from another marriage, [[Tiberius]], as his heir.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Augustus'', LXIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate agreed with the succession, and granted to Tiberius the same titles and honors once granted to Augustus: the title of ''princeps'' and ''[[Pater patriae]]'', and the [[Civic Crown]]. However, Tiberius was not an enthusiast of political affairs: after agreement with the Senate, he retired to [[Capri]] in 26&amp;nbsp;AD,&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/57*.html#ref4] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LVII, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and left control of the city of Rome in the hands of the [[praetorian prefect]] [[Sejanus]] (until 31&amp;nbsp;AD) and [[Naevius Sutorius Macro|Macro]] (from 31 to 37&amp;nbsp;AD). Tiberius was regarded as an evil and melancholic man, who may have ordered the murder of his relatives, the popular general [[Germanicus]] in 19&amp;nbsp;AD,&lt;ref name=tarver1902&gt;{{cite book|author=John Charles Tarver|title=Tiberius, the tyrant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3MHPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA342|accessdate=31 May 2012|year=1902|publisher=A.

Tiberius died (or was killed)&lt;ref name=tarver1902/&gt; in 37&amp;nbsp;AD. The male line of the Julio-Claudians was limited to Tiberius' nephew [[Claudius]], his grandson [[Tiberius Gemellus]] and his grand-nephew [[Caligula]].

===Flavian dynasty===

The Flavians were the second dynasty to rule Rome.&lt;ref name=suetonius&gt;Suetonius&lt;/ref&gt; By 68&amp;nbsp;AD, year of Nero's death, there was no chance of return to the old and traditional [[Roman Republic]], thus a new emperor had to rise.

Under the Flavians, Rome continued its expansion, and the state remained secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Connell|first1=Robert|title=Of Arms and Men: A History of War, Weapons, and Aggression|url=https://archive.org/details/ofarmsmenhisto00ocon|url-access=registration|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-505359-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/ofarmsmenhisto00ocon/page/81 81]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kreis|first1=Stephen|title=Augustus Caesar and the Pax Romana|url=http://www.historyguide.org/ancient/lecture12b.html|website=The History Guide|accessdate=21 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant [[Campaign history of the Roman military|military campaign]] undertaken during the Flavian period, was the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|siege and destruction]] of [[Jerusalem]] in 70 by [[Titus]]. The destruction of the city was the culmination of the Roman campaign in [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] following the Jewish uprising of 66. The Second Temple was completely demolished, after which Titus's soldiers proclaimed him ''[[imperator]]'' in honor of the victory. Jerusalem was sacked and much of the population killed or dispersed. [[Josephus]] claims that 1,100,000 people were killed during the siege, of which a majority were Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, The Wars of the Jews VI.9.3&lt;/ref&gt; 97,000 were captured and [[Slavery in ancient Rome|enslaved]], including [[Simon bar Giora]] and [[John of Giscala]]. Many fled to areas around the Mediterranean. Titus reportedly refused to accept a wreath of victory, as there is "no merit in vanquishing people forsaken by their own God".

====Vespasian====
Vespasian was a general under [[Claudius]] and [[Nero]]. He fought as a commander in the [[First Jewish-Roman War]] along with his son [[Titus]]. Following the turmoil of the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], in 69&amp;nbsp;AD, four emperors were enthroned: [[Galba]], [[Otho]], [[Vitellius]], and, lastly, Vespasian, who crushed Vitellius' forces and became emperor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Vespasian'', I.&lt;/ref&gt; He reconstructed many buildings which were uncompleted, like a statue of [[Apollo]] and the temple of ''[[Claudius|Divus Claudius]]'' ("the deified Claudius"), both initiated by Nero. Buildings once destroyed by the [[Great Fire of Rome]] were rebuilt, and he revitalized the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitol]]. Vespasian also started the construction of the Flavian Amphitheater, more commonly known as the [[Colosseum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Vespasian'', IX.&lt;/ref&gt; The historians [[Josephus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote their works during Vespasian's reign. Vespasian was Josephus' sponsor and Pliny dedicated his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' to Titus, son of Vespasian. Vespasian sent legions to defend the eastern frontier in [[Cappadocia]], extended the occupation in Britannia (modern-day [[England]], Wales and southern [[Scotland]]) and reformed the tax system. He died in 79&amp;nbsp;AD.

====Titus and Domitian====
Titus had a short-lived rule; he was emperor from 79–81&amp;nbsp;AD. He finished the Flavian Amphitheater, which was constructed with war spoils from the First Jewish-Roman War, and promoted games celebrating the victory over the Jews that lasted for a hundred days. These games included [[Gladiator|gladiatorial combats]], [[chariot race]]s and a sensational mock naval battle on the flooded grounds of the Colosseum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#ref7] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXVI.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#ref9] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Titus'', VII, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Titus died of fever in 81&amp;nbsp;AD, and was succeeded by his brother [[Domitian]].

Domitian ruled for fifteen years, and his reign was marked by his attempts to compare himself to the gods. He constructed at least two temples in honour of Jupiter, the supreme deity in [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]. He also liked to be called "''Dominus et Deus''" ("Master and God").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-empire.net/emperors/domitian-index.html Titus Flavius Domitianus].

===Nerva–Antonine dynasty===
[[File:RomanEmpireTrajan117AD.png|thumb|The [[Roman Empire]] reached its greatest extent under [[Trajan]] in AD&amp;nbsp;117]]
The Nerva–Antonine dynasty from 96 AD to 192 AD was the rule of the emperors Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius, Lucius Verus, and Commodus. During their rule, Rome reached its territorial and economical apogee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unrv.com/early-empire/five-good-emperors.php Five Good Emperors] from UNRV History. Retrieved 12 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a time of peace for Rome. The criteria for choosing an emperor were the qualities of the candidate and no longer ties of kinship; additionally, there were no civil wars or military defeats in this period. Following Domitian's murder, the Senate rapidly appointed [[Nerva]] to hold imperial dignity. This was the first time that senators chose the emperor since Octavian was honored with the titles of ''[[princeps]]'' and ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]''. Nerva had a noble ancestry, and he had served as an advisor to [[Nero]] and the Flavians. His rule restored many of the liberties once assumed by Domitian&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXVIII, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and started the last golden era of Rome.

====Trajan====
[[File:Traiani iustitia.jpg|thumb|''The Justice of Trajan'' (fragment) by [[Eugène Delacroix]]]]
Nerva died in 98&amp;nbsp;AD and his successor and heir was the general [[Trajan]]. Trajan was born in a non-patrician family from [[Hispania Baetica]] (modern-day [[Andalusia]]) and his preeminence emerged in the army, under Domitian. He is the second of the [[Five Good Emperors]], the first being Nerva. Trajan was greeted by the people of Rome with enthusiasm, which he justified by governing well and without the bloodiness that had marked Domitian's reign. He freed many people who had been unjustly imprisoned by Domitian and returned private property that Domitian had confiscated; a process begun by Nerva before his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXVIII, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Trajan conquered Dacia]] (roughly modern-day [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]]), and defeated the king [[Decebalus]], who had [[Domitian's Dacian War|defeated Domitian's forces]]. In the [[First Dacian War]] (101–102), the defeated [[Dacia]] became a client kingdom; in the [[Second Dacian War]] (105–106), Trajan completely devastated the enemy's resistance and annexed Dacia to the Empire. Trajan also annexed the client state of [[Nabatea]] to form the province of [[Arabia Petraea]], which included the lands of southern Syria and northwestern Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXVIII, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; He erected many buildings that survive to this day, such as [[Trajan's Forum]], [[Trajan's Market]] and [[Trajan's Column]]. His main architect was [[Apollodorus of Damascus]]; Apollodorus made the project of the Forum and of the Column, and also reformed the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]. Trajan's triumphal arches in [[Ancona]] and [[Benevento|Beneventum]] are other constructions projected by him. In the Second Dacian War, Apollodorus made a [[Trajan's Bridge|great bridge over the Danube]] for Trajan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXVIII, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trajan's Parthian campaign|Trajan's final war]] was against [[Parthia]]. When Parthia appointed a king for [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] who was unacceptable to Rome (Parthia and Rome shared dominance over Armenia), he declared war. He probably wanted to be the first Roman leader to conquer Parthia, and repeat the glory of [[Alexander the Great]], conqueror of Asia, whom Trajan next followed in the clash of Greek-Romans and the Persian cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ferdinand Gregorovius|title=The Emperor Hadrian: A Picture of the Graeco-Roman World in His Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D20G5zMpPfUC&amp;pg=PA16|year=1898|publisher=Macmillan|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 113 he marched to Armenia and deposed the local king.

====From Hadrian to Commodus====
[[File:Hadrians Wall map.png|thumb|300px|Map showing the location of [[Hadrian's Wall]] and the [[Antonine Wall]] in Scotland and Northern England]]
Many Romans emigrated to Hispania (modern-day [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) and stayed for generations, in some cases intermarrying with [[Iberians]]; one of these families produced the emperor [[Hadrian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of European Peoples |date=2006 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |page=406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hadrian withdrew all the troops stationed in Parthia, Armenia and Mesopotamia (modern-day [[Iraq]]), abandoning Trajan's conquests. Hadrian's army crushed a revolt in [[Mauretania]] and the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in Judea. This was the last large-scale Jewish revolt against the Romans and was destroyed with massive repercussions in Judea. Hundreds of thousands of Jews were killed. Hadrian renamed the province of Judea "[[Syria Palaestina|Provincia Syria Palaestina]]," after one of Judea's most hated enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 4 |date=2005 |publisher=Wm.

A famous [[philhellenism|philhellenist]], Hadrian promoted culture, specially the Greek. He also forbade [[torture]] and humanized the laws. Hadrian built many aqueducts, baths, libraries and theaters; additionally, he traveled nearly every single province in the Empire to check the military and infrastructural conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Hadrian/1*.html] Historia Augusta, ''Life of Hadrian''.&lt;/ref&gt; After Hadrian's death in 138 AD, his successor [[Antoninus Pius]] built temples, theaters, and mausoleums, promoted the arts and sciences, and bestowed honours and financial rewards upon the teachers of [[rhetoric]] and philosophy. Antoninus made few initial changes when he became emperor, leaving intact as far as possible the arrangements instituted by Hadrian. Antoninus expanded Roman Britannia by invading what is now southern Scotland and building the [[Antonine Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Antoninus_Pius*.html#ref34] ''Historia Augusta'', ''Life of Antoninus Pius'', V, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He also continued Hadrian's policy of humanizing the laws. He died in 161&amp;nbsp;AD.

[[Marcus Aurelius]], known as the Philosopher, was the last of the [[Five Good Emperors]]. He was a stoic philosopher and wrote the ''[[Meditations]]''. He defeated barbarian tribes in the [[Marcomannic Wars]] as well as the [[Parthian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/72*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXXVII.&lt;/ref&gt; His co-emperor, [[Lucius Verus]] died in 169&amp;nbsp;AD, probably victim of the [[Antonine Plague]], a pandemic that killed nearly five million people through the Empire in 165–180&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4381924.stm Past pandemics that ravaged Europe] by Verity Murphy. [[BBC News]]. 7 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Nerva to Marcus Aurelius, the empire achieved an unprecedented happy and glorious status. The powerful influence of laws and manners had gradually cemented the union of the provinces. All the citizens enjoyed and abused the advantages of wealth. The image of a free constitution was preserved with decent reverence. The Roman senate appeared to possess the sovereign authority, and devolved on the emperors all the executive powers of government.{{clarify|date=June 2016}} The [[Five Good Emperors]]' rule is considered the golden era of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbon|first1=Edward|editor1-last=Bury|editor1-first=J.B.|title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|date=1906|publisher=Fred de Fau and Co.|language=English|chapter=Chapter I|chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commodus]], son of Marcus Aurelius, became emperor after his father's death. He is not counted as one of the [[Five Good Emperors]]. Firstly, this was due to his direct kinship with the latter emperor; in addition, he was passive in comparison with his predecessors, who were frequently leading their armies in person. Commodus usually took part on gladiatorial combats, which often symbolized brutality and roughness. He killed many citizens, and his reign was the beginning of Roman [[decadence]], as stated [[Cassius Dio]]: "(Rome has transformed) from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust."&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/72*.html#36] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXXII, 36, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Severan dynasty===
Commodus was killed by a conspiracy involving [[Quintus Aemilius Laetus]] and his wife Marcia in late 192&amp;nbsp;AD. The following year is known as the [[Year of the Five Emperors]], during which [[Helvius Pertinax]], [[Didius Julianus]], [[Pescennius Niger]], [[Clodius Albinus]] and [[Septimius Severus]] held the imperial dignity. Pertinax, a member of the senate who had been one of Marcus Aurelius's right hand men, was the choice of Laetus, and he ruled vigorously and judiciously. Laetus soon became jealous and instigated Pertinax's murder by the Praetorian Guard, who then auctioned the empire to the highest bidder, Didius Julianus, for 25,000 sesterces per man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cary|first1=Max|title=A History of Rome Down to the Reign of Constantine|date=1967|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|page=704|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Rome were appalled and appealed to the frontier legions to save them. The legions of three frontier provinces—[[Roman Britain|Britannia]], [[Pannonia Superior]], and [[Roman Syria|Syria]]—resented being excluded from the "donative" and replied by declaring their individual generals to be emperor. Lucius Septimius Severus Geta, the Pannonian commander, bribed the opposing forces, pardoned the Praetorian Guards and installed himself as emperor. He and his successors governed with the legions' support. The changes on [[coin]]age and military expenditures were the root of the financial crisis that marked the [[Crisis of the Third Century]].

==== Septimius Severus ====
[[File:Septimusseverustondo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[Severan Tondo]], c. 199, Severus, Julia Domna, Caracalla and Geta, whose face is erased]]
Severus was enthroned after invading Rome and having [[Didius Julianus]] killed. His two other rivals, [[Pescennius Niger]] and [[Clodius Albinus]], were both were hailed by other factions as ''Imperator''. Severus quickly subdued Niger in [[Byzantium]] and promised to Albinus the title of Caesar (which meant he would be a co-emperor).&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/75*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXXV, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Severus betrayed Albinus by blaming him for a plot against his life. Severus marched to Gaul and defeated Albinus. For these acts, [[Machiavelli]] said that Severus was "a ferocious lion and a clever fox"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/ml/libri/m/MachiavelliNB_IlPrincipe_s.pdf] Machiavelli, ''Il Principe'', XIX (in Italian).&lt;/ref&gt;

Severus attempted to revive totalitarianism and in an address to people and the Senate, he praised the severity and cruelty of Marius and Sulla, which worried the senators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/76*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXXVI, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Parthia]] invaded Roman territory, Severus waged war against that country. He seized the cities of [[Nusaybin|Nisibis]], [[Babylon]] and [[Seleucia]]. Reaching [[Ctesiphon]], the Parthian capital, he ordered plundering and his army slew and captured many people. Albeit this military success, he failed in invading [[Hatra]], a rich Arabian city. Severus killed his legate, as the latter was gaining respect from the legions; and his soldiers were hit by famine. After this disastrous campaign, he withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/76*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXXVI, 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Severus also intended to vanquish the whole of Britannia. To achieve this, he [[Roman invasion of Caledonia 208–210|waged war]] against the [[Caledonians]]. After many casualties in the army due to the terrain and the barbarians' ambushes, Severus went himself to the field. However, he became ill and died in 211&amp;nbsp;AD, at the age of 65.

====From Caracalla to Alexander Severus====
[[File:Bust of Caracalla Antikensammlung Berlin.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Caracalla]] from the [[Pergamon Museum]], Berlin]]
Upon the death of Severus, his sons [[Caracalla]] and [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] were made emperors. During their youth, their squabbles had divided Rome into two factions. In that same year Caracalla had his brother, a youth, assassinated in his mother's arms, and may have murdered 20,000 of Geta's followers. Like his father, Caracalla was warlike. He continued Severus' policy, and gained respect from the legions. Caracalla was a cruel man, and was pursued by the guilt of his brother's murder. He ordered the death of people of his own circle, like his tutor, Cilo, and a friend of his father, [[Papinian]].

Knowing that the citizens of [[Alexandria]] disliked him and were speaking ill of his character, he served a banquet for its notable citizens, after which his soldiers killed all the guests. From the security of the temple of Sarapis, he then directed an in-discriminant slaughter of Alexandria's people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/78*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXXVIII, 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Caracalla*.html#ref35] ''Historia Augusta'', ''The Life of Caracalla'', VI.&lt;/ref&gt; In 212, he issued the [[Constitutio Antoniniana|Edict of Caracalla]], giving full Roman citizenship to all free men living in the Empire, and at the same time raised the inheritance tax, levied only on Roman citizens, to ten percent. A report that a soothsayer had predicted that the [[Praetorian prefect]] [[Macrinus]] and his son were to rule over the empire was dutifully sent to Caracalla. But the report fell into the hands of Macrinus, who felt he must act or die. Macrinus conspired to have Caracalla assassinated by one of his soldiers during a pilgrimage to the Temple of the Moon in Carrhae, in 217&amp;nbsp;AD.

The incompetent Macrinus, assumed power, but soon removed himself from Rome to the east and Antioch. His brief reign ended in 218, when the youngster Bassianus, high priest of the temple of the Sun at Emesa, and supposedly illegitimate son of Caracalla, was declared Emperor by the disaffected soldiers of Macrinus. Bribes gained Bassianus support from the legionaries and they fought against Macrinus and his Praetorian guards. He adopted the name of Antoninus but history has named him after his Sun god [[Elagabalus]], represented on Earth in the form of a large black stone. Elagabalus was an incompetent and lascivious ruler,&lt;ref name=haywood2 /&gt; who was well known for extreme extravagance, that offended all but his favorites. [[Cassius Dio]], [[Herodian]] and the [[Historia Augusta]] have many accounts about his extravagance. He adopted his cousin, [[Alexander Severus]], as Caesar, grew jealous, and attempted to assassinate him. The Praetorian guard preferred Alexander, murdered Elagabalus, dragged his mutilated corpse through the streets of Rome, and threw it into the Tiber. Elagabalus was succeeded by his cousin [[Alexander Severus]]. Alexander waged war against many foes, like the revitalized [[Persia]] and [[Germanic peoples]] who invaded Gaul. His losses made the soldiers dissatisfied with the emperor, and some of them killed him during his Germanic campaign, in 235&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Severus_Alexander/3*.html#ref239] ''Historia Augusta'', ''The Life of Alexander Severus'', LIX.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crisis of the Third Century ===
{{main|Crisis of the Third Century}}
[[File:Map of Ancient Rome 271 AD.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|The Roman Empire suffered internal schisms, forming the [[Palmyrene Empire]] and the [[Gallic Empire]]]]

A disastrous scenario emerged after the death of [[Alexander Severus]]: the Roman state was plagued by civil wars, external [[invasion]]s, political chaos, [[Plague of Cyprian|pandemics]] and [[Economic collapse|economic depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.boisestate.edu/westciv/empire/15.shtml |title=Crisis of the Third Century (235–285) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503114611/http://history.boisestate.edu/westciv/empire/15.shtml |archive-date=3 May 2007 |work=History of Western Civilization |first=E.L. |last=Skip Knox |publisher=Boise State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=haywood2 /&gt; The old Roman values had fallen, and [[Mithraism]] and Christianity had begun to spread through the populace. Emperors were no longer men linked with nobility; they usually were born in lower-classes of distant parts of the Empire. These men rose to prominence through military ranks, and became emperors through civil wars.

There were 26 emperors in a 49-year period, a signal of political instability. [[Maximinus Thrax]] was the first ruler of that time, governing for just three years. Others ruled just for a few months, like [[Gordian I]], [[Gordian II]], [[Balbinus]] and [[Hostilian]]. The population and the frontiers were abandoned, since the emperors were mostly concerned with defeating rivals and establishing their power. The economy also suffered during that epoch. The massive military expenditures from the [[Severan dynasty|Severi]] caused a devaluation of Roman coins. [[Hyperinflation]] came at this time as well. The [[Plague of Cyprian]] broke out in 250 and killed a huge portion of the population.&lt;ref name="Gibbon10"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbon|first1=Edward|editor1-last=Bury|editor1-first=J.B.|title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|date=1906|publisher=Fred de Fau and Co.|chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/731/731-h/731-h.htm#link102HCH0001|language=English|chapter-format=Online version|chapter=Chapter X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 260&amp;nbsp;AD, the provinces of [[Syria Palaestina]], [[Asia Minor]] and [[Aegyptus (Roman province)|Egypt]] separated from the rest of the Roman state to form the [[Palmyrene Empire]], ruled by Queen [[Zenobia]] and centered on [[Palmyra]]. In that same year the [[Gallic Empire]] was created by [[Postumus]], retaining Britannia and Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Tyranni_XXX*.html] ''Historia Augusta'', ''The Lives of the Thirty Pretenders'', III et XXX.&lt;/ref&gt; These countries separated from Rome after the capture of emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] by the [[Sassanid]]s of [[Persia]], the first Roman ruler to be captured by his enemies; it was a humiliating fact for the Romans.&lt;ref name="Gibbon10"/&gt; The crisis began to recede during the reigns of [[Claudius Gothicus]] (268–270), who [[Battle of Naissus|defeated]] the [[Goths|Gothic]] invaders, and [[Aurelian]] (271–275), who reconquered both the Gallic and Palmyrene Empires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Aurelian/2*.html] ''Historia Augusta'', ''The Life of Aurelian'', XXXII.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Claudius*.html] ''Historia Augusta'', ''The Life of Claudius'', I.&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis was overcome during the reign of [[Diocletian]].

==Empire – The Tetrarchy==
{{Main|Roman Empire}}

===Diocletian===
[[File:DiocletianusFollis-transparent.png|thumb|A Roman [[follis]] depicting the profile of [[Diocletian]]]]
In 284&amp;nbsp;AD, Diocletian was hailed as Imperator by the eastern army. Diocletian healed the empire from the crisis, by political and economic shifts. A new form of government was established: the [[Tetrarchy]]. The Empire was divided among four emperors, two in the West and two in the East. The first tetrarchs were Diocletian (in the East), [[Maximian]] (in the West), and two junior emperors, [[Galerius]] (in the East) and [[Constantius Chlorus|Flavius Constantius]] (in the West). To adjust the economy, Diocletian made several tax reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/lactant/lactpers.html#VII] Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'', VII.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diocletian expelled the Persians who plundered Syria and conquered some barbarian tribes with Maximian. He adopted many behaviors of Eastern monarchs, like wearing pearls and golden sandals and robes. Anyone in the presence of the emperor had now to prostrate himself—a common act in the East, but never practiced in Rome before.&lt;ref&gt;Joannes Zonaras, ''Epitome: From Diocletian to the death of Galerius''&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian did not use a disguised form of Republic, as the other emperors since [[Augustus]] had done.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/dioclet.htm Diocletian (284–305 AD)] by Ralph W. Mathisen. De Imperatoribus Romanis.  17 March 1997.

In 303 he and [[Galerius]] started the persecution and ordered the destruction of all the Christian churches and scripts and forbade Christian worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/lactant/lactpers.html#X] Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'', X–XVI.&lt;/ref&gt; Diocletian abdicated in 305&amp;nbsp;AD together with [[Maximian]], thus, he was the first Roman emperor to resign. His reign ended the traditional form of imperial rule, the [[Principate]] (from [[princeps]]) and started the [[Tetrarchy]].

=== Constantine and Christianity ===
[[Constantine I|Constantine]] assumed the empire as a tetrarch in 306. He conducted many wars against the other tetrarchs. Firstly he defeated [[Maxentius]] in 312. In 313, he issued the [[Edict of Milan]], which granted liberty for Christians to profess their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbon|first1=Edward|editor1-last=Bury|editor1-first=J.B.|title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|date=1906|publisher=Fred de Fau and Co.|language=English|chapter=Chapter XX}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine was converted to Christianity, enforcing the Christian faith. He began the Christianization of the Empire and of Europe—a process concluded by the Catholic Church in the [[Middle Ages]]. He was defeated by the [[Franks]] and the [[Alamanni]] during 306–308. In 324 he defeated another tetrarch, [[Licinius]], and controlled all the empire, as it was before [[Diocletian]]. To celebrate his victories and Christianity's relevance, he rebuilt [[Byzantium]] and renamed it Nova Roma ("New Rome"); but the city soon gained the informal name of [[Constantinople]] ("City of Constantine").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbon|first1=Edward|editor1-last=Bury|editor1-first=J.B.|title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|date=1906|publisher=Fred de Fau and Co.|chapter-url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/25717/25717-h/25717-h.htm#Blink182HCH0001|language=English|chapter-format=Online version|chapter=Chapter XVII}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/conniei.htm Constantine I (306–337 AD)] by Hans A.

The reign of [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], who under the influence of his adviser [[Mardonius (philosopher)|Mardonius]] attempted to restore [[Religion in ancient Rome|Classical Roman]] and [[Hellenistic religion]], only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors. Constantinople served as a new capital for the Empire. In fact, Rome had lost its central importance since the Crisis of the Third Century—[[Mediolanum]] was the western capital from 286 to 330, until the reign of [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], when [[Ravenna]] was made capital, in the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/honorius.htm Honorius (395–423 AD)] by Ralph W.

=== Law ===
{{Main|Roman law}}

The roots of the legal principles and practices of the [[Outline of ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] may be traced to the [[Twelve Tables|Law of the Twelve Tables]] promulgated in 449&amp;nbsp;BC and to the codification of law issued by order of Emperor [[Justinian I]] around 530&amp;nbsp;AD (see [[Corpus Juris Civilis]]). Roman law as preserved in Justinian's codes continued into the [[Byzantine Empire]], and formed the basis of similar codifications in continental Western Europe. Roman law continued, in a broader sense, to be applied throughout most of Europe until the end of the 17th century.

The major divisions of the law of ancient Rome, as contained within the Justinian and Theodosian law codes, consisted of ''Ius Civile'', ''Ius Gentium'', and ''Ius Naturale''. The ''Ius Civile'' ("Citizen Law") was the body of common laws that applied to Roman citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adkins|first1=Lesley|last2=Adkins|first2=Roy|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome|page=46|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-512332-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Praetor urbanus|''Praetores Urbani'']] (''sg. Praetor Urbanus'') were the people who had jurisdiction over cases involving citizens. The ''Ius Gentium'' ("Law of nations") was the body of common laws that applied to foreigners, and their dealings with Roman citizens.&lt;ref name="Duiker346"/&gt; The [[Praetor peregrinus|''Praetores Peregrini'']] (''sg. Praetor Peregrinus'') were the people who had jurisdiction over cases involving citizens and foreigners. ''Ius Naturale'' encompassed natural law, the body of laws that were considered common to all beings.

=== Class structure ===

Roman society is largely viewed as [[social hierarchy|hierarchical]], with [[slavery in antiquity|slaves]] (''servi'') at the bottom, [[freedman|freedmen]] (''liberti'') above them, and free-born citizens (''cives'') at the top. Free citizens were also divided by class. The broadest, and earliest, division was between the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]], who could trace their ancestry to one of the 100 [[Patriarch]]s at the founding of the city, and the [[plebs|plebeians]], who could not. This became less important in the later Republic, as some plebeian families became wealthy and entered politics, and some patrician families fell economically. Anyone, patrician or plebeian, who could count a consul as his ancestor was a [[nobility|noble]] (''nobilis''); a man who was the first of his family to hold the consulship, such as [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] or [[Cicero]], was known as a ''[[novus homo]]'' ("new man") and ennobled his descendants. Patrician ancestry, however, still conferred considerable prestige, and many religious offices remained restricted to patricians.

A class division originally based on military service became more important. Membership of these classes was determined periodically by the [[Roman censor|Censors]], according to property. The wealthiest were the Senatorial class, who dominated politics and command of the army. Next came the [[Equestrian order|equestrians]] (''equites'', sometimes translated "knights"), originally those who could afford a warhorse, and who formed a powerful mercantile class. Several further classes, originally based on the military equipment their members could afford, followed, with the ''proletarii'', citizens who had no property at all, at the bottom. Before the reforms of Marius they were ineligible for military service and are often described as being just above freed slaves in wealth and prestige.

Voting power in the Republic depended on class. Citizens were enrolled in voting "tribes", but the tribes of the richer classes had fewer members than the poorer ones, all the ''proletarii'' being enrolled in a single tribe. Voting was done in class order, from top down, and stopped as soon as most of the tribes had been reached, so the poorer classes were often unable to cast their votes.

Women shared some basic rights with their male counterparts, but were not fully regarded as citizens and were thus not allowed to vote or take part in politics. At the same time the limited rights of women were gradually expanded (due to [[emancipation]]) and women reached freedom from ''paterfamilias'', gained property rights and even had more juridical rights than their husbands, but still no voting rights, and were absent from politics.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Frost Abbott, ''Society and Politics in Ancient Rome'', BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2009, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Allied foreign cities were often given the [[Latin Right]], an intermediary level between full citizens and foreigners (''peregrini''), which gave their citizens rights under [[Roman law]] and allowed their leading magistrates to become full Roman citizens. While there were varying degrees of Latin rights, the main division was between those ''cum suffragio'' ("with vote"; enrolled in a [[Roman Tribes#The Servian tribes|Roman tribe]] and able to take part in the ''comitia tributa'') and ''sine suffragio'' ("without vote"; could not take part in Roman politics). Most of Rome's Italian allies were given full citizenship after the [[Social War (91–88&amp;nbsp;BC)|Social War]] of 91–88&amp;nbsp;BC, and full [[Roman citizenship]] was extended to all free-born men in the Empire by [[Caracalla]] in 212.

Initially, Rome was ruled by [[Roman Kingdom|kings]], who were elected from each of Rome's major tribes in turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matyszak|first1=Philip|title=Chronicle of the Roman Republic|date=2003|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-05121-4|pages=16–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact nature of the king's power is uncertain. He may have held near-absolute power, or may also have merely been the chief executive of the [[SPQR|Senate and the people]]. At least in military matters, the king's authority (''[[Imperium]]'') was likely absolute. He was also the head of the [[Religion in ancient Rome|state religion]]. In addition to the authority of the King, there were three administrative assemblies: the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], which acted as an advisory body for the King; the [[Curiate Assembly|Comitia Curiata]], which could endorse and ratify laws suggested by the King; and the [[Roman assemblies|Comitia Calata]], which was an assembly of the priestly college that could assemble the people to bear witness to certain acts, hear proclamations, and declare the [[Festival|feast]] and holiday schedule for the next month.

[[File:Cicerón denuncia a Catilina, por Cesare Maccari.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Representation of a sitting of the [[Roman Senate]]: [[Cicero]] attacks [[Catiline|Catilina]], from a 19th-century fresco]] The [[class struggle]]s of the [[Roman Republic]] resulted in an unusual mixture of democracy and [[oligarchy]]. The word republic comes from the Latin ''res publica'', which literally translates to "public business". [[List of Roman laws|Roman laws]] traditionally could only be passed by a vote of the Popular assembly ([[Tribal Assembly|Comitia Tributa]]). Likewise, candidates for public positions had to run for election by the people. However, the [[Roman Senate]] represented an oligarchic institution, which acted as an advisory body.

In the Republic, the Senate held actual authority (''auctoritas''), but no real legislative power; it was technically only an advisory council. However, as the Senators were individually very influential, it was difficult to accomplish anything against the collective will of the Senate. New Senators were chosen from among the most accomplished [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] by [[Roman censor|Censors]] (''Censura''), who could also remove a Senator from his office if he was found "morally corrupt"; a charge that could include bribery or, as under [[Cato the Elder]], embracing one's wife in public. Later, under the reforms of the dictator [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]], [[Quaestor]]s were made automatic members of the Senate, though most of his reforms did not survive.

The Republic had no fixed [[bureaucracy]], and collected taxes through the practice of [[tax farming]]. Government positions such as [[quaestor]], [[aedile]], or [[Prefect|praefect]] were funded by the office-holder. To prevent any citizen from gaining too much power, new [[magistrate]]s were elected annually and had to share power with a colleague. For example, under normal conditions, the highest authority was held by two consuls. In an emergency, a temporary [[Roman dictator|dictator]] could be appointed. Throughout the Republic, the administrative system was revised several times to comply with new demands. In the end, it proved inefficient for controlling the ever-expanding dominion of Rome, contributing to the establishment of the [[Roman Empire]].

In the early Empire, the pretense of a republican form of government was maintained. The [[Roman Emperor]] was portrayed as only a ''[[princeps]]'', or "first citizen", and the Senate gained legislative power and all legal authority previously held by the popular assemblies. However, the rule of the Emperors became increasingly [[Autocracy|autocratic]], and the Senate was reduced to an advisory body appointed by the Emperor. The Empire did not inherit a set bureaucracy from the Republic, since the Republic did not have any permanent governmental structures apart from the Senate. The Emperor appointed assistants and advisers, but the state lacked many institutions, such as a centrally planned [[budget]]. Some historians have cited this as a significant reason for the [[decline of the Roman Empire]].

The early Roman army (c. 500&amp;nbsp;BC) was, like those of other contemporary [[city-state]]s influenced by Greek civilization, a citizen ''[[militia]]'' that practiced [[hoplite]] tactics. It was small (the population of free men of military age was then about 9,000) and organized in five classes (in parallel to the ''[[Roman assemblies|comitia centuriata]]'', the body of citizens organized politically), with three providing hoplites and two providing light infantry. The early Roman army was tactically limited and its stance during this period was essentially defensive.&lt;ref name=keegan263&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keegan|first1=John|title=A History of Warfare|date=1993|publisher=Alfred A.

Knopf (New York 1989) {{ISBN|0-394-57188-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 3rd century BC, the Romans abandoned the hoplite formation in favor of a more flexible system in which smaller groups of 120 (or sometimes 60) men called ''[[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]]'' could maneuver more independently on the battlefield. Thirty maniples arranged in three lines with supporting troops constituted a [[Roman legion|legion]], totalling between 4,000 and 5,000 men.&lt;ref name=keegan263 /&gt;&lt;ref name= potter/&gt;

The early Republican legion consisted of five sections, each of which was equipped differently and had different places in formation: the three lines of manipular heavy infantry (''[[hastati]]'', ''[[principes]]'' and ''[[triarii]])'', a force of light infantry (''[[velites]]''), and the cavalry (''[[equites]]''). With the new organization came a new orientation toward the offensive and a much more aggressive posture toward adjoining city-states.&lt;ref name=keegan263 /&gt;&lt;ref name= potter/&gt;

At nominal full strength, an early Republican legion included 4,000 to 5,000 men: 3,600 to 4,800 heavy infantry, several hundred light infantry, and several hundred cavalrymen.&lt;ref name=keegan263 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldsworthy|first1=Adrian|title=The Roman Army at War 100 BC–AD 00|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-815057-2|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jo-Ann Shelton, ed., ''As the Romans Did: A Sourcebook in Roman Social History'', Oxford University Press (New York 1998){{ISBN|0-19-508974-X}}, pp. 245–249.&lt;/ref&gt; Legions were often significantly understrength from recruitment failures or following periods of active service due to accidents, battle casualties, disease and desertion. During the Civil War, Pompey's legions in the east were at full strength because they were recently recruited, while Caesar's legions were often well below nominal strength after long active service in Gaul. This pattern also held true for auxiliary forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldsworthy|first1=Adrian|title=The Complete Roman Army|date=2003|publisher=Thames and Hudson, Ltd.|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-05124-5|pages=22–24, 37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldsworthy|first1=Adrian|title=Caesar: Life of a Colossus|url=https://archive.org/details/caesarlifecoloss00gold_505|url-access=limited|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300126891|pages=[https://archive.org/details/caesarlifecoloss00gold_505/page/n392 384], 410–411, 425–427}} Another important factor discussed by Goldsworthy was absence of legionaries on detached duty.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the late Republican period, the typical legionary was a property-owning citizen farmer from a rural area (an ''adsiduus'') who served for particular (often annual) campaigns,&lt;ref&gt;Between 343 BC and 241 BC, the Roman army fought every year except for five. {{cite book|last1=Oakley|first1=Stephen P.|editor1-last=Flower|editor1-first=Harriet I.|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-00390-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani0000unse_s0h2/page/27 27]|chapter=The Early Republic|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani0000unse_s0h2/page/27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who supplied his own equipment and, in the case of ''equites'', his own mount. Harris suggests that down to 200&amp;nbsp;BC, the average rural farmer (who survived) might participate in six or seven campaigns. Freedmen and slaves (wherever resident) and urban citizens did not serve except in rare emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;P.A. Brunt, "Army and Land in the Roman Republic," in ''The Fall of the Roman Republic and Related Essays'', Oxford University Press (Oxford 1988) {{ISBN|0-19-814849-6}}, p. 253; William V.

After 200&amp;nbsp;BC, economic conditions in rural areas deteriorated as manpower needs increased, so that the property qualifications for service were gradually reduced. Beginning with [[Gaius Marius]] in 107&amp;nbsp;BC, citizens without property and some urban-dwelling citizens (''proletarii'') were enlisted and provided with equipment, although most legionaries continued to come from rural areas. Terms of service became continuous and long—up to twenty years if emergencies required although six- or seven-year terms were more typical.&lt;ref name="keegan273"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keegan|first1=John|title=A History of Warfare|date=1993|publisher=Alfred A.

Beginning in the 3rd century BC, legionaries were paid ''stipendium'' (amounts are disputed but Caesar famously "doubled" payments to his troops to 225 [[Denarius|''denarii'']] a year), could anticipate booty and donatives (distributions of plunder by commanders) from successful campaigns and, beginning at the time of Marius, often were granted allotments of land upon retirement.&lt;ref name=keegan263 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brunt, pp. 259–265; Potter, pp. 80–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Cavalry and light infantry attached to a legion (the ''auxilia'') were often recruited in the areas where the legion served. Caesar formed a legion, the Fifth Alaudae, from non-citizens in Transalpine Gaul to serve in his campaigns in Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldsworthy|first1=Adrian|title=Caesar: Life of a Colossus|url=https://archive.org/details/caesarlifecoloss00gold_505|url-access=limited|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300126891|page=[https://archive.org/details/caesarlifecoloss00gold_505/page/n399 391]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Caesar Augustus, the ideal of the citizen-soldier had been abandoned and the legions had become fully professional. Legionaries received 900 [[Sestertius|''sesterces'']] a year and could expect 12,000 ''sesterces'' on retirement.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Christ, ''The Romans'', University of California Press (Berkeley, 1984){{ISBN|0-520-04566-1}}, pp. 74–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the [[Final War of the Roman Republic|Civil War]], Augustus reorganized Roman military forces, discharging soldiers and disbanding legions. He retained 28 legions, distributed through the provinces of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mackay|first1=Christopher S.|title=Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-80918-4|pages=249–250}} Mackay points out that the number of legions (not necessarily the number of legionaries) grew to 30 by 125 AD and 33 during the [[Severan dynasty|Severan]] period (200–235 AD).&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Principate]], the tactical organization of the Army continued to evolve. The ''auxilia'' remained independent cohorts, and legionary troops often operated as groups of cohorts rather than as full legions. A new versatile type of unit—the ''cohortes equitatae''—combined cavalry and legionaries in a single formation. They could be stationed at garrisons or outposts and could fight on their own as balanced small forces or combine with other similar units as a larger legion-sized force. This increase in organizational flexibility helped ensure the long-term success of Roman military forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldsworthy|first1=Adrian|title=The Roman Army at War 100 BC – AD 200|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-815057-2|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Emperor [[Gallienus]] (253–268&amp;nbsp;AD) began a reorganization that created the last military structure of the late Empire. Withdrawing some legionaries from the fixed bases on the border, Gallienus created mobile forces (the ''[[Comitatenses]]'' or field armies) and stationed them behind and at some distance from the borders as a strategic reserve. The border troops (''limitanei'') stationed at fixed bases continued to be the first line of defense. The basic unit of the field army was the "regiment", ''legiones'' or ''auxilia'' for infantry and ''vexellationes'' for cavalry. Evidence suggests that nominal strengths may have been 1,200 men for infantry regiments and 600 for cavalry, although many records show lower actual troop levels (800 and 400).&lt;ref name="Hugh Elton 1996 pp. 89-96"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elton|first1=Hugh|title=Warfare in Roman Europe AD 350–425|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-815241-5|pages=89–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many infantry and cavalry regiments operated in pairs under the command of a ''[[comes]]''. In addition to Roman troops, the field armies included regiments of "barbarians" recruited from allied tribes and known as ''[[foederati]]''. By 400&amp;nbsp;AD, ''foederati'' regiments had become permanently established units of the Roman army, paid and equipped by the Empire, led by a Roman tribune and used just as Roman units were used. In addition to the ''foederati'', the Empire also used groups of barbarians to fight along with the legions as "allies" without integration into the field armies. Under the command of the senior Roman general present, they were led at lower levels by their own officers.&lt;ref name="Hugh Elton 1996 pp. 89-96"/&gt;

Military leadership evolved over the course of the history of Rome. Under the monarchy, the hoplite armies were led by the kings of Rome. During the early and middle Roman Republic, military forces were under the command of one of the two elected [[Roman consul|consuls]] for the year. During the later Republic, members of the Roman Senatorial elite, as part of the normal sequence of elected public offices known as the ''[[cursus honorum]]'', would have served first as ''[[quaestor]]'' (often posted as deputies to field commanders), then as ''[[praetor]]''.&lt;ref name="bcorrey"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brennan|first1=Correy T.|editor1-last=Flower|editor1-first=Harriet I.|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-00390-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani0000unse_s0h2/page/66 66–68]|chapter=Power and Process Under the Republican 'Constitution'|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani0000unse_s0h2/page/66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldsworthy|first1=Adrian|title=The Roman Army at War 100 BC – AD 200|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-815057-2|pages=121–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julius Caesar's most talented, effective and reliable subordinate in Gaul, [[Titus Labienus]], was recommended to him by [[Pompey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldsworthy|first1=Adrian|title=The Roman Army at War 100 BC – AD 200|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-815057-2|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Altar Domitius Ahenobarbus Louvre n3bis.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|[[Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus]], c. 122 BC; the altar shows two Roman infantrymen equipped with long ''[[Scutum (shield)|scuta]]'' and a cavalryman with his horse. All are shown wearing [[chain mail]] armour.]]
Following the end of a term as praetor or consul, a Senator might be appointed by the Senate as a [[Promagistrate|''propraetor'']] or [[Promagistrate|''proconsul'']] (depending on the highest office held before) to govern a foreign province. More junior officers (down to but not including the level of centurion) were selected by their commanders from their own ''[[Patronage in ancient Rome|clientelae]]'' or those recommended by political allies among the Senatorial elite.&lt;ref name="bcorrey" /&gt;

Under Augustus, whose most important political priority was to place the military under a permanent and unitary command, the Emperor was the legal commander of each legion but exercised that command through a ''[[legatus]]'' (legate) he appointed from the Senatorial elite. In a province with a single legion, the legate commanded the legion (''[[legatus legionis]]'') and also served as provincial governor, while in a province with more than one legion, each legion was commanded by a legate and the legates were commanded by the provincial governor (also a legate but of higher rank).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mackay|first1=Christopher S.|title=Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-80918-4|pages=245–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the later stages of the Imperial period (beginning perhaps with [[Diocletian]]), the Augustan model was abandoned. Provincial governors were stripped of military authority, and command of the armies in a group of provinces was given to generals ([[Dux|''duces'']]) appointed by the Emperor. These were no longer members of the Roman elite but men who came up through the ranks and had seen much practical soldiering. With increasing frequency, these men attempted (sometimes successfully) to usurp the positions of the Emperors who had appointed them. Decreased resources, increasing political chaos and civil war eventually left the Western Empire vulnerable to attack and takeover by neighboring barbarian peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mackay|first1=Christopher S.|title=Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-80918-4|pages=295–296}}. Also chapters 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less is known about the [[Roman navy]] than the Roman army. Prior to the middle of the 3rd century BC, officials known as ''duumviri navales'' commanded a fleet of twenty ships used mainly to control piracy. This fleet was given up in 278&amp;nbsp;AD and replaced by allied forces. The [[Punic Wars|First Punic War]] required that Rome build large fleets, and it did so largely with the assistance of and financing from allies. This reliance on allies continued to the end of the Roman Republic. The [[quinquereme]] was the main warship on both sides of the Punic Wars and remained the mainstay of Roman naval forces until replaced by the time of Caesar Augustus by lighter and more maneuverable vessels.&lt;ref name="Potter pp. 76-78"&gt;This paragraph is based upon Potter, pp. 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

As compared with a [[trireme]], the quinquereme permitted the use of a mix of experienced and inexperienced crewmen (an advantage for a primarily land-based power), and its lesser maneuverability permitted the Romans to adopt and perfect [[Corvus (weapon)|boarding tactics]] using a troop of about 40 marines in lieu of the [[Naval tactics in the Age of Galleys|ram]]. Ships were commanded by a ''[[navarch]]'', a rank equal to a centurion, who was usually not a citizen. Potter suggests that because the fleet was dominated by non-Romans, the navy was considered non-Roman and allowed to atrophy in times of peace.&lt;ref name="Potter pp. 76-78"/&gt;

Information suggests that by the time of the late Empire (350&amp;nbsp;AD), the Roman navy comprised several fleets including warships and merchant vessels for transportation and supply. Warships were oared sailing galleys with three to five banks of oarsmen. Fleet bases included such ports as Ravenna, Arles, Aquilea, Misenum and the mouth of the Somme River in the West and Alexandria and Rhodes in the East. Flotillas of small river craft (''classes'') were part of the ''limitanei'' (border troops) during this period, based at fortified river harbors along the Rhine and the Danube. That prominent generals commanded both armies and fleets suggests that naval forces were treated as auxiliaries to the army and not as an independent service. The details of command structure and fleet strengths during this period are not well known, although fleets were commanded by prefects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elton|first1=Hugh|title=Warfare in Roman Europe AD 350–425|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-815241-5|pages=99–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trajan's market.jpg|thumb|left|upright=2|Night view of [[Trajan's Market]], built by [[Apollodorus of Damascus]]]]

Ancient Rome commanded a vast area of land, with tremendous natural and human resources. As such, Rome's economy remained focused on [[Farming in ancient Rome|farming]] and trade. Agricultural [[free trade]] changed the Italian landscape, and by the 1st century BC, vast grape and [[olive]] estates had supplanted the [[yeoman]] farmers, who were unable to match the imported grain price. The [[annexation]] of [[Egypt]], Sicily and [[Tunisia]] in North Africa provided a continuous supply of grains. In turn, [[olive oil]] and [[Ancient Rome and wine|wine]] were Italy's main exports. Two-tier [[crop rotation]] was practiced, but farm productivity was low, around 1 ton per hectare.

Industrial and manufacturing activities were smaller. The largest such activities were the mining and [[quarry]]ing of stones, which provided basic construction materials for the buildings of that period. In manufacturing, production was on a relatively small scale, and generally consisted of workshops and small factories that employed at most dozens of workers. However, some brick factories employed hundreds of workers.

The economy of the early Republic was largely based on smallholding and paid labor. However, foreign wars and conquests made [[slavery in antiquity|slaves]] increasingly cheap and plentiful, and by the late Republic, the economy was largely dependent on [[Slavery|slave labor]] for both skilled and unskilled work. Slaves are estimated to have constituted around 20% of the Roman Empire's population at this time and 40% in the city of Rome. Only in the Roman Empire, when the conquests stopped and the prices of slaves increased, did hired labor become more economical than slave ownership.

Although [[barter]] was used in ancient Rome, and often used in tax collection, Rome had a very developed [[coin]]age system, with [[Brass instrument|brass]], [[bronze]], and [[precious metal]] coins in circulation throughout the Empire and beyond—some have even been discovered in [[India]]. Before the 3rd century BC, copper was traded by weight, measured in unmarked lumps, across [[central Italy]]. The original [[British coinage|copper coins]] (''[[As (Roman coin)|as]]'') had a face value of one [[Pound (weight)#Origins|Roman pound]] of copper, but weighed less. Thus, Roman money's utility as a unit of exchange consistently exceeded its [[Intrinsic value (numismatics)|intrinsic value]] as metal. After [[Nero]] began debasing the silver [[denarius]], its [[legal tender|legal]] value was an estimated one-third greater than its intrinsic value.

Horses were expensive and other [[pack animal]]s were slower. Mass trade on the [[Roman roads]] connected military posts, where Roman markets were centered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4aX-W6AVNv8C&amp;pg=PA231 |title=The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare|page=231|editor1-last=Sabin|editor1-first=Philip|editor2-last=van Wees|editor2-first=Hans|editor3-last=Whitby|editor3-first=Michael|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2007|isbn=978-0521782746}}&lt;/ref&gt; These roads were designed for wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fm5l000EmoAC+|title=Roads to Rome|page=11|last=Heseltine|first=John|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|date=2005|isbn=978-0711225527}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there was transport of [[commodity|commodities]] between Roman regions, but increased with the rise of [[Roman commerce#Sea routes|Roman maritime trade]] in the 2nd century BC. During that period, a trading vessel took less than a month to complete a trip from [[Cádiz|Gades]] to [[Alexandria]] via [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]], spanning the entire length of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].&lt;ref name=Atlas/&gt; Transport by sea was around 60 times cheaper than by land, so the volume for such trips was much larger.

Some economists consider the Roman Empire a [[market economy]], similar in its degree of capitalistic practices to 17th century Netherlands and 18th century England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eh.net/abstracts/archive/0370.php |last=Temin |first=Peter |title=A Market Economy in the Early Roman Empire |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615223139/http://eh.net/abstracts/archive/0370.php |archive-date=15 June 2010 |work=Abstract Archives |year=2001 |publisher=Economy History Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the upper classes, slaves and servants were also part of the household.&lt;ref name="Duiker346"/&gt; The power of the head of the household was supreme (''patria potestas'', "father's power") over those living with him: He could force marriage (usually for money) and divorce, sell his children into slavery, claim his dependents' property as his own, and even had the right to punish or kill family members (though this last right apparently ceased to be exercised after the 1st century BC).&lt;ref name="Cassonpageset1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casson|first1=Lionel|title=Everyday Life in Ancient Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/everydaylifeinan00cass|url-access=registration|date=1998|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-5992-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/everydaylifeinan00cass/page/10 10–11]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Patria potestas'' even extended over adult sons with their own households: A man was not considered a ''paterfamilias'', nor could he truly hold property, while his own father lived.&lt;ref name="Cassonpageset1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fathom.lib.uchicago.edu/1/777777121908/ Family Values in Ancient Rome] by Richard Saller.

Little affection was shown for the [[Children of Ancient Rome|children of Rome]]. The mother or an elderly relative often raised both boys and girls. Unwanted children were often sold as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=85Gdul_43DEC&amp;pg=PP7|title=The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives|last=Rawson|first=Beryl|date=1987|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0801494604|page=7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children might have waited on tables for the family, but they could not have participated in the conversation.

In noble families a Greek nurse usually taught the children Latin and Greek. Their father taught the boys how to swim and ride, although he sometimes hired a slave to teach them instead. At seven, a boy began his education. Having no school building, classes were held on a rooftop (if dark, the boy had to carry a lantern to school). Wax-covered boards were used as paper, papyrus, and parchment were too expensive—or he could just write in the sand. A loaf of bread to be eaten was also carried.&lt;ref&gt;Lifepac History &amp; Geography, Grade 6 Unit 3, p. 28.z&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups of related households formed a family (''[[gens]]''). Families were based on blood ties or [[adoption]], but were also political and economic alliances. Especially during the [[Roman Republic]], some powerful families, or ''[[Gens|Gentes Maiores]]'', came to dominate political life.

In ancient Rome, marriage was often regarded more as a financial and political alliance than as a romantic association, especially in the upper classes (see [[marriage in ancient Rome]]). Fathers usually began seeking husbands for their daughters when these reached an age between twelve and fourteen. The husband was usually older than the bride. While upper-class girls married very young, there is evidence that lower-class women often married in their late teens or early 20s.

{{Main|Culture of ancient Rome}}
[[File:Seven Hills of Rome.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[seven hills of Rome]]]]

Life in ancient Rome revolved around the city of Rome, located on [[Seven hills of Rome|seven hills]]. The city had a vast number of [[monument]]al structures like the [[Colosseum]], the [[Trajan's Forum|Forum of Trajan]] and the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]. It had [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatres]], [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasiums]], marketplaces, functional sewers, [[thermae|bath complexes]] complete with libraries and shops, and fountains with fresh drinking water supplied by hundreds of miles of [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]]. Throughout the territory under the control of ancient Rome, residential architecture ranged from modest houses to [[Roman villa|country villas]].

In the capital city of Rome, there were [[Roman Empire|imperial]] [[House|residences]] on the elegant [[Palatine Hill]], from which the word ''palace'' derives. The low [[Plebs|Plebeian]] and middle [[Equestrian order|Equestrian]] classes lived in the city center, packed into apartments, or [[Insulae]], which were almost like modern [[ghetto]]s.

While [[Latin]] remained the main written language of the Roman Empire, [[Greek language|Greek]] came to be the language spoken by the well-educated elite, as most of the literature studied by Romans was written in Greek. In the eastern half of the Roman Empire, which later became the [[Byzantine Empire]], Latin was never able to replace Greek, and after the death of Justinian, Greek became the official language of the Byzantine government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adkins|first1=Lesley|last2=Adkins|first2=Roy|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome|page=203|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-512332-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of the Roman Empire spread Latin throughout Europe, and Vulgar Latin evolved into [[dialect]]s in different locations, gradually shifting into many distinct [[Romance languages]].

Archaic [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], at least concerning the gods, was made up not of written [[narrative]]s, but rather of complex interrelations between gods and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matyszak|first1=Philip|title=Chronicle of the Roman Republic|date=2003|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-05121-4|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in [[Greek mythology]], the gods were not personified, but were vaguely defined sacred spirits called ''[[Numen|numina]]''. Romans also believed that every person, place or thing had its own ''[[genius (mythology)|genius]]'', or divine soul. During the [[Roman Republic]], [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] was organized under a strict system of priestly offices, which were held by men of senatorial rank. The College of Pontifices was uppermost body in this hierarchy, and its chief priest, the ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'', was the head of the state religion. [[Flamen]]s took care of the cults of various gods, while [[augur]]s were trusted with taking the [[auspice]]s. The [[Rex Sacrorum|sacred king]] took on the religious responsibilities of the deposed kings. In the Roman Empire, emperors were deified,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Gibbon|title=The history of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HvIbFyM1s54C&amp;pg=PA91|year=1787|publisher=printed for J.J.

As contact with the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] increased, the old [[Roman mythology|Roman gods]] became increasingly associated with [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek gods]].&lt;ref name="willis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Willis|first1=Roy|title=World Mythology: The Illustrated Guide|date=2000|publisher=Ken Fin Books|location=Victoria|isbn=978-1-86458-089-1|pages=166–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] was perceived to be the same deity as [[Zeus]], [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] became associated with [[Ares]], and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] with [[Poseidon]]. The Roman gods also assumed the attributes and mythologies of these Greek gods. Under the Empire, the Romans absorbed the mythologies of their conquered subjects, often leading to situations in which the temples and priests of traditional Italian deities existed side by side with those of foreign gods.&lt;ref&gt;willis&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with Emperor [[Nero]] in the 1st century AD, Roman official policy towards Christianity was negative, and at some points, simply being a Christian could be punishable by death. Under Emperor [[Diocletian]], the [[persecution of Christians]] reached its peak. However, it became an officially supported religion in the Roman state under Diocletian's successor, [[Constantine I]], with the signing of the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, and quickly became dominant. All religions except Christianity were prohibited in 391&amp;nbsp;AD by an edict of Emperor [[Theodosius I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/theo1.htm Theodosius I (379–395 AD)] by David Woods.

===Ethics and morality===
Like many ancient cultures, concepts of ethics and morality, while sharing some commonalities with modern society, differed greatly in several important ways. Because ancient civilizations like Rome were under constant threat of attack from marauding tribes, their culture was necessarily militaristic with martial skills being a prized attribute.&lt;ref name="HuffPo: Bread"&gt;{{cite news | title=Bread and Circuses in Rome and America | author=Astore, William | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-astore/bread-and-circuses-in-rom_b_3414248.html | accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas modern societies consider [[compassion]] a virtue, Roman society considered compassion a vice, a moral defect. Indeed, one of the primary purposes of the gladiatorial games was to inoculate Roman citizens from this weakness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Annual Editions: Western Civilization | volume=1 | edition=12 | publisher=McGraw-Hill/Dushkin | year=2002 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87_ImL1ryQ8C | page=68 | quote=... where compassion was regarded as a moral defect ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPo: Bread"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Look Back to Get Ahead: Life Lessons from History's Heroes | author=Jackson, Michael Anthony | publisher=Arcade Publishing | year=2004| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkU9IuW1IuAC | page=174 | quote=Gladatorial games were popular because the Romans actually believed that compassion was a vice and a weakness| isbn=9781559707275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Romans instead prized virtues such as courage and conviction (''virtus''), a sense of duty to one's people, moderation and avoiding excess (''moderatio''), forgiveness and understanding (''clementia''), fairness (''severitas''), and loyalty (''pietas'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Daily Life in Ancient Rome: A Sourcebook | editor=Harvey, Brian K. | publisher=Hackett Publishing Company | year=2016 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=agyhCwAAQBAJ | pages=21–28| isbn=9781585107964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to popular descriptions, Roman society had well-established and restrictive norms related to sexuality, though as with many societies, the lion's share of the responsibilities fell on women. Women were generally expected to be monogamous having only a single husband during their life (''univira''), though this was much less regarded by the elite, especially under the empire. Women were expected to be modest in public avoiding any provocative appearance and to demonstrate absolute fidelity to their husbands (''pudicitia''). Indeed, wearing a veil was a common expectation to preserve modesty. Sex outside of marriage was generally frowned upon for men and women and indeed was made illegal during the imperial period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Sexual Morality in Ancient Rome | author=Langlands, Rebecca | year=2006 | publisher=Cambridge University Press| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GBLnttutuOMC | pages=3–20| isbn=9780521859431 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, prostitution was seen entirely differently and indeed was an accepted and regulated practice.&lt;ref name=Dillon&gt;{{cite book | author=Mathew Dillon and Lynda Garland| title=Ancient Rome: From the Early Republic to the Assassination of Julius Caesar | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis, 2005 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qMNL0jqhygoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ISBN9780415224598 | isbn=9780415224598 |page= 382| year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved 22 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Several examples of Roman painting have been found at [[Pompeii]], and from these [[History of art|art historians]] divide the history of Roman painting into four periods. The first style of Roman painting was practiced from the early 2nd century BC to the early- or mid-1st century BC. It was mainly composed of imitations of [[marble]] and [[masonry]], though sometimes including depictions of mythological characters.

The second style of Roman painting began during the early 1st century BC, and attempted to depict realistically three-dimensional architectural features and landscapes. The third style occurred during the reign of [[Augustus]] (27&amp;nbsp;BC&amp;nbsp;– 14&amp;nbsp;AD), and rejected the [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] of the second style in favor of simple ornamentation. A small architectural scene, landscape, or abstract design was placed in the center with a [[wikt:monochrome|monochrome]] background. The fourth style, which began in the 1st century AD, depicted scenes from mythology, while retaining architectural details and abstract patterns.

Portrait sculpture during the period{{Which|date=September 2014}} utilized youthful and classical proportions, evolving later into a mixture of realism and [[idealism]]. During the [[Antonines|Antonine]] and [[Severan dynasty|Severan]] periods, ornate hair and bearding, with deep cutting and drilling, became popular. Advancements were also made in [[Relief|relief sculptures]], usually depicting Roman victories.

[[Latin literature]] was, from its start, influenced heavily by Greek authors. Some of the earliest extant works are of historical [[Epic poetry|epics]] telling the early military history of Rome. As the Republic expanded, authors began to produce poetry, comedy, history, and [[tragedy]].

[[Music of ancient Rome|Roman music]] was largely based on [[Music of ancient Greece|Greek music]], and played an important part in many aspects of Roman life.&lt;ref name=iClassics&gt;{{cite book|author1=Donald Jay Grout|author2=Claude V.

Most religious rituals featured musical performances, with ''tibiae'' (double pipes) at sacrifices, [[cymbal]]s and [[Tambourine]]s at [[orgy|orgiastic]] [[Cult (religious practice)|cults]], and [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]] and [[hymns]] across the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adkins|first1=Lesley|last2=Adkins|first2=Roy|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome|page=300|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-512332-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some music historians believe that music was used at almost all public ceremonies.&lt;ref name=iClassics/&gt; Music historians are not certain if Roman musicians made a significant contribution to the [[Music theory|theory]] or practice of music.&lt;ref name=iClassics/&gt;

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Ancient Roman cuisine}}

Ancient Roman cuisine changed over the long duration of this ancient civilization. Dietary habits were affected by the influence of Greek culture, the political changes from kingdom to republic to empire, and empire's enormous expansion, which exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques. In the beginning the differences between social classes were relatively small, but disparities evolved with the empire's growth. Men and women drank wine with their meals, a tradition that has been carried through to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uaRl9ZUtBYkC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=cuisine+of+ancient+rome&amp;q=cuisine%20of%20ancient%20rome|title=Cuisine and Culture: A History of Food and People|last=Civitello|first=Linda|date=29 March 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470403716|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public games were sponsored by leading Romans who wished to advertise their generosity and court popular approval; in the Imperial era, this usually meant the emperor. Several venues were developed specifically for public games. The [[Colisseum]] was built in the Imperial era to host, among other events, [[gladiator]]ial combats. These combats had begun as funeral games around the 4th century BC, and became popular spectator events in the late Republic and Empire. Gladiators had an exotic and inventive variety of arms and armour. They sometimes fought to the death, but more often to an adjudicated victory, dependent on a referee's decision. The outcome was usually in keeping with the mood of the watching crowd. Shows of exotic animals were popular in their own right; but sometimes animals were pitted against human beings, either armed professionals or unarmed criminals who had been condemned to a spectacular and theatrical public death in the arena. Some of these encounters were based on episodes from Roman or Greek mythology.

[[Chariot racing]] was extremely popular among all classes. In Rome, these races were usually held at the [[Circus Maximus]], which had been purpose-built for chariot and horse-racing and, as Rome's largest public place, was also used for festivals and animal shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/circusmaximus/circusmaximus.html Circus Maximus].

The track was divided lengthwise by a barrier that contained obelisks, temples, statues and lap-counters. The best seats were at the track-side, close to the action; they were reserved for Senators. Behind them sat the [[equites]] (knights), and behind the knights were the [[plebs]] (commoners) and non-citizens. The donor of the games sat on a high platform in the stands alongside images of the gods, visible to all. Large sums were bet on the outcomes of races. Some Romans offered prayers and sacrifices on behalf of their favourites, or laid [[curse tablets|curses]] on the opposing teams, and some aficionados were members of extremely, even violently partisan circus factions.

Ancient Rome boasted impressive technological feats, using many advancements that were lost in the [[Middle Ages]] and not rivaled again until the 19th and 20th centuries. An example of this is [[insulated glazing]], which was not invented again until the 1930s. Many practical Roman innovations were adopted from earlier Greek designs.

[[Roman engineering|Roman civil engineering]] and [[Roman military engineering|military engineering]] constituted a large part of Rome's technological superiority and legacy, and contributed to the construction of hundreds of roads, bridges, [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueducts]], [[public bathing|baths]], theaters and [[arena]]s. Many monuments, such as the [[Colosseum]], [[Pont du Gard]], and [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], remain as testaments to Roman engineering and culture.

The Romans were renowned for their [[Roman architecture|architecture]], which is grouped with Greek traditions into "[[Classical architecture]]". Although there were many differences from [[Architecture of ancient Greece|Greek architecture]], Rome borrowed heavily from Greece in adhering to strict, formulaic building designs and proportions. Aside from two new [[classical order|orders]] of columns, [[composite order|composite]] and [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]], and from the [[dome]], which was derived from the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[arch]], Rome had relatively few architectural innovations until the end of the Republic.

In the 1st century BC, Romans started to use [[Roman concrete|concrete]] widely. Concrete was invented in the late 3rd century BC.

In the late 1st century BC, Rome also began to use [[glassblowing]] soon after its invention in [[Syria]] about 50&amp;nbsp;BC. [[Mosaic]]s took the Empire by storm after samples were retrieved during [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]'s campaigns in Greece.

The Romans also largely built using timber, causing a rapid decline of the woodlands surrounding Rome and in much of the Apennine Mountains due to the demand for wood for construction, shipbuilding and fire. The first evidence of long-distance wood trading come from the discovery of wood planks, felled between A.D. 40 and 60, coming from the Jura mountains in northeastern France and ending up more than 1,055 miles away, in the foundations of a lavish portico that was part of a vast wealthy patrician villa, in Central Rome. It is suggested that timber, around 4 meters long, came up to Rome via the Tiber River via ships traveling across the Mediterranean Sea from the confluence of the [[Saône]] and [[Rhône]] rivers in what is now the city of [[Lyon]] in present-day France.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Charles Q.

The Romans also made major advancements in [[sanitation]]. Romans were particularly famous for their public [[bathing|baths]], called ''[[thermae]]'', which were used for both hygienic and social purposes. Many Roman houses came to have [[flush toilet]]s and [[Tap water|indoor plumbing]], and a complex [[Sanitary sewer|sewer]] system, the ''[[Cloaca Maxima]]'', was used to drain the local [[marsh]]es and carry waste into the Tiber river.

Some historians have speculated that lead pipes in the sewer and plumbing systems led to widespread [[lead poisoning]], which contributed to the decline in [[birth rate]] and general decay of Roman society leading up to the [[decline of the Roman Empire|fall of Rome]]. However, lead content would have been minimized because the flow of water from aqueducts could not be shut off; it ran continuously through public and private outlets into the drains, and only a few taps were in use.&lt;ref&gt;''Roman Aqueducts and Water Supply'' by A.T. Hodge (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have raised similar objections to this theory, also pointing out that Roman water pipes were thickly coated with deposits that would have prevented lead from leaching into the water.&lt;ref name=Grout2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/leadpoisoning.html |title=Lead Poisoning and Rome |first=James |last=Grout |publisher=University of Chicago |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60N6AQZTk?url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/leadpoisoning.html |archivedate=22 July 2011 |accessdate=22 July 2011 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
{{Main|Roman historiography}}
{{more citations needed section|date=September 2014}}

Although there has been a diversity of works on ancient Roman history, many of them are lost. As a result of this loss, there are gaps in Roman history, which are filled by unreliable works, such as the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' and other books from obscure authors. However, there remains a number of reliable accounts of Roman history.

===In Roman times===
The first historians used their works for the lauding of Roman culture and customs. By the end of Republic, some historians distorted their histories to flatter their patrons—especially at the time of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]]'s and [[Sulla]]'s clash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Marius*.html] Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives'', ''Life of Marius'', XI, 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] wrote his own histories to make a complete account of his military campaigns in [[Gaul]] and during the [[Caesar's Civil War|Civil War]].

In the Empire, the biographies of famous men and early emperors flourished, examples being ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'' of Suetonius, and Plutarch's ''[[Parallel Lives]]''. Other major works of Imperial times were that of Livy and Tacitus.
* [[Polybius]] – ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]]''
* [[Sallust]] – ''[[Catiline|Bellum Catilinae]]'' and ''[[Jugurthine War|Bellum Jugurthinum]]''
* [[Julius Caesar]] – ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'' and ''[[De Bello Civili]]''
* [[Livy]] – ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]''
* [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] – ''Roman Antiquities''
* [[Pliny the Elder]] – ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''
* [[Josephus]] – ''[[The Jewish War]]''
* [[Suetonius]] – ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'' (''De Vita Caesarum'')
* [[Tacitus]] – ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annales]]'' and ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]''
* [[Plutarch]] – ''[[Parallel Lives]]'' (a series of biographies of famous Roman and Greek men)
* [[Cassius Dio]] – ''Historia Romana''
* [[Herodian]] – ''History of the Roman Empire since Marcus Aurelius''
* [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] – ''Res Gestae''

===In modern times===
{{History of Italy}}
Interest in studying, and even idealizing, ancient Rome became prevalent during the [[Italian Renaissance]], and continues until the present day. [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Charles Montesquieu]] wrote a work ''Reflections on the Causes of the Grandeur and Declension of the Romans''. The first major work was ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' by [[Edward Gibbon]], which encompassed the Roman civilization from the end of the 2nd century to the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453.&lt;ref name="Gibbon2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, 12 vols.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Montesquieu, Gibbon paid tribute to the virtue of Roman citizens. [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] was a founder of the examination of ancient Roman history and wrote ''The Roman History'', tracing the period until the [[First Punic War|First Punic war]]. Niebuhr tried to determine the way the Roman tradition evolved. According to him, Romans, like other people, had an historical [[ethos]] preserved mainly in the noble families.

During the [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleonic]] period a work titled ''The History of Romans'' by [[Victor Duruy]] appeared. It highlighted the [[Julius Caesar|Caesarean]] period popular at the time. ''[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|History of Rome]]'', ''[[Roman constitutional law]]'' and ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', all by [[Theodor Mommsen]],&lt;ref name="kirjasto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/mommsen.htm |title=Theodor Mommsen |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824083420/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/mommsen.htm |archivedate=24 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; became very important milestones. Later the work ''Greatness and Decline of Rome'' by [[Guglielmo Ferrero]] was published. The Russian work ''Очерки по истории римского землевладения, преимущественно в эпоху Империи'' (''The Outlines on Roman Landownership History, Mainly During the Empire'') by Ivan Grevs contained information on the economy of [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Pomponius Atticus]], one of the largest landowners at the end of the Republic.
* [[Edward Gibbon]] (1737–1794) – ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''
* [[John Bagnall Bury]] (1861–1927) – ''History of the Later Roman Empire''
* [[Michael Grant (author)|Michael Grant]] (1914–2004) – ''The Roman World''&lt;ref&gt;see [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0452008492 excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;
