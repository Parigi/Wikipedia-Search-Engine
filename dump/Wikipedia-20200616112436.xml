'''James Dewey Watson''' [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] (born April 6, 1928) is an American [[molecular biology|molecular biologist]], [[genetics|geneticist]] and [[zoologist]]. In 1953, he co-authored with [[Francis Crick]] the academic paper proposing the [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix structure]] of the [[DNA]] [[molecule]]. Watson, Crick and [[Maurice Wilkins]] were awarded the 1962 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] "for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of [[nucleic acid]]s and its significance for information transfer in living material".

Watson earned degrees at the [[University of Chicago]] ([[Bachelor of Science|BS]], 1947) and [[Indiana University]] ([[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]], 1950). Following a post-doctoral year at the [[University of Copenhagen]] with [[Herman Kalckar]] and Ole Maaløe, Watson worked at the [[University of Cambridge]]'s [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in England, where he first met his future collaborator Francis Crick. From 1956 to 1976, Watson was on the faculty of the [[Harvard University]] Biology Department, promoting research in molecular biology. 

From 1968 Watson served as director of [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] (CSHL), greatly expanding its level of funding and research. At CSHL, he shifted his research emphasis to the study of [[cancer]], along with making it a world-leading research center in molecular biology. In 1994, he started as president and served for 10 years. He was then appointed chancellor, serving until he resigned in 2007 after making comments claiming a genetic link between [[intelligence and race]]. In 2019, following the broadcast of a documentary in which Watson reiterated his views on race and genetics, CSHL revoked his honorary titles and severed all ties with him.

Watson has written many science books, including the textbook ''Molecular Biology of the Gene'' (1965) and his bestselling book ''[[The Double Helix]]'' (1968). Between 1988 and 1992, Watson was associated with the [[National Institutes of Health]], helping to establish the [[Human Genome Project]], which completed the task of mapping the human genome in 2003.

After reading [[Erwin Schrödinger]]'s book, ''[[What Is Life?]]'' in 1946, Watson changed his professional ambitions from the study of ornithology to [[genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Friedberg |first=Errol C. |authorlink= |title=The Writing Life of James D.

In 1947 Watson left the University of Chicago to become a graduate student at [[Indiana University]], attracted by the presence at Bloomington of the 1946 Nobel Prize winner [[Hermann Joseph Muller]], who in crucial papers published in 1922, 1929, and in the 1930s had laid out all the basic properties of the heredity molecule that Schrödinger presented in his 1944 book.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=James|title=In pursuit of the gene : from Darwin to DNA|url=https://archive.org/details/inpursuitofgenef00schw|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree from Indiana University in 1950; [[Salvador Luria]] was his doctoral advisor.&lt;ref name=Cullen/&gt;&lt;ref name="watsonphd"&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=James|last=Watson |title=The Biological Properties of X-Ray Inactivated Bacteriophage |publisher=Indiana University|date=1951 |id={{ProQuest|302021835}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and research==

===Luria, Delbrück, and the Phage Group===
Originally, Watson was drawn into molecular biology by the work of [[Salvador Luria]]. Luria eventually shared the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on the [[Luria–Delbrück experiment]], which concerned the nature of genetic [[mutation]]s. He was part of a distributed group of researchers who were making use of the [[virus]]es that infect [[bacteria]], called [[bacteriophage]]s. He and [[Max Delbrück]] were among the leaders of this new "[[Phage Group]]," an important movement of geneticists from experimental systems such as ''[[Drosophila]]'' towards microbial genetics. Early in 1948, Watson began his PhD research in Luria's laboratory at Indiana University.&lt;ref name="watsonphd"/&gt; That spring, he met Delbrück first in Luria's apartment and again that summer during Watson's first trip to the [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] (CSHL).&lt;ref name=AuthorPage&gt;{{cite book|last2=Berry|first1=James D.|last1=Watson|first2=Andrew|title=DNA : the secret of life|year=2003|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=978-0375415463|url=https://archive.org/details/dnasecretoflife00wats|url-status=dead|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Luria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cshl.edu/gradschool/Non-Research-Faculty/james-d-watson |title=James D.

The Phage Group was the intellectual medium where Watson became a working scientist. Importantly, the members of the Phage Group sensed that they were on the path to discovering the physical nature of the [[gene]]. In 1949, Watson took a course with [[Felix Haurowitz]] that included the conventional view of that time: that genes were [[protein]]s and able to replicate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Putnum |first=Frank W. |authorlink= |editor= |title=Biographical Memoirs – Felix Haurowitz|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=4547&amp;page=144 |accessdate= |edition=volume 64 |series= |year=1994 |publisher=The National Academies Press |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-309-06978-5 |pages=134–163 |quote=Among [Haurowitz's] students was Jim Watson, then a graduate student of Luria.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other major molecular component of [[chromosome]]s, DNA, was widely considered to be a "stupid tetranucleotide," serving only a structural role to support the proteins.&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stewart |first1=Ian |authorlink1=Ian Stewart (mathematician) |title=The Mathematics of Life |url=https://archive.org/details/mathematicslife00stew_563 |url-access=limited |year=2011 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02238-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mathematicslife00stew_563/page/n13 5] |chapter=The structure of DNA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even at this early time, Watson, under the influence of the Phage Group, was aware of the [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment]], which suggested that DNA was the genetic molecule. Watson's research project involved using [[X-ray]]s to inactivate bacterial viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = J.D. | year = 1950 | title = The properties of x-ray inactivated bacteriophage.

Watson then went to [[Copenhagen University]] in September 1950 for a year of postdoctoral research, first heading to the laboratory of biochemist [[Herman Kalckar]].&lt;ref name="The Nobel Foundation"/&gt; Kalckar was interested in the enzymatic synthesis of nucleic acids, and he wanted to use phages as an experimental system. Watson wanted to explore the structure of DNA, and his interests did not coincide with Kalckar's.&lt;ref name="mcelheny"/&gt; After working part of the year with Kalckar, Watson spent the remainder of his time in Copenhagen conducting experiments with microbial physiologist [[Ole Maaløe]], then a member of the Phage Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The experiments, which Watson had learned of during the previous summer's Cold Spring Harbor phage conference, included the use of radioactive phosphate as a tracer to determine which molecular components of phage particles actually infect the target bacteria during viral infection.&lt;ref name="mcelheny"&gt;{{Cite book|last=McElheny |first=Victor K. |title=Watson and DNA: Making a Scientific Revolution |edition= |series= |year=2004 |publisher=Basic Books |location= |language= |isbn=0-7382-0866-3 |page=28 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention was to determine whether protein or DNA was the genetic material, but upon consultation with Max Delbrück,&lt;ref name="mcelheny"/&gt; they determined that their results were inconclusive and could not specifically identify the newly labeled molecules as DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In 1951, the chemist [[Linus Pauling]] in [[California]] published his model of the amino acid [[alpha helix]], a result that grew out of Pauling's efforts in [[X-ray crystallography]] and molecular model building. After obtaining some results from his phage and other experimental research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cshl.edu/R/GNCJKTHBM7E7M3ALB43BLV2SNXC2GKHNKYU5M3HIX5Q985CBKY-00055?func=collections-result&amp;collection_id=1302|title=PDS SSO|publisher=|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted at Indiana University, Statens Serum Institut (Denmark), CSHL, and the [[California Institute of Technology]], Watson now had the desire to learn to perform [[X-ray diffraction]] experiments so he could work to determine the structure of DNA.

===Identifying the double helix===
[[File:DNA Model Crick-Watson.jpg|upright|thumb|DNA model built by Crick and Watson in 1953, on display in the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum, London]]]]

In mid-March 1953, Watson and Crick deduced the [[double helix]] structure of DNA.&lt;ref name="The Nobel Foundation" /&gt; Crucial to their discovery were the experimental data collected at [[King's College London]] &amp;mdash; mainly by [[Rosalind Franklin]], under the supervision of [[Maurice Wilkins]].&lt;ref name="Profile"&gt;{{cite web |title=James Watson, Francis Crick, Maurice Wilkins, and Rosalind Franklin |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/james-watson-francis-crick-maurice-wilkins-and-rosalind-franklin |work=Science History Institute |accessdate=March 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321132408/https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/james-watson-francis-crick-maurice-wilkins-and-rosalind-franklin |archive-date=March 21, 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Lawrence Bragg,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Phillips | first1 = D. | authorlink = David Chilton Phillips| doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1979.0003 | title = William Lawrence Bragg. 31 March 1890-1 July 1971 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 25 | pages = 74–143| year = 1979 | jstor = 769842| pmid =  | pmc = | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; the director of the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] (where Watson and Crick worked), made the original announcement of the discovery at a [[Solvay conference]] on [[protein]]s in Belgium on April 8, 1953; it went unreported by the press. Watson and Crick submitted a paper entitled "[[Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid]]" to the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', which was published on April 25, 1953.&lt;ref name="nobel"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Crick | first2 = F.H. | year = 1953 | title = A structure for deoxyribose nucleic acids | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf | journal = Nature | volume = 171 | issue = 4356| pages = 737–738 | doi = 10.1038/171737a0 | pmid=13054692 | bibcode=1953Natur.171..737W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bragg gave a talk at the [[Guy's Hospital]] Medical School in London on Thursday, May 14, 1953, which resulted in a May 15, 1953, article by [[Peter Ritchie Calder|Ritchie Calder]] in the London newspaper ''[[News Chronicle]]'', entitled "Why You Are You. Nearer Secret of Life."

[[Sydney Brenner]], [[Jack D. Dunitz|Jack Dunitz]], [[Dorothy Hodgkin]], [[Leslie Orgel]], and Beryl M. Oughton were some of the first people in April 1953 to see the model of the structure of [[DNA]], constructed by Crick and Watson; at the time, they were working at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]]'s Chemistry Department. All were impressed by the new DNA model, especially Brenner, who subsequently worked with Crick at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in the Cavendish Laboratory and the new [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]]. According to the late Beryl Oughton, later Rimmer, they all travelled together in two cars once Dorothy Hodgkin announced to them that they were off to Cambridge to see the model of the structure of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Olby|first=Robert|title=Francis Crick : hunter of life's secrets|year=2009|publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press|location=Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-87969-798-3|chapter=10|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cambridge University student newspaper ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]'' also ran its own short article on the discovery on Saturday, May 30, 1953. Watson subsequently presented a paper on the double-helical structure of DNA at the 18th Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Viruses in early June 1953, six weeks after the publication of the Watson and Crick paper in ''Nature''. Many at the meeting had not yet heard of the discovery. The 1953 Cold Spring Harbor Symposium was the first opportunity for many to see the model of the DNA double helix.

Watson, Crick, and Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 for their research on the structure of nucleic acids.&lt;ref name="The Nobel Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Nobel Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimesnobel"&gt;{{cite news| title = No Nobel Prize for Whining | author = Judson, H.F. | date = October 20, 2003 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9C02E4DE123EF933A15753C1A9659C8B63 | newspaper = New York Times | accessdate = August 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NobelLecture&gt;{{cite web|last=Watson|first=James|title=Nobel Lecture December 11, 1962 The Involvement of RNA in the Synthesis of Proteins|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/watson-lecture.html|work=11 December 1962|publisher=Nobelprize.org.

The publication of the double helix structure of DNA has been described as a turning point in science; understanding of life was fundamentally changed and the modern era of biology began.&lt;ref name=60years&gt;{{cite news|last=Rutherford|first=Adam|title=DNA double helix: discovery that led to 60 years of biological revolution|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/apr/25/dna-double-helix-60-years-biological-revolution|accessdate=December 6, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of the King's College results===
Watson and Crick's use of [[Photo 51|DNA X-ray diffraction data]] collected by [[Rosalind Franklin]] and [[Raymond Gosling]] was unauthorized. They used some of her unpublished data—without her consent—in their construction of the double helix model of DNA.&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Judson"&gt;Judson, H.F. 1996. ''The Eighth Day of Creation: Makers of the Revolution in Biology''. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, chapter 3. {{ISBN|0-87969-478-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin's results provided estimates of the water content of DNA crystals and these results were consistent with the two sugar-phosphate backbones being on the outside of the molecule. Franklin told Crick and Watson that the backbones had to be on the outside; before then, Linus Pauling and Watson and Crick had erroneous models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Her identification of the [[space group]] for DNA crystals revealed to Crick that the two DNA strands were [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]].

The X-ray diffraction images collected by Gosling and Franklin provided the best evidence for the helical nature of DNA. Watson and Crick had three sources for Franklin's unpublished data:

According to one critic, Watson's portrayal of Franklin in ''[[The Double Helix]]'' was negative and gave the appearance that she was Wilkins' assistant and was unable to interpret her own DNA data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elkin | first1 = L.O. | year = 2003 | title = Franklin and the Double Helix | url = http://scitation.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&amp;id=PHTOAD000056000003000042000001&amp;idtype=cvips–Rosalind | journal = Physics Today | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | page = 42 | doi = 10.1063/1.1570771 | bibcode = 2003PhT....56c..42E | doi-access = free }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The accusation was indefensible since Franklin told Crick and Watson that the helix backbones had to be on the outside.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A review of the correspondence from Franklin to Watson, in the archives at CSHL, revealed that the two scientists later exchanged constructive scientific correspondence. Franklin consulted with Watson on her tobacco mosaic virus RNA research. Franklin's letters began on friendly terms with "Dear Jim", and concluded with equally benevolent and respectful sentiments such as "Best Wishes, Yours, Rosalind". Each of the scientists published their own unique contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA in separate articles, and all of the contributors published their findings in the same volume of ''Nature''. These classic molecular biology papers are identified as: Watson J.D. and Crick F.H.C. "A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid" ''Nature'' 171, 737–738 (1953);&lt;ref name="nobel"/&gt; Wilkins M.H.F., Stokes A.R. &amp; Wilson, H.R.

===Harvard University===
In 1956, Watson accepted a position in the Biology department at [[Harvard University]]. His work at Harvard focused on RNA and its role in the transfer of genetic information.&lt;ref name=Ladder&gt;{{cite web|title=The DNA molecule is shaped like a twisted ladder|url=http://www.dnaftb.org/19/bio.html|work=DNA from the beginning|publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He championed a switch in focus for the school from [[History of biology|classical biology]] to [[molecular biology]], stating that disciplines such as [[ecology]], [[developmental biology]], [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[physiology]], etc. had stagnated and could progress only once the underlying disciplines of molecular biology and [[biochemistry]] had elucidated their underpinnings, going so far as to discourage their study by students.

Watson continued to be a member of the Harvard faculty until 1976, even though he took over the directorship of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1968.&lt;ref name=Ladder /&gt;

Views on Watson's scientific contributions while at Harvard are somewhat mixed. His most notable achievements in his two decades at Harvard may be what he wrote about science, rather than anything he discovered during that time.&lt;ref name=WatsonWorld&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abir-Am|first=Pnina Geraldine|title=Watson's World|journal=American Scientist|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/watsons-world|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watson's first textbook, ''The Molecular Biology of the Gene'', set a new standard for textbooks, particularly through the use of concept heads—brief declarative subheadings.&lt;ref name=MBOTG&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=J. D.|title=Molecular biology of the gene|year=1965|publisher=W. A. Benjamin|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next textbook was [[Molecular biology of the cell (textbook)|''Molecular Biology of the Cell'']], in which he coordinated the work of a group of scientist-writers. His third textbook was ''Recombinant DNA'', which described the ways in which [[genetic engineering]] has brought much new information about how organisms function. The textbooks are still in print.

===Publishing ''The Double Helix''===

In 1968, Watson wrote ''[[The Double Helix]]'',&lt;ref name=DH&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=J. D.|title=The double helix: a personal account of the discovery of the structure of DNA|year=1968|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; listed by the Board of the [[Modern Library]] as number seven in their list of ''[[Modern Library 100 Best Nonfiction|100 Best Nonfiction]]'' books.&lt;ref name=ModernLibrary&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Best Nonfiction: The Board's List|url=http://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-nonfiction/|publisher=Modern Library|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book details the story of the discovery of the structure of DNA, as well as the personalities, conflicts and controversy surrounding their work, and includes many of his private emotional impressions at the time. Watson's original title was to have been "Honest Jim".&lt;ref name=honest_jim&gt;{{cite news|last=Rutherford|first=Adam|title=He may have unravelled DNA, but James Watson deserves to be shunned|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/01/dna-james-watson-scientist-selling-nobel-prize-medal|date=December 1, 2014|accessdate=October 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some controversy surrounded the publication of the book. Watson's book was originally to be published by the [[Harvard University Press]], but Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins objected, among others. Watson's home university dropped the project and the book was commercially published.&lt;ref&gt;Watson's 1968 autobiographical account, ''[[The Double Helix|The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA]]''. For an edition which contains critical responses, book reviews, and copies of the original scientific papers, see James D. Watson, ''The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA'', Norton Critical Edition, Gunther Stent, ed.

During his tenure at Harvard, Watson participated in a protest against the [[Vietnam War]], leading a group of 12 biologists and biochemists calling for "the immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam."&lt;ref&gt;"Faculty Support Grows For Anti-War Proposal", ''The Harvard Crimson'', October 3, 1969. November 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, on the thirtieth anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima, Watson was one of over 2000 scientists and engineers who spoke out against nuclear proliferation to President [[Gerald Ford]], arguing that there was no proven method for the safe disposal of radioactive waste, and that nuclear plants were a security threat due to the possibility of terrorist theft of plutonium.&lt;ref&gt;"Three Harvard Scientists Lead Call to Stop Nuclear Reactors", ''The Harvard Crimson'', August 5, 1975. November 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory===

In 1968, Watson became the Director of the [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] (CSHL). Between 1970 and 1972, the Watsons' two sons were born, and by 1974, the young family made Cold Spring Harbor their permanent residence. Watson served as the laboratory's director and president for about 35 years, and later he assumed the role of chancellor and then Chancellor Emeritus.

In his roles as director, president, and chancellor, Watson led CSHL to articulate its present-day mission, "dedication to exploring molecular biology and genetics in order to advance the understanding and ability to diagnose and treat cancers, neurological diseases, and other causes of human suffering."&lt;ref name=Cork&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Sullivan |first=Gerald |title=Honorary Doctorate awarded to Nobel Laureate: Text of the Introductory Address |url=http://www.ucc.ie/en/news/newsarchive/2010pressreleases/fullstory-105821-en.html |accessdate=December 5, 2013 |publisher=University College, Cork, Ireland |date=September 8, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206010032/http://www.ucc.ie/en/news/newsarchive/2010pressreleases/fullstory-105821-en.html |archivedate=February 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CSHL substantially expanded both its research and its science educational programs under Watson's direction. He is credited with "transforming a small facility into one of the world's great education and research institutions. Initiating a program to study the cause of human cancer, scientists under his direction have made major contributions to understanding the genetic basis of cancer."&lt;ref name=CSHL /&gt; In a retrospective summary of Watson's accomplishments there, [[Bruce William Stillman|Bruce Stillman]], the laboratory's president, said, "Jim Watson created a research environment that is unparalleled in the world of science."&lt;ref name=CSHL /&gt;

In 2007, Watson said, "I turned against the [[left wing]] because they don't like genetics, because genetics implies that sometimes in life we fail because we have bad genes. They want all failure in life to be due to the evil system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/ESQ0107jameswatson|title=James Watson - Discovery of DNA structure - James Watson on the Double Helix|author=John H.

===Human Genome Project===
[[File:James Dewey Watson.jpg|thumb|Watson in 1992]]
In 1990, Watson was appointed as the Head of the [[Human Genome Project]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]], a position he held until April 10, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/about/almanac/organization/NHGRI.htm|title=National Human Genome Research Institute - Organization - The NIH Almanac - National Institutes of Health (NIH)|publisher=|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watson left the Genome Project after conflicts with the new [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] Director, [[Bernadine Healy]]. Watson was opposed to Healy's attempts to acquire patents on gene sequences, and any ownership of the "laws of nature." Two years before stepping down from the Genome Project, he had stated his own opinion on this long and ongoing controversy which he saw as an illogical barrier to research; he said, "The nations of the world must see that the human genome belongs to the world's people, as opposed to its nations." He left within weeks of the 1992 announcement that the NIH would be applying for patents on brain-specific cDNAs.&lt;ref name="pollack"&gt;[[Robert Pollack (biologist)|Pollack, R.]]. 1994. ''Signs of Life: The Language and Meanings of DNA''.

U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]])

In 1994, Watson became President of [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory|CSHL]]. [[Francis Collins (geneticist)|Francis Collins]] took over the role as Director of the Human Genome Project.

He was quoted in ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' in 1997 as stating: "If you could find the gene which determines sexuality and a woman decides she doesn't want a homosexual child, well, let her."&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, V. "Abort babies with gay genes, says Nobel winner", ''The Telegraph'', February 16, 1997. Retrieved on October 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] wrote a letter to ''The Independent'' claiming that Watson's position was misrepresented by ''The Sunday Telegraph'' article, and that Watson would equally consider the possibility of having a heterosexual child to be just as valid as any other reason for abortion, to emphasise that Watson is in favor of allowing choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Dawkins | first = Richard | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/letter-women-to-decide-on-gay-abortion-1279433.html | title = Letter: Women to decide on gay abortion | newspaper = The Independent | date = February 19, 1997 | accessdate = October 24, 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the issue of obesity, Watson was quoted in 2000, saying: "Whenever you interview fat people, you feel bad, because you know you're not going to hire them."&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;Abate, T. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/11/13/MN111208.DTL "Nobel Winner's Theories Raise Uproar in Berkeley Geneticist's views strike many as racist, sexist"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', November 13, 2000. Retrieved on October 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Watson has repeatedly supported [[Genetic testing|genetic screening]] and [[genetic engineering]] in public lectures and interviews, arguing that stupidity is a disease and the "really stupid" bottom 10% of people should be cured.&lt;ref name="newscientist"&gt;Bhattacharya, S.

===Later life===
In 2014, Watson published a paper in ''[[The Lancet]]'' suggesting that biological [[oxidant]]s may have a different role than is thought in diseases including diabetes, dementia, heart disease and cancer. For example, [[type 2 diabetes]] is usually thought to be caused by oxidation in the body that causes inflammation and kills off pancreatic cells. Watson thinks the root of that inflammation is different: "a lack of biological oxidants, not an excess", and discusses this in detail. One critical response was that the idea was neither new nor worthy of merit, and that ''The Lancet'' published Watson's paper only because of his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/28/dna-pioneer-james-watson-theory-diseases|title=DNA pioneer James Watson sets out radical theory for range of diseases|author=Ian Sample|work=the Guardian|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scientists have expressed their support for his hypothesis and have proposed that it can also be expanded to why a lack of oxidants can result in cancer and its progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Molenaar|first1=RJ|last2=van Noorden|first2=CJ|title=Type 2 diabetes and cancer as redox diseases?|journal=Lancet|date=September 6, 2014|volume=384|issue=9946|page=853|pmid=25209484|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(14)61485-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable former students===
Several of Watson's former doctoral students subsequently became notable in their own right including, [[Mario Capecchi]],&lt;ref name="capecchiphd"/&gt; [[H. Robert Horvitz|Bob Horvitz]], [[Peter Moore (chemist)|Peter B. Moore]] and [[Joan A. Steitz|Joan Steitz]].&lt;ref name=steitz/&gt; Besides numerous PhD students, Watson also supervised postdoctoral students and other interns including [[Ewan Birney]],&lt;ref name="thescientist"/&gt; [[Ronald W.

===Other affiliations===
Watson is a former member of the Board of Directors of United Biomedical, Inc., founded by [[Chang Yi Wang]].

===''Avoid Boring People''===
[[File:JDWatson 2007-04-30.jpg|right|thumb|Watson signing autographs after a speech at [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] on April 30, 2007]]
Watson has had disagreements with [[Craig Venter]] regarding his use of [[Expressed sequence tag|EST]] fragments while Venter worked at [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]]. Venter went on to found [[Celera]] genomics and continued his feud with Watson. Watson was quoted as calling Venter "Hitler".&lt;ref&gt;Shreeve. J. 2005. ''The Genome War: How Craig Venter Tried to Capture the Code of Life and Save the World''. Ballantine Books, p. 48. {{ISBN|0-345-43374-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his memoir, ''Avoid Boring People: Lessons from a Life in Science'', Watson describes his academic colleagues as "dinosaurs," "deadbeats," "fossils," "has-beens," "mediocre," and "vapid." [[Steve Shapin]] in ''[[Harvard Magazine]]'' noted that Watson had written an unlikely "Book of Manners," telling about the skills needed at different times in a scientist's career; he wrote Watson was known for aggressively pursuing his own goals at the university. [[E. O. Wilson]] once described Watson as "the most unpleasant human being I had ever met", but in a later TV interview said that he considered them friends and their rivalry at Harvard old history (when they had competed for funding in their respective fields).&lt;ref name="harv"&gt;"[http://harvardmagazine.com/2008/01/chairman-of-the-bored.html Chairman of the Bored]", Steven Shapin, ''Harvard Magazine'', January–February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="charlierose"&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6927851714963534233 Charlie Rose Interview, paired with E.

In the epilogue to the memoir ''Avoid Boring People'', Watson alternately attacks and defends former Harvard University president [[Lawrence Summers]], who stepped down in 2006 due in part to his remarks about women and science. Watson also states in the epilogue, "Anyone sincerely interested in understanding the imbalance in the representation of men and women in science must reasonably be prepared at least to consider the extent to which nature may figure, even with the clear evidence that nurture is strongly implicated."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

===Comments on race ===
At a conference in 2000, Watson suggested a link between skin color and sex drive, hypothesizing that dark-skinned people have stronger [[libidos]].&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="British Medical Journal - Melanotan"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = C. | last2 = Berger | first2 = A. | year = 2000 | title = Agent provocateur pursues happiness | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/321/7252/12 | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 321 | issue = 7252| page = 12 | pmid = 10875824 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.321.7252.12 | pmc = 1127681 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His lecture argued that extracts of [[melanin]] – which gives skin its color – had been found to boost subjects' sex drive. "That's why you have Latin lovers," he said, according to people who attended the lecture. "You've never heard of an English lover. Only an [[The English Patient|English Patient]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/WireStory?id=3743042&amp;page=1 |title=UK Museum Cancels Scientist's Lecture |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=October 17, 2007 |accessdate=May 28, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628201051/http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/WireStory?id=3743042&amp;page=1 |archivedate=June 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also said that stereotypes associated with racial and ethnic groups have a genetic basis: Jews being intelligent, Chinese being intelligent but not creative because of selection for conformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Reich |first=David. |authorlink= |editor= |title=Who We Are and How We Got Here |year=2019 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-882125-0|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;
