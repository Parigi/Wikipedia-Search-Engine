Their underlying causes are extremely variable and complicated by various genetic and/or environmental factors. These diseases cause progressive deterioration of the neuron resulting in decreased [[signal transduction]] and in some cases even neuronal death. Peripheral nervous system (PNS) diseases may be further categorized by the type of nerve cell ([[Motor neuron|motor]], [[Sensory neuron|sensory]], or both) affected by the disorder. Effective treatment of these diseases is often prevented by lack of understanding of the underlying molecular and genetic pathology. [[Epigenetic therapy]] is being investigated as a method of correcting the expression levels of misregulated genes in neurodegenerative diseases.

[[Motor neuron disease|Neurodengenerative diseases of motor neurons]] can cause degeneration of motor neurons involved in voluntary muscle control such as muscle contraction and relaxation.  This article will cover the epigenetics and treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). See the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140413093035/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/motor_neuron_diseases/detail_motor_neuron_diseases.htm Motor Neuron Fact Sheet] for details regarding other motor neuron diseases.[[Neurodegeneration|Neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system]] can affect the brain and/or [[spinal cord]]. This article will cover the epigenetics and treatment of [[Alzheimer’s disease]] (AD), [[Huntington’s disease]] (HD), and [[Parkinson’s disease]] (PD).  These diseases are characterized by chronic and progressive neuronal dysfunction, sometimes leading to behavioral abnormalities (as with PD), and, ultimately, neuronal death, resulting in [[dementia]].

Neurodegenerative diseases of sensory neurons can cause degeneration of sensory neurons involved in transmitting sensory information such as [[hearing]] and [[Visual perception|seeing]]. The main group of sensory neuron diseases are hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN) such as [[HSAN I]], [[HSAN II]], and [[Charcot-Marie-Tooth]] Type 2B (CMT2B).&lt;ref&gt;{{OMIM| 600882|Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, Axonal, Type 2B; CMT2B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Sghirlanzoni_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sghirlanzoni A, Pareyson D, Lauria G | title = Sensory neuron diseases | journal = The Lancet.

== Epigenetics and epigenetic drugs ==
[[Image:Diagram human cell nucleus.svg|thumb|350px|The nucleus of a human cell showing the location of euchromatin]]
The term [[epigenetics]] refers to three levels of gene regulation: (1) [[DNA methylation]], (2) [[histone modification]]s, and (3) [[non-coding RNA]] (ncRNA) function.  Briefly, histone-mediated transcriptional control occurs by the wrapping of DNA around a [[histone]] core.  This DNA-histone structure is called a [[nucleosome]]; the more tightly the DNA is bound by the nucleosome, and the more tightly a string of nucleosomes are compressed among each other, the greater the repressive effect on [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of genes in the DNA sequences near or wrapped around the histones, and vice versa (i.e. looser DNA binding and relaxed compaction leads to a comparatively derepressed state, resulting in facultative [[heterochromatin]] or, even further derepressed, [[euchromatin]]).  At its most repressive state, involving many folds into itself and other scaffolding proteins, DNA-histone structures form constitutive heterochromatin.  This chromatin structure is mediated by these three levels of gene regulation. The most relevant epigenetic modifications to treatment of neurodegenerative diseases are DNA methylation and histone protein modifications via methylation or acetylation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goll MG, Bestor TH | title = Eukaryotic cytosine methyltransferases | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 481–514 | date = 2005 | pmid = 15952895 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.74.010904.153721 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Bernstein_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernstein BE, Meissner A, Lander ES | title = The mammalian epigenome | journal = Cell | volume = 128 | issue = 4 | pages = 669–81 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17320505 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.01.033 | department = review }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In mammals, [[Methylation#Epigenetics|methylation]] occurs on DNA and histone proteins. [[DNA methylation]] occurs on the cytosine of [[CpG site|CpG dinucleotides]] in the genomic sequence, and protein methylation occurs on the amino termini of the core histone proteins - most commonly on lysine residues.&lt;ref name = "Bernstein_2007" /&gt; CpG refers to a dinucleotide composed of a cytosine deoxynucleotide immediately adjacent to a guanine deoxynucleotide.  A cluster of CpG dinucleotides clustered together is called a [[CpG site#CpG islands|CpG island]], and in mammals, these CpG islands are one of the major classes of gene promoters, onto or around which transcription factors may bind and transcription can begin.  Methylation of CpG dinucleotides and/or islands within gene promoters is associated with transcriptional repression via interference of [[transcription factor]] binding and recruitment of transcriptional repressors with methyl binding domains. Methylation of [[Intron|intragenic regions]] is associated with increased transcription. The group of enzymes responsible for addition of methyl groups to DNA are called [[DNA methyltransferase]]s (DNMTs). The enzyme responsible for removal of methyl group are called DNA demethylases. The effects of [[histone methylation]] are residue dependent (e.g. which amino acid on which histone tail is methylated) therefore the resulting transcriptional activity and [[Histone#Chromatin regulation|chromatin regulation]] can vary.&lt;ref name = "Bernstein_2007" /&gt; The enzymes responsible for the addition of methyl groups to histones are called [[histone methyltransferases]] (HMTs). The enzymes responsible for the removal of methyl groups from histone are [[Demethylase|histone demethylases]].
*[[Histone acetylation and deacetylation|Acetylation]] occurs on the lysine residues found at the amino N-terminal of histone tails. Histone acetylation is most commonly associated with relaxed chromatin, transcriptional derepression, and thus actively transcribed genes.&lt;ref name = "Bernstein_2007" /&gt; [[Histone acetyltransferases]] (HATs) are enzymes responsible for the addition of acetyl groups, and [[histone deacetylase]]s (HDACs) are enzymes responsible for the removal of acetyl groups.  Therefore, the addition or removal of an acetyl group to a histone can alter the expression of nearby genes. The majority of drugs being investigated are inhibitors of proteins that remove acetyl from histones or histone deacetylases (HDACs).
*Briefly, [[Non-coding RNA|ncRNAs]] are involved in signaling cascades with epigenetic marking enzymes such as HMTs, and/or with [[RNA interference]](RNAi) machinery.  Frequently these signaling cascades result in epigenetic repression (for one example, see [[X-inactivation|X-chromosome inactivation]]), though there are some cases in which the opposite is true.  For example, ''[[BACE1-AS]]'' ncRNA expression is upregulated in Alzheimer's disease patients and results in increased stability of ''[[BACE1]]'' - the mRNA precursor to an enzyme involved in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name="Faghihi_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Faghihi MA, Modarresi F, Khalil AM, Wood DE, Sahagan BG, Morgan TE, Finch CE, St Laurent G, Kenny PJ, Wahlestedt C | title = Expression of a noncoding RNA is elevated in Alzheimer's disease and drives rapid feed-forward regulation of beta-secretase | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 7 | pages = 723–30 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18587408 | pmc = 2826895 | doi = 10.1038/nm1784 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epigenetic drugs target the proteins responsible for modifications on DNA or histone. Current epigenetic drugs include but are not limited to: [[Histone deacetylase inhibitor|HDAC inhibitors]] (HDACi), HAT modulators, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, and histone demethylase inhibitors.&lt;ref name = "Urdinguio_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Urdinguio RG, Sanchez-Mut JV, Esteller M | title = Epigenetic mechanisms in neurological diseases: genes, syndromes, and therapies | journal = The Lancet.

While the majority of epigenetic drug treatments have been conducted in mouse models, some experiments have been performed on human cells as well as in human drug trials (see table below). There are inherent risks in using epigenetic drugs as therapies for neurodegenerative disorders as some epigenetic drugs (e.g. HDACis such as [[sodium butyrate]]) are non-specific in their targets, which leaves potential for off-target epigenetic marks causing unwanted epigenetic modifications.

==Neurodegenerative diseases of motor neurons==

===Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)===
{{main|Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis}}

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a motor neuron disease that involves neurogeneration. All skeletal muscles in the body are controlled by motor neurons that communicate signals from the brain to the muscle through a [[neuromuscular junction]]. When the motor neurons degenerate, the muscles no longer receive signals from the brain and begin to waste away. ALS is characterized by stiff muscles, muscle twitching, and progressive muscle weakness from muscle wasting. The parts of the body affected by early symptoms of ALS depend on which motor neurons in the body are damaged first, usually the limbs. As the disease progresses most patients are unable to walk or use their arms and eventually develop difficulty speaking, swallowing and breathing. Most patients retain cognitive function and sensory neurons are generally unaffected. Patients are often diagnosed after the age of 40 and the median survival time from onset to death is around 3–4 years. In the final stages, patients can lose voluntary control of eye muscles and often die of [[respiratory failure]] or [[pneumonia]] as a result of degeneration of the motor neurons and muscles required for breathing. Currently there is no cure for ALS, only treatments that may prolong life.

==== Genetics and underlying causes ====

To date, multiple genes and proteins have been implicated in ALS. One of the common themes between many of these genes and their causative mutations is the presence of [[Protein aggregation|protein aggregates]] in motor neurons.&lt;ref name = "Dewey_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dewey CM, Cenik B, Sephton CF, Johnson BA, Herz J, Yu G | title = TDP-43 aggregation in neurodegeneration: are stress granules the key? | journal = Brain Research | volume = 1462 | issue = | pages = 16–25 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22405725 | pmc = 3372581 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainres.2012.02.032 | department = review }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common molecular features in ALS patients are altered RNA metabolism&lt;ref name = "Polymenidou_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Polymenidou M, Lagier-Tourenne C, Hutt KR, Bennett CF, Cleveland DW, Yeo GW | title = Misregulated RNA processing in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis | journal = Brain Research | volume = 1462 | issue = | pages = 3–15 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22444279 | pmc = 3707312 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainres.2012.02.059 | department = review }}&lt;/ref&gt; and general histone hypoacetylation.&lt;ref name="Rouaux_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rouaux C, Jokic N, Mbebi C, Boutillier S, Loeffler JP, Boutillier AL | title = Critical loss of CBP/p300 histone acetylase activity by caspase-6 during neurodegeneration | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 22 | issue = 24 | pages = 6537–49 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14657026 | pmc = 291810 | doi = 10.1093/emboj/cdg615 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) ===
{{main|Spinal muscular atrophy}}
[[file:Gray642.png|thumb|Alpha motor neurons are derived from the [[basal plate (neural tube)|basal plate]] (basal lamina).]]
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive motor neuron disease caused by mutations in the [[SMN1]] gene.&lt;ref name="Brzustowicz_1990"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brzustowicz LM, Lehner T, Castilla LH, Penchaszadeh GK, Wilhelmsen KC, Daniels R, Davies KE, Leppert M, Ziter F, Wood D | title = Genetic mapping of chronic childhood-onset spinal muscular atrophy to chromosome 5q11.2-13.3 | journal = Nature | volume = 344 | issue = 6266 | pages = 540–1 | date = April 1990 | pmid = 2320125 | doi = 10.1038/344540a0 | department = primary | bibcode = 1990Natur.344..540B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms vary greatly with each subset of SMA and the stage of the disease. General symptoms include overall muscle weakness and poor muscle tone including extremities and respiratory muscles leading to difficulty walking, breathing, and feeding. Depending on the type of SMA, the disease can present itself from infancy through adulthood. As SMN protein generally promotes the survival of motor neurons, mutations in SMN1 results in slow degeneration motor neurons leading to progressive system-wide muscle wasting. Specifically, over time, decreased levels of SMN protein results in gradual death of the [[alpha motor neuron]]s in the [[Anterior grey column|anterior horn of the spinal cord]] and brain. Muscles depend on connections to motor neurons and the central nervous system to stimulate muscle maintenance and therefore degeneration of motor neurons and subsequent denervation of muscles lead to loss of muscle control and muscle atrophy. The muscles of the lower extremities are often affected first followed by upper extremities and sometimes the muscles of respiration and mastication. In general, proximal muscle is always affected more than distal muscle.

==== Genetic cause ====

Spinal muscular atrophy is linked to genetic mutations in the SMN1 (Survival of Motor Neuron 1) gene. The SMN protein is widely expressed in neurons and serves many functions within neurons including [[spliceosome]] construction, mRNA axon transport, [[neurite]] outgrowth during development, and [[neuromuscular junction]] formation. The causal function loss in SMA is currently unknown.

SMN1 is located in a [[Telomere|telomeric]] region of [[Chromosome 5 (human)|human chromosome 5]] and also contains SMN2 in a [[Centromere|centromeric]] region. SMN1 and [[SMN2]] are nearly identical except for a single [[Nucleotide|nucleotide change]] in SMN2 resulting in an alternative splicing site where intron 6 meets exon 8. This single base pair change leads to only 10-20% of SMN2 transcripts resulting in fully functional SMN protein and 80-90% of transcripts leading to a truncated protein that is rapidly degraded. Most SMA patients have 2 or more copies of the SMN2 gene with more copies resulting in a decrease in disease severity.&lt;ref name="Prior_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prior TW, Krainer AR, Hua Y, Swoboda KJ, Snyder PC, Bridgeman SJ, Burghes AH, Kissel JT | title = A positive modifier of spinal muscular atrophy in the SMN2 gene | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 85 | issue = 3 | pages = 408–13 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19716110 | pmc = 2771537 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.08.002 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most SMA patients have either [[point mutation]]s or a deletion in exon 7 often leading to a protein product similar to the truncated and degraded version of the SMN2 protein. In SMA patients this small amount of functional SMN2 protein product allows for some neurons to survive.

==== Epigenetic treatment through SMN2 gene activation ====

Although SMA is not caused by an epigenetic mechanism, therapeutic drugs that target epigenetic marks may provide SMA patients with some relief, halting or even reversing the progression of the disease. As SMA patients with higher copy numbers of the SMN2 gene have less severe symptoms, researchers predicted that epigenetic drugs that increased SMN2 mRNA expression would increase the amount of functional SMN protein in neurons leading to a reduction in SMA symptoms. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are the main compounds that have been tested to increase SMN2 mRNA expression. Inhibiting HDACs would allow for hyperacetylation of the SMN2 gene loci theoretically resulting in an increase in SMN2 expression.&lt;ref name="Kernochan_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kernochan LE, Russo ML, Woodling NS, Huynh TN, Avila AM, Fischbeck KH, Sumner CJ | title = The role of histone acetylation in SMN gene expression | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 14 | issue = 9 | pages = 1171–82 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15772088 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddi130 | department = primary | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) are first tested in mouse models of SMA created through a variety of mutations in the mouse SMN1 gene. If the mice show improvement and the drug does not cause very many side effects or toxicity, the drug may be used in human clinical trials. Human trials with all of the below HDAC inhibitors are extremely variable and often impacted by the patient's exact SMA subtype.

===Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)===
{{main|Alzheimer’s Disease}}

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia among the elderly.  The disease is characterized behaviorally by chronic and progressive decline in cognitive function, beginning with short term memory loss, and neurologically by buildup of misfolded [[tau protein]] and associated [[Tauopathy|neurofibrillary tangles]], and by amyloid-beta senile plaques [[Amyloid beta|amyloid-beta senile plaques]].  Several genetic factors have been identified as contributing to AD, including mutations to the [[Amyloid precursor protein|''amyloid precursor protein'' (''APP'')]] and [[Presenilin|''presenilins 1 and 2'']] genes, and familial inheritance of ''[[apolipoprotein E]]'' allele epsilon 4.  In addition to these common factors, there are a number of other genes that have shown altered expression in Alzheimer's disease, some of which are associated with epigenetic factors.

==== Epigenetic factors ====
[[file:Brain-derived neurotrophic factor - PDB id 1BND.png|thumb|250 px|Brain-derived neurotrophic factor]]
;ncRNA: ncRNA that is encoded antisense from an intron within the beta-amyloid cleaving enzyme gene, [[Beta-secretase 1|''BACE1,'']] is involved in AD.&lt;ref name="Faghihi_2008" /&gt;  This ncRNA, ''[[BACE1-AS]]'' (for antisense), which overlaps exon 6 of ''BACE1'', is involved in increasing the stability of the ''BACE1'' mRNA transcript.  As that gene's name suggests, BACE1 is an enzymatic protein that cleaves the Amyloid Precursor Protein into the insoluble amyloid beta form, which then aggregates into senile plaques.  With increased stability of ''BACE1'' mRNA resulting from ''BACE1-AS'', more ''BACE1'' mRNA is available for translation into BACE1 protein.
;miRNA: factors have not consistently been shown to play a role in progression of AD.  miRNAs are involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing via inhibiting translation or involvement in [[RNA interference|RNAi]] pathways. Some studies have shown upregulation of miRNA-146a, which differentially regulates neuroimmune-related Interleukin-1R associated kinases IRAK1 and IRAK2 expression, in human AD brain, while other studies have shown upregulation or downregulation of miRNA-9 in brain.&lt;ref name = "Bennett_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bennett DA, Yu L, Yang J, Srivastava GP, Aubin C, De Jager PL | title = Epigenomics of Alzheimer's disease | journal = Translational Research | volume = 165 | issue = 1 | pages = 200–20 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 24905038 | pmc = 4233194 | doi = 10.1016/j.trsl.2014.05.006 | department = review }}&lt;/ref&gt;
;DNA methylation: In Alzheimer’s disease cases, global DNA hypomethylation and gene-specific hypermethylation has been observed, though findings have varied between studies, especially in studies of human brains.  Hypothetically, global hypomethylation should be associated with global increases in transcription, since CpG islands are most prevalent in gene promoters; gene-specific hypermethylation, however, would indicate that these hypermethylated genes are repressed by the methylation marks.  Generally, repressive hypermethylation of genes related to learning and memory has been observed in conjunction with derepressive hypomethylation of neuroinflammatory genes and genes related to pathological expression of Alzheimer's disease. Reduced methylation has been found in the long-term memory-associated temporal neocortex neurons in monozygotic twins with Alzheimer’s disease compared to the healthy twin.&lt;ref name="Mastroeni_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mastroeni D, McKee A, Grover A, Rogers J, Coleman PD | title = Epigenetic differences in cortical neurons from a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for Alzheimer's disease | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 8 | pages = e6617 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19672297 | pmc = 2719870 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0006617 | department = primary | bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.6617M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Global hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides has also been observed in hippocampus&lt;ref name="Chouliaras_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chouliaras L, Mastroeni D, Delvaux E, Grover A, Kenis G, Hof PR, Steinbusch HW, Coleman PD, Rutten BP, van den Hove DL | title = Consistent decrease in global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease patients | journal = Neurobiology of Aging | volume = 34 | issue = 9 | pages = 2091–9 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23582657 | pmc = 3955118 | doi = 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2013.02.021 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in entorhinal cortex layer II&lt;ref name="Mastroeni_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mastroeni D, Grover A, Delvaux E, Whiteside C, Coleman PD, Rogers J | title = Epigenetic changes in Alzheimer's disease: decrements in DNA methylation | journal = Neurobiology of Aging | volume = 31 | issue = 12 | pages = 2025–37 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 19117641 | pmc = 2962691 | doi = 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2008.12.005 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt; of human AD patients, both of which are susceptible to AD pathology.

==== Treatments ====
Treatment for prevention or management of Alzheimer's disease has proven troublesome since the disease is chronic and progressive, and many epigenetic drugs act globally and not in a gene-specific manner.  As with other potential treatments to [[Alzheimer's disease#Prevention|prevent]] or [[Alzheimer's disease#Management|ameliorate]] symptoms of AD, these therapies do not work to cure, but only ameliorate symptoms of the disease temporarily, underscoring the chronic, progressive nature of AD, and the variability of methylation in AD brains.

;Folate and other B vitamins: B vitamins are involved in the metabolic pathway that leads to SAM production.  SAM is the donor of the methyl group utilized by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) to methylate CpGs.  Using animal models, Fuso et al. have demonstrated restoration of methylation at previously hypomethylated promoters of ''presenilin 1'', ''BACE1'' and ''APP''&lt;ref name="Fuso_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fuso A | title = The 'golden age' of DNA methylation in neurodegenerative diseases | journal = Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 523–34 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23183753 | doi = 10.1515/cclm-2012-0618 | department = review }}&lt;/ref&gt; - a hypothetically stable epigenetic modification that should repress those genes and slow the progression of AD.

==== HDAC inhibitors ====

Huntington patients and both mouse and Drosophila models show histone H3 and H4 hypoacetylation.  There are currently no treatments for the disease but numerous HDAC inhibitors have been tested and shown to reverse the certain symptoms caused by the Htt mutation.

===Parkinson's Disease (PD)===
{{main|Parkinson's disease}}
[[File:Lewy Koerperchen.JPG|100 px|thumb|Lewy bodies]]
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra by causes unknown.  Several genes and environmental factors (e.g. pesticide exposure) may play a role in onset of PD.  Hallmarks include mutations to the alpha-synuclein gene, [[Alpha-synuclein#Clinical significance|''SNCA'']], as well as ''PARK2'', ''PINK1'', ''UCHL1'', ''DJ1'', and ''LRRK2'' genes, and fibrillar accumulation of [[Dementia with Lewy bodies|Lewy bodies]] from misfolded alpha-synuclein. Symptoms are most noticeably manifested in disorders of movement, including shaking, rigidity, deficits in making controlled movements, and slow and difficult walking.  The late stages of the disease result in dementia and depression. Levodopa and dopaminergic therapy may ameliorate symptoms, though there is no treatment to halt progression of the disease.

==== Treatments ====

Epigenetic treatments tested in models of PD are few, though some promising research has been conducted.  Most treatments investigated thus far are directed at histone modifications and analysis of their roles in mediating alpha-synuclein expression and activity.  Pesticides and paraquat increase histone acetylation, producing neurotoxic effects similar to those seen in PD, such as apoptosis of dopaminergic cells.&lt;ref name="Song_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Song C, Kanthasamy A, Jin H, Anantharam V, Kanthasamy AG | title = Paraquat induces epigenetic changes by promoting histone acetylation in cell culture models of dopaminergic degeneration | journal = Neurotoxicology | volume = 32 | issue = 5 | pages = 586–95 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21777615 | pmc = 3407036 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuro.2011.05.018 | department = primary }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, treatment with HDACis&lt;ref name = "Harrison_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harrison IF, Dexter DT | title = Epigenetic targeting of histone deacetylase: therapeutic potential in Parkinson's disease? | journal = Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics | volume = 140 | issue = 1 | pages = 34–52 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23711791 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2013.05.010 | department = review }}&lt;/ref&gt; seems to have a neuroprotective effect.
