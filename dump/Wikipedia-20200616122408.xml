'''Photovoltaics''' ('''PV''') is the conversion of light into electricity using [[semiconducting material]]s that exhibit the [[photovoltaic effect]], a phenomenon studied in [[physics]], [[photochemistry]], and [[electrochemistry]].

PV has become the cheapest source of electrical power in regions with a high [https://globalsolaratlas.info solar potential], with price bids as low as 0.01567 US$/[[kWh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=KAHRAMAA and Siraj Energy Sign Agreements for Al-Kharsaah Solar PV Power Plant |url=https://www.km.qa/MediaCenter/pages/NewsDetails.aspx?ItemID=330 |publisher=Qatar General Electricity &amp; Water Corporation “KAHRAMAA” |accessdate=26 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2020. Panel prices have dropped by the factor of 10 within a decade. This competitiveness opens the path to a global transition to [[sustainable energy]] which would be required help to mitigate [[global warming]]. The situation is urgent: The [[emissions budget]] for {{CO2}} to meet the [[SR15|1.5 degree target]] would be used up in 2028 if emissions remain on the current level. However, the use of PV as a main source requires [[energy storage]] systems or global distribution by [[high-voltage direct current]] power lines causing additional costs.

A  [[photovoltaic system]] employs [[solar module]]s, each comprising a number of [[solar cell]]s, which generate electrical power.  PV installations may be ground-mounted, rooftop mounted, wall mounted or floating.  The mount may be fixed or use a [[solar tracker]] to follow the sun across the sky.

Solar PV has specific advantages as an energy source: once installed, its operation generates no pollution and no [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]], it shows simple scalability in respect of power needs and silicon has large availability in the Earth's crust.&lt;ref name=Mayumi2017&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Samuele |last1=Lo Piano |first2= Kozo |last2=Mayumi  |title= Toward an integrated assessment of the performance of photovoltaic systems for electricity generation |journal=[[Applied Energy]] |volume=186 |issue=2 |pages=167–74 |year=2017 |doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photovoltaic systems have long been used in specialized applications as stand-alone installations and [[grid-connected PV system]]s have been in use since the 1990s.&lt;ref name=reconsidering /&gt; Photovoltaic modules were first mass-produced in 2000, when German environmentalists and the [[Eurosolar]] organization got government funding for a ten thousand roof program.&lt;ref name="Solar Power for the World: What You Wanted to Know about Photovoltaics"&gt;{{cite book|author=Palz, Wolfgang |title=Solar Power for the World: What You Wanted to Know about Photovoltaics|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=qGXvAgAAQBAJ|page=131}} |date= 2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-981-4411-87-5|pages=131–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Net metering]] and financial incentives, such as preferential [[feed-in tariff]]s for solar-generated electricity, have supported solar PV installations in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st century (REN21), [http://www.ren21.net/REN21Activities/GlobalStatusReport.aspx Renewables 2010 Global Status Report], Paris, 2010, pp. 1–80.&lt;/ref&gt; More than [[Solar power by country|100 countries]] now use solar PV.

After [[Hydroelectricity|hydro]] and [[wind power]]s, PV is the third renewable energy source in terms of global capacity. The [[International Energy Agency]] expects a growth by 700 - 880 GW from 2019 to 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Renewables 2019 |url=https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2019 |publisher=IEA |accessdate=26 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the forecast, PV could become the technology with the largest installed capacity by the mid 2020s.

In 2018, worldwide installed PV capacity increased to more than 515 [[gigawatts]] (GW) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PV report 2019 |url=https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/ise/de/documents/publications/studies/Photovoltaics-Report.pdf |publisher=Fraunhofer ISE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The term "photovoltaic" comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] φῶς (''phōs'') meaning "light", and from "volt", the unit of electromotive force, the [[volt]], which in turn comes from the last name of the [[Italian people|Italian]] physicist [[Alessandro Volta]], inventor of the battery ([[electrochemical cell]]). The term "photovoltaic" has been in use in English since 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Elements of electro-biology,: or the voltaic mechanism of man; of electro-pathology, especially of the nervous system; and of electro-therapeutics|author = Smee, Alfred |publisher = London: Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans|page=15|year = 1849|url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=CU0EAAAAQAAJ|page=15}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar cells produce direct current electricity from sunlight which can be used to power equipment or to [[Rechargeable battery|recharge a battery]]. The first practical application of photovoltaics was to power orbiting satellites and other [[spacecraft]], but today the majority of [[photovoltaic module]]s are used for grid-connected systems for power generation. In this case an [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] is required to convert the DC to AC.

Solar photovoltaic power generation has long been seen as a [[clean energy]] technology which draws upon the planet's most plentiful and widely distributed renewable energy source – the sun.  Cells require protection from the environment and are usually packaged tightly in solar modules.

== Current developments ==

For best performance, terrestrial PV systems aim to maximize the time they face the sun. [[Solar tracker]]s achieve this by moving PV modules to follow the sun. The increase can be by as much as 20% in winter and by as much as 50% in summer. Static mounted systems can be optimized by analysis of the [[sun path]]. PV modules are often set to latitude tilt, an angle equal to the latitude, but performance can be improved by adjusting the angle for summer or winter. Generally, as with other semiconductor devices, temperatures above room temperature reduce the performance of photovoltaic modules.&lt;ref&gt;Vick, B.D., Clark, R.N. (2005). [http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/Publications.htm?seq_no_115=182692 Effect of module temperature on a Solar-PV AC water pumping system], pp. 159–164 in: Proceedings of the International Solar Energy Society (ISES) 2005 Solar Water Congress: Bringing water to the World, 8–12 August 2005, Orlando, Florida.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of solar modules may also be mounted vertically above each other in a tower, if the [[zenith distance]] of the [[Sun]] is greater than zero, and the tower can be turned horizontally as a whole and each module additionally around a horizontal axis. In such a tower the modules can follow the Sun exactly. Such a device may be described as a [[Turntable ladder#Turntable ladder|ladder]] mounted on a turnable disk. Each step of that ladder is the middle axis of a rectangular [[solar panel]]. In case the zenith distance of the Sun reaches zero, the "ladder" may be rotated to the north or the south to avoid a solar module producing a shadow on a lower one. Instead of an exactly vertical tower one can choose a tower with an axis directed to the [[polar star]], meaning that it is parallel to the rotation axis of the [[Earth]]. In this case the angle between the axis and the Sun is always larger than 66 degrees. During a day it is only necessary to turn the panels around this axis to follow the Sun. Installations may be ground-mounted (and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing)&lt;ref name="huliq.com"&gt;[http://www.huliq.com/18313/ge-invests-delivers-one-of-worlds-largest-solar-power-plants GE Invests, Delivers One of World's Largest Solar Power Plants].

Another recent development involves the material content of solar cells. University labs at Oxford, Stanford, and elsewhere are experimenting with replacing [[crystalline silicon]] in photovoltaic solar cells with [[perovskite]], a mineral with semiconductor properties. Researchers at these labs have quickly achieved cell efficiencies of 20-25%, matching or exceeding those of silicon solar cells.&lt;ref name="NREL"&gt;[https://www.nrel.gov/pv/cell-efficiency.html Best Research Cell Efficiences]. nrel.gov (16 September 2019).

=== Efficiency ===
{{Main|Solar cell efficiency}}
[[File:Best Research-Cell Efficiencies.png|thumb|280px|Best Research-Cell Efficiencies]]

The electrical efficiency of a PV cell is a [[physical property]] which represents how much electrical power a cell can produce for a given [[Solar irradiance]]. The basic expression for maximum efficiency of a photovoltaic cell is given by the ratio of output power to the incident solar power (radiation flux times area)

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{P_{max}}{E \cdot A_{cell}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pvpower.com/assets/Measuring-PV-Efficiency-Solar-Panels.pdf Measuring PV Efficiency]. pvpower.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The efficiency is measured under ideal laboratory conditions and represents the maximum achievable efficiency of the PV cell or module. Actual efficiency is influenced by temperature, irradiance and spectrum.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The most efficient type of solar cell to date is a multi-junction concentrator solar cell with an efficiency of 46.0%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frank|first1=Dimroth|title=New world record for solar cell efficiency at 46% French-German cooperation confirms competitive advantage of European photovoltaic industry|url=https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/press-and-media/press-releases/press-releases-2014/new-world-record-for-solar-cell-efficiency-at-46-percent|publisher=Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft|accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced by [[Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE|Fraunhofer ISE]] in December 2014. The highest efficiencies achieved without concentration include a material by [[Sharp Corporation]] at 35.8% using a proprietary triple-junction manufacturing technology in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news175452895.html Sharp Develops Solar Cell with World's Highest Conversion Efficiency of 35.8%].

The US-based specialty [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) PV manufacturer [[Alta Devices]] produces commercial cells with 26% efficiency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.altadevices.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Alta-Corporate-Brochure.pdf|title=Alta Devices product solar cell|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming to have "the world's most efficient solar" single-junction cell dedicated to flexible and lightweight applications. For Silicon solar cell, the US company [[SunPower]] remains the leader with a certified module efficiency of 22.8%,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://us.sunpower.com/blog/2015/10/08/sunpower-offers-customers-most-efficient-solar-panels-commercially-available-today|title=SunPower is manufacturing solar panels verified at 22.8 percent efficiency|last=|first=|date=8 October 2015|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; well above the market average of 15–18%. However, competitor companies are catching up like the South Korean conglomerate [[LG Corporation|LG]] (21.7% efficiency&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lg.com/us/business/solar-panels/lg-lg375a1c-v5|title=LG 21.7% module efficiency|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or the Norwegian [[Renewable Energy Corporation|REC Group]] (21.7% efficiency).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.recgroup.com/sites/default/files/documents/ds_rec_alpha_series_rev_c_iec_en_web.pdf|title=REC 380AA 21.7% module efficiency|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an ongoing effort to increase the conversion efficiency of PV cells and modules, primarily for competitive advantage. In order to increase the efficiency of solar cells, it is important to choose a semiconductor material with an appropriate [[band gap]] that matches the solar spectrum. This will enhance the electrical and optical properties. Improving the method of charge collection is also useful for increasing the efficiency. There are several groups of materials that are being developed. Ultrahigh-efficiency devices (&amp;eta;&gt;30%)&lt;ref&gt;Deb, Satyen K. (May 2000) [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy00osti/28060.pdf Recent Developments in High Efficiency PV cells]. nrel.gov&lt;/ref&gt; are made by using GaAs and GaInP2 semiconductors with multijunction tandem cells. High-quality, single-crystal silicon materials are used to achieve high-efficiency, low cost cells (&amp;eta;&gt;20%).

Recent developments in Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) have made significant advancements in power conversion efficiency from 3% to over 15% since their introduction in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3390/polym6092473| title = Towards High Performance Organic Photovoltaic Cells: A Review of Recent Development in Organic Photovoltaics| journal = Polymers| volume = 6| issue = 9| pages = 2473–2509| year = 2014| last1 = Yu | first1 = J. | last2 = Zheng | first2 = Y. | last3 = Huang | first3 = J. | doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the highest reported power conversion efficiency ranges from 6.7% to 8.94% for small molecule, 8.4%–10.6% for polymer OPVs, and 7% to 21% for perovskite OPVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nmat3160| pmid = 22057387| title = Solution-processed small-molecule solar cells with 6.7% efficiency| journal = Nature Materials| volume = 11| issue = 1| pages = 44–8| year = 2011| last1 = Sun | first1 = Y. | last2 = Welch | first2 = G.

Recent improvements have increased the efficiency and lowered cost, while remaining environmentally-benign and renewable.

[[Perovskite solar cell|Perovskite cells]] are also rapidly (as of 2019) progressing, with top efficiencies increasing from 13% to 23.7% for non stabilized cells and up to 28% for perovskite/Si tandem monolithic cells between 2012 and 2018.

Several companies have begun embedding [[power optimizer]]s into PV modules called [[smart module]]s. These modules perform [[maximum power point tracking]] (MPPT) for each module individually, measure performance data for monitoring, and provide additional safety features. Such modules can also compensate for shading effects, wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;St. John, Jeff (23 August 2012) [http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-electronics-panel-integration-and-the-bankability-challenge Solar Electronics, Panel Integration and the Bankability Challenge]. greentechmedia.com&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major causes for the decreased performance of cells is overheating. The efficiency of a solar cell declines by about 0.5% for every 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature. This means that a 100 degree increase in surface temperature could decrease the efficiency of a solar cell by about half. Self-cooling solar cells are one solution to this problem. Rather than using energy to cool the surface, pyramid and cone shapes can be formed from [[silica]], and attached to the surface of a solar panel. Doing so allows visible light to reach the [[solar cell]]s, but reflects [[infrared]] rays (which carry heat).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/18/tech/innovation/solar-cells-of-the-future/ Self-cooling Solar Cells].

[[Solar power in China|China]] is followed by the [[Solar power in the United States|United States]] and [[Solar power in Japan|Japan]], while installations in [[Solar power in Germany|Germany]], once the world's largest producer, have been slowing down.

In 2017 a study in [[Science (journal)|Science]] estimated that by 2030 global PV installed capacities will be between 3,000 and 10,000 GW.&lt;ref name="Haegel 2017" /&gt; The EPIA/[[Greenpeace]] Solar Generation Paradigm Shift Scenario (formerly called Advanced Scenario) from 2010 shows that by the year 2030, 1,845&amp;nbsp;GW of PV systems could be generating approximately 2,646&amp;nbsp;TWh/year of electricity around the world. Combined with [[Efficient energy use|energy use efficiency]] improvements, this would represent the electricity needs of more than 9% of the world's population.

[[Michael Liebreich]], from [[Bloomberg L.P.#New Energy Finance|Bloomberg New Energy Finance]], anticipates a tipping point for solar energy. The costs of power from wind and solar are already below those of conventional electricity generation in some parts of the world, as they have fallen sharply and will continue to do so. He also asserts, that the electrical grid has been greatly expanded worldwide, and is ready to receive and distribute electricity from renewable sources. In addition, worldwide electricity prices came under strong pressure from renewable energy sources, that are, in part, enthusiastically embraced by consumers.&lt;ref name=bloomberg-leibreich-2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liebreich|first1=Michael|title=A YEAR OF CRACKING ICE: 10 PREDICTIONS FOR 2014|url=http://about.bnef.com/blog/liebreich-a-year-of-cracking-ice-10-predictions-for-2014/|publisher=Bloomberg New Energy Finance|accessdate=24 April 2014|date=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental impacts of photovoltaic technologies ===
'''''Types of impacts'''''

While solar photovoltaic (PV) cells are promising for clean energy production, their deployment is hindered by production costs, material availability, and toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environmentalprogress.org/big-news/2017/6/21/are-we-headed-for-a-solar-waste-crisis|title=Are we headed for a solar waste crisis?|website=Environmentalprogress.org|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data required to investigate their impact are sometimes affected by a rather large amount of uncertainty. The values of human labor and water consumption, for example, are not precisely assessed due to the lack of systematic and accurate analyses in the scientific literature.&lt;ref name=Mayumi2017/&gt;

[[Life-cycle assessment|Life cycle assessment]] (LCA) is one method of determining environmental impacts from PV. Many studies have been done on the various types of PV including [[First generation solar cell|first generation]], second generation, and [[Third Generation Solar Cell|third generation]]. Usually these PV LCA studies select a [[Life-cycle assessment#Cradle-to-gate|cradle to gate]] system boundary because often at the time the studies are conducted, it is a new technology not commercially available yet and their required balance of system components and disposal methods are unknown.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Collier, J., Wu, S. &amp; Apul, D.|title= Life cycle environmental impacts from CZTS (copper zinc tin sulfide) and Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (zinc phosphide) thin film PV (photovoltaic) cells|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2014.06.076|journal= Energy |volume=74|pages= 314–321 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional LCA can look at many different impact categories ranging from [[global warming potential]], [[ecotoxicity]], human toxicity, water depletion, and many others.

Most LCAs of PV have focused on two categories: carbon dioxide equivalents per kWh and energy pay-back time (EPBT). The  EPBT is defined as " the time needed to compensate for the total renewable- and non-renewable- primary energy required during the life cycle of a PV system".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anctil, A., Babbitt, C.

One difficulty in determining impacts due to PV is to determine if the wastes are released to the air, water, or soil during the manufacturing phase.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Research is underway to try to understand emissions and releases during the lifetime of PV systems.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fthenakis, V.

'''''Impacts from first-generation PV'''''

[[Crystalline silicon]] modules are the most extensively studied PV type in terms of LCA since they are the most commonly used. [[Mono-crystalline silicon cell|Mono-crystalline silicon]] photovoltaic systems (mono-si) have an average efficiency of 14.0%.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Solar Photovoltaics, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, 2012, 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The cells tend to follow a structure of front electrode, anti-reflection film, n-layer, p-layer, and back electrode, with the sun hitting the front electrode. EPBT ranges from 1.7 to 2.7 years.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Krebs, F. C. |title=Fabrication and processing of polymer solar cells: a review of printing and coating techniques|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2008.10.004|journal= Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells |volume=93|issue=4|pages= 394–412 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cradle to gate of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq/kWh ranges from 37.3 to 72.2 grams.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yue, D., You, F. &amp; Darling, S.

Techniques to produce [[multi-crystalline silicon]] (multi-si) photovoltaic cells are simpler and cheaper than mono-si, however tend to make less efficient cells, an average of 13.2%.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; EPBT ranges from 1.5 to 2.6 years.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The cradle to gate of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq/kWh ranges from 28.5 to 69 grams.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Some studies have looked beyond EPBT and GWP to other environmental impacts. In one such study, conventional energy mix in Greece was compared to multi-si PV and found a 95% overall reduction in impacts including carcinogens, eco-toxicity, acidification, eutrophication, and eleven others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gaidajis, G.  |author2=Angelakoglou, K. |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1080/10286608.2012.710608 |title=Environmental performance of renewable energy systems with the application of life-cycle assessment: a multi-Si photovoltaic module case study|journal=Civil Engineering and Environmental Systems |volume=29|issue=4 |pages= 231–238 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Impacts from second generation'''''

[[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|Cadmium telluride]] (CdTe) is one of the fastest-growing [[Thin-film solar cell|thin film based solar cells]] which are collectively known as second generation devices. This new thin film device also shares similar performance restrictions ([[Shockley–Queisser limit|Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit]]) as conventional Si devices but promises to lower the cost of each device by both reducing material and energy consumption during manufacturing. Today the global market share of CdTe is 5.4%, up from 4.7% in 2008.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This technology's highest power conversion efficiency is 21%.&lt;ref&gt;Photovoltaics Report. (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, ISE, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The cell structure includes glass substrate (around 2&amp;nbsp;mm), transparent conductor layer, CdS buffer layer (50–150&amp;nbsp;nm), CdTe absorber and a metal contact layer.

CdTe PV systems require less energy input in their production than other commercial PV systems per unit electricity production. The average CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq/kWh is around 18 grams (cradle to gate). CdTe has the fastest EPBT of all commercial PV technologies, which varies between 0.3 and 1.2 years.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Goe, M.  |author2=Gaustad, G.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Strengthening the case for recycling photovoltaics: An energy payback analysis|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.01.036|journal= Applied Energy |volume=120|pages= 41–48 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Copper indium gallium selenide|Copper Indium Gallium Diselenide]] (CIGS) is a thin film solar cell based on the copper indium diselenide (CIS) family of chalcopyrite [[semiconductor]]s. CIS and CIGS are often used interchangeably within the CIS/CIGS community. The cell structure includes soda lime glass as the substrate, Mo layer as the back contact, CIS/CIGS as the absorber layer, cadmium sulfide (CdS) or Zn (S,OH)x  as the buffer layer, and ZnO:Al as the front contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eisenberg, D.

Materials necessary for assembly are readily available, and are less costly per watt of solar cell. CIGS based solar devices resist performance degradation over time and are highly stable in the field.

Reported global warming potential impacts of CIGS range from 20.5 – 58.8 grams CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq/kWh of electricity generated for different [[solar irradiation]] (1,700 to 2,200 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/y) and power conversion efficiency (7.8 – 9.12%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1530-9290.2011.00423.x|author=Kim, H.

'''''Impacts from third generation'''''

Third-generation PVs are designed to combine the advantages of both the first and second generation devices and they do not have [[Shockley-Queisser limit]], a theoretical limit for first and second generation PV cells. The thickness of a third generation device is less than 1&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Brown, G. F.  |author2=Wu, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Third generation photovoltaics|doi=10.1002/lpor.200810039|journal= Laser &amp; Photonics Reviews |volume=3|issue=4|pages= 394–405 |year=2009|bibcode=2009LPRv....3..394B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One emerging alternative and promising technology is based on an organic-inorganic hybrid solar cell made of methylammonium lead halide perovskites. [[Perovskite solar cell|Perovskite PV cells]] have progressed rapidly over the past few years and have become one of the most attractive areas for PV research.&lt;ref name="Celik et al 2016"/&gt; The cell structure includes a metal back contact (which can be made of Al, Au or Ag), a hole transfer layer (spiro-MeOTAD, P3HT, PTAA, CuSCN, CuI, or NiO), and absorber layer (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PbIxBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-x, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PbIxCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-x or CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), an electron transport layer (TiO, ZnO, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and a top contact layer (fluorine doped tin oxide or tin doped indium oxide).

There are a limited number of published studies to address the environmental impacts of perovskite solar cells.&lt;ref name="Celik et al 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Espinosa, N., Serrano-Luján, L., Urbina, A. &amp; Krebs, F.

Due to the instability of perovskite cells lead may eventually be exposed to fresh water during the use phase. These LCA  studies looked at human and ecotoxicity of perovskite solar cells and found they were  surprisingly low and may not be an environmental issue.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  Global warming potential of perovskite PVs were found to be in the range of 24–1500 grams CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq/kWh electricity production. Similarly, reported EPBT of the published paper range from 0.2 to 15 years. The large range of reported values highlight the uncertainties associated with these studies. Celik et al. (2016) critically discussed the assumptions made in perovskite PV LCA studies.&lt;ref name="Celik et al 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2016.04.037 |title=Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of perovskite PV cells projected from lab to fab |journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells |volume=156 |pages=157–69 |year=2016 |last1=Celik |first1=Ilke |last2=Song |first2=Zhaoning |last3=Cimaroli |first3=Alexander J. |last4=Yan |first4=Yanfa |last5=Heben |first5=Michael J. |last6=Apul |first6=Defne |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two new promising thin film technologies are [[copper zinc tin sulfide]] (Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnSnS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or CZTS),&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[zinc phosphide]] (Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and single-walled carbon nano-tubes (SWCNT).&lt;ref name="Celik, I. 2017"&gt;Celik, I., Mason, B.

[[Organic solar cell|Organic]] and [[Polymer solar cell|polymer photovoltaic]] (OPV) are a relatively new area of research. The tradition OPV cell structure layers consist of a semi-transparent electrode, electron blocking layer, tunnel junction, holes blocking layer, electrode, with the sun hitting the transparent electrode. OPV replaces silver with carbon as an electrode material lowering manufacturing cost and making them more environmentally friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/aenm.201400732|title=Carbon: The Ultimate Electrode Choice for Widely Distributed Polymer Solar Cells|journal=Advanced Energy Materials|volume=4|issue=15|pages=n/a|year=2014|last1=Dos Reis Benatto|first1=Gisele A.|last2=Roth|first2=Bérenger|last3=Madsen|first3=Morten V.|last4=Hösel|first4=Markus|last5=Søndergaard|first5=Roar R.|last6=Jørgensen|first6=Mikkel|last7=Krebs|first7=Frederik C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; OPV are flexible, low weight, and work well with roll-to roll manufacturing for mass production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3390/electronics3010132 |title=Electron and Hole Transport Layers: Their Use in Inverted Bulk Heterojunction Polymer Solar Cells |journal=Electronics |volume=3 |pages=132–164 |year=2014 |last1=Lattante |first1=Sandro |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; OPV uses "only abundant elements coupled to an extremely low embodied energy through very low processing temperatures using only ambient processing conditions on simple printing equipment enabling energy pay-back times".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2013.05.032|title=Polymer and organic solar cells viewed as thin film technologies: What it will take for them to become a success outside academia|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|volume=119|pages=73–76|year=2013|last1=Krebs|first1=Frederik C.|last2=Jørgensen|first2=Mikkel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current efficiencies range from 1–6.5%,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2010.08.020|title=A life cycle analysis of polymer solar cell modules prepared using roll-to-roll methods under ambient conditions|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|volume=95|issue=5|pages=1293–1302|year=2011|last1=Espinosa|first1=Nieves|last2=García-Valverde|first2=Rafael|last3=Urbina|first3=Antonio|last4=Krebs|first4=Frederik C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; however theoretical analyses show promise beyond 10% efficiency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There have been major changes in the underlying costs, industry structure and market prices of solar photovoltaics technology, over the years, and gaining a coherent picture of the shifts occurring across the industry value chain globally is a challenge. This is due to: "the rapidity of cost and price changes, the complexity of the PV supply chain, which involves a large number of manufacturing processes, the balance of system (BOS) and installation costs associated with complete PV systems, the choice of different distribution channels, and differences between regional markets within which PV is being deployed". Further complexities result from the many different policy support initiatives that have been put in place to facilitate photovoltaics commercialisation in various countries.&lt;ref name=reconsidering /&gt;

The PV industry has seen dramatic drops in module prices since 2008. In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the $1.00/W mark. The $1.00/W installed cost, is often regarded in the PV industry as marking the achievement of [[grid parity]] for PV. Technological advancements, manufacturing process improvements, and industry re-structuring, mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years.&lt;ref name=reconsidering&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.renene.2012.11.029 | url = http://az2112.com/assets/energy-bnef_re_considering_the_economics_of_photovoltaic_power_a_co_authored_white.pdf | title = Re-considering the economics of photovoltaic power | journal = Renewable Energy | volume = 53 | pages = 329–338 | year = 2013 | last1 = Bazilian | first1 = M. | last2 = Onyeji | first2 = I. | last3 = Liebreich | first3 = M. | last4 = MacGill | first4 = I. | last5 = Chase | first5 = J. | last6 = Shah | first6 = J. | last7 = Gielen | first7 = D. | last8 = Arent | first8 = D. | last9 = Landfear | first9 = D. | last10 = Zhengrong | first10 = S. | citeseerx = 10.1.1.692.1880 | access-date = 4 September 2015 | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6SFVDz2Cf?url=http://az2112.com/assets/energy-bnef_re_considering_the_economics_of_photovoltaic_power_a_co_authored_white.pdf | archive-date = 31 August 2014 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017 power-purchase agreement prices for solar farms below $0.05/kWh are common in the United States and the lowest bids in several international countries were about $0.03/kWh.&lt;ref name="Haegel 2017"&gt;{{cite journal  | author = Nancy M.

[[Financial incentives for photovoltaics]], such as [[feed-in tariff]]s, have often been offered to electricity consumers to install and operate solar-electric generating systems. Government has sometimes also offered incentives in order to encourage the PV industry to achieve the [[economies of scale]] needed to compete where the cost of PV-generated electricity is above the cost from the existing grid. Such policies are implemented to promote national or territorial [[energy security|energy independence]], [[high tech]] job creation and reduction of [[carbon emissions|carbon dioxide emissions]] which cause climate change. Due to economies of scale solar panels get less costly as people use and buy more—as manufacturers increase production to meet demand, the cost and price is expected to drop in the years to come.

Retrieved on 31 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) may reduce cost by concentrating up to 1,000 suns (through magnifying lens) onto a smaller sized photovoltaic cell. However, such concentrated solar power requires sophisticated heat sink designs, otherwise the photovoltaic cell overheats, which reduces its efficiency and life. To further exacerbate the concentrated cooling design, the heat sink must be passive, otherwise the power required for active cooling would reduce the overall efficiency and economy.

Crystalline silicon solar cell prices have fallen from $76.67/Watt in 1977 to an estimated $0.74/Watt in 2013.&lt;ref name="Econ1"&gt;{{cite news| date =21 November 2012|url=https://www.economist.com/news/21566414-alternative-energy-will-no-longer-be-alternative-sunny-uplands| title =Sunny Uplands: Alternative energy will no longer be alternative| publisher=The Economist| accessdate = 28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen as evidence supporting [[Swanson's law]], an observation similar to the famous [[Moore's Law]] that states that solar cell prices fall 20% for every doubling of industry capacity.&lt;ref name="Econ1" /&gt;

In many locations, PV has reached grid parity, which is usually defined as PV production costs at or below retail electricity prices (though often still above the power station prices for coal or gas-fired generation without their distribution and other costs). However, in many countries there is still a need for more access to capital to develop PV projects. To solve this problem [[securitization]] has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2013.12.045| title = Securitization of residential solar photovoltaic assets: Costs, risks and uncertainty| journal = Energy Policy| volume = 67| pages = 488–498| year = 2014| last1 = Alafita | first1 = T.| last2 = Pearce | first2 = J.

Photovoltaic power is also generated during a time of day that is close to peak demand (precedes it) in electricity systems with high use of air conditioning. Since large-scale PV operation requires back-up in the form of spinning reserves, its marginal cost of generation in the middle of the day is typically lowest, but not zero, when PV is generating electricity. This can be seen in Figure 1 of this paper:.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2017.07.060 |title=Jointly reforming the prices of industrial fuels and residential electricity in Saudi Arabia |journal=Energy Policy |volume=109 |pages=747–756 |year=2017 |last1=Matar |first1=Walid |last2=Anwer |first2=Murad|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, it is now evident that, given a carbon price of $50/ton, which would raise the price of coal-fired power by 5c/kWh, solar PV will be cost-competitive in most locations. The declining price of PV has been reflected in rapidly growing installations, totaling about 23&amp;nbsp;GW in 2011. Although some consolidation is likely in 2012, due to support cuts in the large markets of Germany and Italy, strong growth seems likely to continue for the rest of the decade. Already, by one estimate, total investment in renewables for 2011 exceeded investment in carbon-based electricity generation.&lt;ref name=natint&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/the-end-the-nuclear-renaissance-6325?page=1 |title=The End of the Nuclear Renaissance|author=Quiggin, John|date=3 January 2012|website=National Interest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of self consumption payback time is calculated based on how much electricity is not brought from the grid. Additionally, using PV solar power to charge DC batteries, as used in Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles and Electric Vehicles, leads to greater efficiencies. Traditionally, DC generated electricity from solar PV must be converted to AC for buildings, at an average 10% loss during the conversion. An additional efficiency loss occurs in the transition back to DC for battery driven devices and vehicles, and using various interest rates and energy price changes were calculated to find present values that range from $2,057 to $8,213 (analysis from 2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verdel3c.com/blog/converting-solar-energy-phev-battery/ Converting Solar Energy into the PHEV Battery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222163522/http://www.verdel3c.com/blog/converting-solar-energy-phev-battery/ |date=22 February 2014 }}.

== Manufacturing ==
{{see also|List of photovoltaics companies}}
Overall the
manufacturing process of creating solar photovoltaics is simple in that it does
not require the culmination of many complex or moving parts. Because of the
solid state nature of PV systems they often have relatively long lifetimes,
anywhere from 10 to 30 years. To increase electrical output of a PV
system, the manufacturer must simply add more photovoltaic components and
because of this economies of scale are important for manufacturers as costs
decrease with increasing output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = U.S. Solar Photovoltaic Manufacturing: Industry Trends, Global Competition, Federal Support|last = Platzer|first = Michael|date = January 27, 2015|journal = Congressional Research Service|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are many types of PV systems known to be effective, crystalline silicon PV accounted for around 90% of the worldwide production of PV in 2013. Manufacturing silicon PV systems has several steps. First, polysilicon is processed from mined quartz until it is very pure (semi-conductor grade). This is melted down when small amounts of [[boron]], a group III element, are added to make a p-type semiconductor rich in electron holes. Typically using a seed crystal, an ingot of this solution is grown from the liquid polycrystalline. The ingot may also be cast in a mold. Wafers of this semiconductor material are cut from the bulk material with wire saws, and then go through surface etching before being cleaned. Next, the wafers are placed into a phosphorus vapor deposition furnace which lays a very thin layer of phosphorus, a group V element, which creates an n-type semiconducting surface. To reduce energy losses, an anti-reflective coating is added to the surface, along with electrical contacts. After finishing the cell, cells are connected via electrical circuit according to the specific application and prepared for shipping and installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = How PV Cells Are Made|url = http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/consumer/solar_electricity/basics/how_cells_made.htm|website = www.fsec.ucf.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystalline silicon photovoltaics are only one type of PV, and while they represent the majority of solar cells produced currently there are many new and promising technologies that have the potential to be scaled up to meet future energy needs. As of 2018, crystalline silicon cell technology serves as the basis for several PV module types, including monocrystalline, multicrystalline, mono PERC, and bifacial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Solar PV Modules |url = https://www.targray.com/solar/pv-modules|website = www.targray.com|accessdate = 2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another newer technology, thin-film PV, are manufactured by depositing semiconducting layers on substrate in vacuum. The substrate is often glass or stainless-steel, and these semiconducting layers are made of many types of materials including cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium diselenide (CIS), copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), and amorphous silicon (a-Si). After being deposited onto the substrate the semiconducting layers are separated and connected by electrical circuit by laser-scribing. Thin-film photovoltaics now make up around 20% of the overall production of PV because of the reduced materials requirements and cost to manufacture modules consisting of thin-films as compared to silicon-based wafers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Thin Film Photovoltaics|url = http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/consumer/solar_electricity/basics/thin-film.htm|website = www.fsec.ucf.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because organic photovoltaics require very high purity and are relatively reactive they must be encapsulated which vastly increases cost of manufacturing and meaning that they are not feasible for large scale up. Dye-sensitized PVs are similar in efficiency to OPVs but are significantly easier to manufacture. However these dye-sensitized photovoltaics present storage problems because the liquid electrolyte is toxic and can potentially permeate the plastics used in the cell. Quantum dot solar cells are quantum dot sensitized DSSCs and are solution processed meaning they are potentially scalable, but currently they peak at 12% efficiency. Perovskite solar cells are a very efficient solar energy converter and have excellent optoelectric properties for photovoltaic purposes, but they are expensive and difficult to manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;Secor, Ethan.

=== Photovoltaic systems ===
{{Main|Photovoltaic system}}

A photovoltaic system, or solar PV system is a power system designed to supply usable solar power by means of photovoltaics. It consists of an arrangement of several components, including solar panels to absorb and directly convert sunlight into electricity, a solar inverter to change the electric current from DC to AC, as well as mounting, cabling and other electrical accessories. PV systems range from small, [[rooftop photovoltaic power station|roof-top mounted]] or [[building-integrated photovoltaics|building-integrated]] systems with capacities from a few to several tens of [[kilowatts]], to large utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station|power stations]] of hundreds of [[megawatts]]. Nowadays, most PV systems are [[grid-connected photovoltaic power system|grid-connected]], while [[Stand-alone power system|stand-alone]] systems only account for a small portion of the market.

*;Rooftop and building integrated systems
[[File:SolarFachwerkhaus.jpg|thumb|Rooftop PV on half-timbered house]]

: Photovoltaic arrays are often associated with buildings: either integrated into them, mounted on them or mounted nearby on the ground. [[Rooftop PV system]]s are most often retrofitted into existing buildings, usually mounted on top of the existing roof structure or on the existing walls. Alternatively, an array can be located separately from the building but connected by cable to supply power for the building. [[Building-integrated photovoltaics]] (BIPV) are increasingly incorporated into the roof or walls of new domestic and industrial buildings as a principal or ancillary source of electrical power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buildingsolar.com/technology.asp Building Integrated Photovoltaics], Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, accessed: 23 March 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202193559/http://www.buildingsolar.com/technology.asp |date=2 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roof tiles with integrated PV cells are sometimes used as well. Provided there is an open gap in which air can circulate, rooftop mounted solar panels can provide a passive cooling effect on buildings during the day and also keep accumulated heat in at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar panels keep buildings cool |url=http://www.jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news/news_releases/release.sfe?id=1094 |publisher=University of California, San Diego |accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, residential rooftop systems have small capacities of around 5–10&amp;nbsp;kW, while commercial rooftop systems often amount to several hundreds of kilowatts. Although rooftop systems are much smaller than ground-mounted utility-scale power plants, they account for most of the worldwide installed capacity.&lt;ref name=epia-2014&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Market Outlook for Photovoltaics 2014–2018 |url=http://www.epia.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/EPIA_Global_Market_Outlook_for_Photovoltaics_2014-2018_-_Medium_Res.pdf |publisher=EPIA – European Photovoltaic Industry Association |page=45 |accessdate=19 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625154728/http://www.epia.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/EPIA_Global_Market_Outlook_for_Photovoltaics_2014-2018_-_Medium_Res.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*;Concentrator photovoltaics

: [[Concentrator photovoltaics]] (CPV) is a photovoltaic technology that contrary to conventional flat-plate PV systems uses lenses and curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, [[multi-junction]] (MJ) solar cells. In addition, CPV systems often use [[solar tracker]]s and sometimes a cooling system to further increase their efficiency. Ongoing research and development is rapidly improving their competitiveness in the utility-scale segment and in areas of high solar [[insolation]].

*;Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector

: [[Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector]] (PVT) are systems that convert solar radiation into [[Internal energy|thermal]] and electrical energy. These systems combine a solar PV cell, which converts sunlight into electricity, with a [[solar thermal collector]], which captures the remaining energy and removes waste heat from the PV module. The capture of both electricity and heat allow these devices to have higher [[exergy]] and thus be more overall energy efficient than solar PV or solar thermal alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2013.08.026| title = Spectral beam splitting for efficient conversion of solar energy—A review| journal = Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews| volume = 28| pages = 654–663| year = 2013| last1 = Mojiri | first1 = A. | last2 = Taylor | first2 = R. | last3 = Thomsen | first3 = E. | last4 = Rosengarten | first4 = G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.01.041| title = Optimizing limited solar roof access by exergy analysis of solar thermal, photovoltaic, and hybrid photovoltaic thermal systems| journal = Applied Energy| volume = 120| pages = 115–124| year = 2014| last1 = Pathak | first1 = M.

*;Power stations
[[File:Topaz Solar Farm, California Valley.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of the [[Topaz Solar Farm]]]]

: Many utility-scale [[solar farm]]s have been constructed all over the world. As of 2015, the 579-megawatt (MW&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;) [[Solar Star]] is the world's largest [[photovoltaic power station]], followed by the [[Desert Sunlight Solar Farm]] and the [[Topaz Solar Farm]], both with a capacity of 550 MW&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;, constructed by US-company [[First Solar]], using [[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|CdTe modules]], a [[thin film solar cell|thin-film]] PV technology.&lt;ref name=rew11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/09/doe-closes-on-three-major-solar-projects |title=DOE Closes on Four Major Solar Projects |date= 30 September 2011 |website= Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt; All three power stations are located in the Californian desert. Many solar farms around the world are integrated with agriculture and some use innovative solar tracking systems that follow the sun's daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than conventional fixed-mounted systems. There are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations.

*;Rural electrification

: [[Developing countries]] where many villages are often more than five kilometres away from grid power are increasingly using photovoltaics. In remote locations in India a rural lighting program has been providing solar powered [[LED]] lighting to replace kerosene lamps. The solar powered lamps were sold at about the cost of a few months' supply of kerosene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6600213.stm Solar loans light up rural India].

These are areas where the social costs and benefits offer an excellent case for going solar, though the lack of profitability has relegated such endeavors to humanitarian efforts. However, in 1995 solar [[rural electrification]] projects had been found to be difficult to sustain due to unfavorable economics, lack of technical support, and a legacy of ulterior motives of north-to-south technology transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Jon David Erickson|Erickson]]|first=Jon D.|author2=Chapman, Duane|title=Photovoltaic Technology: Markets, Economics, and Development|journal=World Development|year=1995|volume=23|issue=7|pages=1129–1141|doi=10.1016/0305-750x(95)00033-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*;Standalone systems

: Until a decade or so ago, PV was used frequently to power calculators and novelty devices. Improvements in integrated circuits and low power [[liquid crystal display]]s make it possible to power such devices for several years between battery changes, making PV use less common. In contrast, solar powered remote fixed devices have seen increasing use recently in locations where significant connection cost makes grid power prohibitively expensive.

*;Floating solar

: Where land may be limited, PV can be deployed as [[floating solar]]. In May 2008, the Far Niente Winery in Oakville, CA pioneered the world's first "floatovoltaic" system by installing 994 photovoltaic solar panels onto 130 pontoons and floating them on the winery's irrigation pond. The floating system generates about 477&amp;nbsp;kW of peak output and when combined with an array of cells located adjacent to the pond is able to fully offset the winery's electricity consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Winery-goes-solar-with-Floatovoltaics-3282171.php Winery goes solar with 'Floatovoltaics']. SFGate (29 May 2008). Retrieved on 31 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary benefit of a floating system is that it avoids the need to sacrifice valuable land area that could be used for another purpose. In the case of the Far Niente Winery, the floating system saved three-quarters of an acre that would have been required for a land-based system. That land area can instead be used for agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farniente.com/assets/files/pdfs/Floatovoltaic.pdf NAPA VALLEY’S FAR NIENTE WINERY INTRODUCES FIRST-EVER "FLOATOVOLTAIC" SOLAR ARRAY] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316135710/http://farniente.com/assets/files/pdfs/Floatovoltaic.pdf |date=16 March 2015 }}. farniente.com&lt;/ref&gt; Another benefit of a floating solar system is that the panels are kept at a lower temperature than they would be on land, leading to a higher efficiency of solar energy conversion. The floating panels also reduce the amount of water lost through evaporation and inhibit the growth of algae.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampentland/2011/08/15/napa-winery-pioneers-solar-floatovoltaics/ Napa Winery Pioneers Solar Floatovoltaics].

*;Telecommunication and signaling

: Solar PV power is ideally suited for telecommunication applications such as local telephone exchange, radio and TV broadcasting, microwave and other forms of electronic communication links. This is because, in most telecommunication application, storage batteries are already in use and the electrical system is basically DC. In hilly and mountainous terrain, radio and TV signals may not reach as they get blocked or reflected back due to undulating terrain. At these locations, [[Low-power broadcasting|low power transmitters (LPT)]] are installed to receive and retransmit the signal for local population.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, B. H.

: [[Solar panels on spacecraft]] are usually the sole source of power to run the sensors, active heating and cooling, and communications.  A battery stores this energy for use when the solar panels are in shadow.  In some, the power is also used for [[spacecraft propulsion]]—[[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]].&lt;ref name="NASA11"&gt;NASA JPL Publication: [http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf11-4.html#propulsion Basics of Space Flight] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208093125/http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf11-4.html |date=8 December 2006 }}, Chapter 11.

That value corresponds to a premium of approximately $17,000 for a relatively new 3,100 watt PV system (the average size of PV systems in the study).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eetd.lbl.gov/ea/ems/reports/lbnl-4476e.pdf |title=An Analysis of the Effects of Residential Photovoltaic Energy Systems on Home Sales Prices in California |website=Berkeley National Laboratory |author1=Hoen, Ben |author2=Wiser, Ryan |author3=Cappers, Peter |author4=Thayer, Mark |lastauthoramp=yes |date=April 2011 |access-date=20 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506062156/http://eetd.lbl.gov/ea/ems/reports/lbnl-4476e.pdf |archive-date=6 May 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Limitations==

*;Pollution and Energy in Production 
PV has been a well-known method of generating clean, emission-free electricity. PV systems are often made of PV modules and inverter (changing DC to AC). PV modules are mainly made of PV cells, which has no fundamental difference from the material used for making computer chips. The process of producing PV cells is energy-intensive and involves highly poisonous and environmentally toxic chemicals. There are a few PV manufacturing plants around the world producing PV modules with energy produced from PV. This counteractive measure considerably reduces the carbon footprint of the manufacturing process of PV cells. Management of the chemicals used and produced during the manufacturing process is subject to the factories' local laws and regulations.

*; Impact on Electricity Network

For behind-the-meter rooftop photovoltaic systems, the energy flow becomes two-way. When there is more local generation than consumption, electricity is exported to the grid, allowing for [[net metering]]. However, electricity networks traditionally are not designed to deal with two-way energy transfer, which may introduce technical issues. An over-voltage issue may come out as the electricity flows from these PV households back to the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3390/su10041224 |title=Power Quality and Rooftop-Photovoltaic Households: An Examination of Measured Data at Point of Customer Connection |journal=Sustainability |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=1224 |year=2018 |last1=Miller |first1=Wendy |last2=Liu |first2=Aaron |last3=Amin |first3=Zakaria |last4=Wagner |first4=Andreas |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are solutions to manage the over-voltage issue, such as regulating PV inverter power factor, new voltage and energy control equipment at electricity distributor level, re-conductor the electricity wires, demand side management, etc. There are often limitations and costs related to these solutions.

High generation during the middle of the day reduces the net generation demand, but higher peak net demand as the sun goes down can require rapid ramping of utility generating stations, producing a load profile called the [[duck curve]].

*; Implications for Electricity Bill Management and Energy Investment

There is no silver bullet in electricity or energy demand and bill management, because customers (sites) have different specific situations, e.g. different comfort/convenience needs, different electricity tariffs, or different usage patterns. Electricity tariff may have a few elements, such as daily access and metering charge, energy charge (based on kWh, MWh) or peak demand charge (e.g. a price for the highest 30min energy consumption in a month). PV is a promising option for reducing energy charges when electricity prices are reasonably high and continuously increasing, such as in Australia and Germany. However, for sites with peak demand charge in place, PV may be less attractive if peak demands mostly occur in the late afternoon to early evening, for example in residential communities. Overall, energy investment is largely an economic decision and it is better to make investment decisions based on systematic evaluation of options in operational improvement, energy efficiency, onsite generation and energy storage.&lt;ref&gt;L.
