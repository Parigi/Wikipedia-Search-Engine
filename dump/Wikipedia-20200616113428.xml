'''Joseph Mantello''' (born December 27, 1962) is an American actor and director best known for his work on Broadway productions of ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'', ''[[Take Me Out (play)|Take Me Out]]'' and ''[[Assassins (musical)|Assassins]]'', as well as earlier in his career being one of the original Broadway cast members of ''[[Angels in America]]''.

==Early life and education==
Mantello was born in [[Rockford, Illinois]], the son of Judy and Richard Mantello, an accountant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/99/Joe-Mantello.html|title=Joe Mantello Biography (1962-)|website=www.filmreference.com|accessdate=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/us/iowa/cedar-rapids/cedar-rapids-gazette/2003/06-24/page-30|title=Cedar Rapids Gazette Archives, Jun 24, 2003, p. 30|date=June 24, 2003|publisher=|accessdate=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father is of Italian ancestry and his mother is of half Italian descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Joe-Mantello-talks-The-Last-Ship-The-Normal-Heart/48021.html|title=Joe Mantello talks 'The Last Ship,' 'The Normal Heart' - Gay Lesbian Bi Trans News Archive - Windy City Times|first=Windy City|last=Times|website=Windy City Times|accessdate=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-19/entertainment/ca-44587_1_joe-mantello/2|title=Mr. Mantello's Wild Ride :  He had the 'role of a lifetime' in 'Angels in America.' So why is Joe Mantello putting his acting aside? Here's a clue: His other theatrical love is directing.|first=Patrick|last=Pacheco|date=March 19, 1995|publisher=|accessdate=July 5, 2018|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mantello studied at the [[North Carolina School of the Arts]]; he started the Edge Theater in [[New York City]] with actress [[Mary-Louise Parker]] and writer [[Peter Hedges]]. He is a member of the [[Naked Angels (theater company)|Naked Angels]] theater company and an associate artist at the [[Roundabout Theatre Company]].

==Career==
Mantello came to New York from Illinois in 1984 in the midst of the [[AIDS]] crisis, having overcome a youthful feeling, he admitted to a reporter in 2013,  that "for some reason I was deeply ashamed of the theater early on. I think it had to do with this growing sense I was gay, although I couldn’t have put a word to it back then. Where I grew up, boys played sports. When [teacher] Mrs. Windsor wrote in my yearbook, 'Have you ever considered a career in the theater?' it was literally like she wrote the word '[[faggot (slang)|faggot]]'."&lt;ref name=Bernstein&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Jacob|title=Turning point: Broadway Joe|url=http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/turning-point-joe-mantello-on-broadway/?ref=joemantello|accessdate=June 10, 2013|newspaper=T: The New York Times Style Magazine|date=June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mantello began his theatrical career as an actor in Keith Curran's ''Walking the Dead'' and [[Paula Vogel]]'s ''[[The Baltimore Waltz]]''.  On the transition from acting to directing, Mantello said, "I think I've become a better actor since I started directing, although some people might disagree. Since I've been removed from the process I see things that actors fall into. Now there's a part of me that's removed from the process and can stand back."&lt;ref&gt;Burdette, Nicole. [http://bombsite.com/issues/40/articles/1570 "Joe Mantello"], ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'', Summer 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Mantello directs a variety of theatre works, as ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted: "Very few American directors – [[Jack O'Brien (director)|Jack O'Brien]] and [[Mike Nichols]] come to mind – successfully jump genres and styles the way Mr. Mantello does, moving from a two-hander like ''Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune'' to the huge canvas of a mainstream musical comedy like ''Wicked,'' from downtown stand-up (''[[The Santaland Diaries]]'') to contemporary opera (''[[Dead Man Walking (opera)|Dead Man Walking]]'') to political performance art (''The Vagina Monologues'')."&lt;ref&gt;Green, Jesse.[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/11/theater/theater-surviving-assassins.html "Surviving 'Assassins'"].''The New York Times'', April 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Roundabout Theatre Company]] revival of ''[[Lips Together, Teeth Apart]]'' directed by Mantello was scheduled to open at the [[American Airlines Theatre]] in April 2010, when one of the stars, [[Megan Mullally]], suddenly quit. The production was postponed indefinitely due to her departure.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/138193-Broadway-Wont-See-Lips-Together-Teeth-Apart-This-Season "Broadway Won't See Lips Together, Teeth Apart This Season"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328214705/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/138193-Broadway-Wont-See-Lips-Together-Teeth-Apart-This-Season |date=March 28, 2010 }} playbill.com, March 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Mantello directed the [[Jon Robin Baitz]] play ''[[Other Desert Cities]]'' at the [[Booth Theater]] in 2011. He returned to acting for the first time in over a decade with the role of Ned Weeks in the Broadway limited engagement revival of ''[[The Normal Heart]]'' in April 2011,&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/150218-Larry-Kramers-The-Normal-Heart-Starring-Joe-Mantello-Opens-on-Broadway-April-27 "Larry Kramer's 'The Normal Heart', Starring Joe Mantello, Opens on Broadway April 27"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504035317/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/150218-Larry-Kramers-The-Normal-Heart-Starring-Joe-Mantello-Opens-on-Broadway-April-27 |date=May 4, 2011 }} playbill.com, April 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; for which he was nominated for the [[Tony Award]] as Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Play.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth and Gans, Andrew.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/150483-2011-Tony-Nominations-Announced-Book-of-Mormon-Earns-14-Nominations "2011 Tony Nominations Announced; 'Book of Mormon' Earns 14 Nominations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507235105/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/150483-2011-Tony-Nominations-Announced-Book-of-Mormon-Earns-14-Nominations |date=May 7, 2011 }} playbill.com, May 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Mantello had previously been nominated for the Tony Award for his role as Louis in ''[[Angels in America]]''.
