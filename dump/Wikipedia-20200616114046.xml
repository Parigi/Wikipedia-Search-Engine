'''Yucatec Maya''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|uː|k|ə|ˌ|t|ɛ|k|_|ˈ|m|aɪ|ə}}; Yucatec Maya: {{lang|yua|mayab tʼàan}} {{IPA|[majaɓˈtʼàːn]}}, {{lang|yua|mayaʼ tʼàan}} {{IPA|[majaʔˈtʼàːn]}}, {{lang|yua|maayaʼ tʼàan}} {{IPA|[màːjaʔ tʼàːn]}}, literally "flat speech"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bricker|first=Victoria|year=1998|title=Dictionary Of The Maya Language: As Spoken in Hocabá Yucatan|publisher=University of Utah Press|page=181|isbn=978-0874805697}}&lt;/ref&gt;), is a [[Mayan languages|Mayan language]] spoken in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] and northern [[Belize]]. Native speakers do not qualify it as ''Yucatec'', calling it literally "flat/Maya speech" in their language and simply ''(el) maya'' when speaking Spanish.

[[Linguist]]s have added ''Yucatec'' to the name in order to clearly distinguish it from the rest of Mayan languages (such as [[Kʼicheʼ language|Kʼicheʼ]] and [[Itzaʼ language|Itzaʼ]]). Thus the use of the term Yucatec Maya to refer to the language is scholarly or scientific nomenclature.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{cite web |title=Maya or Mayans? Comment on Correct Terminology and Spellings |url=http://www.osea-cite.org/program/maya_or_mayans.php |access-date=12 March 2017 |website=OSEA-cite.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[States of Mexico|Mexican states]] of [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], some parts of [[Campeche]], [[Tabasco]], [[Chiapas]], and [[Quintana Roo]], Yucatec Maya is still the mother tongue of a large segment of the population in the early 21st century. It has approximately 800,000 speakers in this region. There are perhaps about 6,000 speakers of Yucatec Maya in Belize.

== History ==
[[File:Conflicto Limitrofe Yucatan Campeche Quintana Roo.PNG|thumb|Yucatán Peninsula]]{{Cleanup|reason=wikification, correction|date=September 2016}}
Yucatec Maya forms part of the Yucatecan branch of the [[Mayan languages|Mayan language]] family. The Yucatecan branch is divided by linguists into the subgroups Mopan-itza and Yucatec-Lacandon. These are made up by four languages: 
*[[Itzaʼ language|Itza]], 
*[[Mopan language|Mopan]], 
*Yucatec Maya, and 
*[[Lacandon language|Lacandon]].

All the languages in the Mayan language family are thought to originate from an ancestral language that was spoken some 5,000 years ago, known as [[Proto-Mayan language|Proto-Mayan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aboutworldlanguages.com/mayan-language-family|title=Mayan Language Family {{!}} About World Languages|website=aboutworldlanguages.com|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] traded with Maya merchants off the coast of [[Yucatán]] during his expedition for the Spanish Crown in 1502, but he never made landfall. During the decade following Columbus's first contact with the Maya, the first Spaniards to set foot on Yucatán soil did so by chance, as survivors of a shipwreck in the Caribbean. The Maya ritually sacrificed most of these men, leaving just two survivors, Gerónimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero, who somehow rejoined other Spaniards.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

In 1519, Aguilar accompanied [[Hernán Cortés|Hernán Cortez]] to the Yucatán island of [[Cozumel]], and also took part in the conquest of central Mexico. Guerrero became a Mexican legend as father of the first [[Mestizo]]: by Aguilar's account, Guerrero "went native." He married native women, wore traditional native apparel, and fought against the Spanish.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Maya World Yucatec Culture and Society, 1550-1850|last=Restall|first=Matthew|year=1999|isbn=0-8047-3658-8|location=Stanford, California| publisher=Stanford University Press|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2020}}

[[Francisco de Montejo]]'s military incursion of Yucatán took three generations and three wars with extended fighting, which lasted a total of 24 years.

The Maya had been in a stable decline when Spanish conquistadors arrived in 1517 AD. From 200 to 800 AD the Maya were thriving and making great technological advances. They created a system for recording numerals and hieroglyphs that was more complex and efficient than what had come before. They migrated northward and eastward to the Yucatán peninsula from Palenque, Jaina, and Bonampak. In the 12th and 13th centuries, a coalition emerged in the Yucatán peninsula among three important centers, Uxmal, Chichen Uitza, and Mayapan. The society grew and the people were able to practice intellectual and artistic achievement during a period of peace. When war broke out, such progress was stalled. By the 15th century, Mayan [[Toltec]] collapsed and was abandoned.

As the Spanish colonists settled more areas, in the 18th century they developed the lands for large maize and cattle plantations. The elite lived in haciendas and exported natural resources as commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://isa.unc.edu/language-programs/yucatec-maya-institute/about-the-yucatan/yucatan-history/|title=Yucatan History|website=Institute for the Study of the Americas|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maya were subjects of the Spanish Empire from 1542 to 1821.
[[File:Mayan languages tree en.svg|thumb|Language tree]]
During the colonization of the Yucatán peninsula, the Spanish believed that in order to evangelize and govern the Maya, they needed to reform Yucatec Maya. They wanted to shape it to serve their ends of religious conversion and social control.&lt;ref name="hanks"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanks|first=William F.|date=2012-01-01|title=BIRTH OF A LANGUAGE: The Formation and Spread of Colonial Yucatec Maya|jstor=24394197|journal=Journal of Anthropological Research|volume=68|issue=4|pages=449–471|doi=10.3998/jar.0521004.0068.401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish religious [[Missionary|missionaries]] undertook a project of linguistic and social transformation known as ''reducción'' (from Spanish ''reducir).'' &lt;!--  a term not widely recognized by historians.  What does this mean? Most historians don't use it? Why?--&gt; The missionaries translated Catholic Christian religious texts from Spanish into Yucatec Maya and created  [[neologism]]s to express Catholic religious concepts.  The result of this process of ''reducción'' was ''Maya reducido'', a semantically transformed version of Yucatec Maya.&lt;ref name="hanks"/&gt; Missionaries attempted to end Maya religious practices and destroy associated written works. By their translations, they also  shaped a language that was used to convert, subjugate, and govern the Maya population of the Yucatán peninsula. But Maya speakers appropriated ''Maya reducido'' for their own purposes, resisting colonial domination. The oldest written records in Maya reducido (which used the [[Roman alphabet]]) were written by Maya notaries between 1557 and 1851. These works can be found in the United States, Mexico, and Spain in libraries and archives&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Phonology==
A characteristic feature of Yucatec Maya, like other Mayan languages, is the use of [[ejective consonant]]s: {{IPA|/pʼ/, /tʼ/, /kʼ/}}. Often referred to as [[glottalization|glottal]]ized consonants, they are produced at the same place of oral articulation as their non-ejective stop counterparts: {{IPA|/p/, /t/, /k/}}. However, the release of the lingual closure is preceded by a raising of the closed glottis to increase the air pressure in the space between the glottis and the point of closure, resulting in a release with a characteristic ''popping'' sound. The sounds are written using an [[apostrophe]] after the letter to distinguish them from the plain consonants (''tʼàan'' "speech" vs. ''táan'' "forehead"). The apostrophes indicating the sounds were not common in written Maya until the 20th century but are now becoming more common. The Mayan ''b'' is also glottalized, an implosive {{IPA|/ɓ/}}, and is sometimes written ''bʼ'', but that is becoming less common.

Yucatec Maya is one of only three Mayan languages to have developed [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], the others being [[Uspantek language|Uspantek]] and one dialect of [[Tzotzil language|Tzotzil]]. Yucatec distinguishes short vowels and long vowels, indicated by single versus double letters (ii ee aa oo uu), and between high- and low-tone long vowels. High-tone vowels begin on a high pitch and fall in phrase-final position but rise elsewhere, sometimes without much vowel length. It is indicated in writing by an acute accent (íi ée áa óo úu). Low-tone vowels begin on a low pitch and are sustained in length; they are sometimes indicated in writing by a grave accent (ìi èe àa òo ùu).

Also, Yucatec has contrastive laryngealization ([[creaky voice]]) on long vowels, sometimes realized by means of a full intervocalic glottal stop and written as a long vowel with an apostrophe in the middle, as in the plural suffix ''-oʼob''.

† the letter '''w''' may represent the sounds {{IPA|[w]}} or {{IPA|[v]}}. The sounds are interchangeable in Yucatec Mayan although {{IPA|/w/}} is considered the proper sound.

Some sources describe the plain consonants as aspirated, but Victoria Bricker states "[s]tops that are not glottalized are articulated with lung air without aspiration as in English spill, skill, still."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bricker|first=Victoria|year=1998|title=Dictionary Of The Maya Language: As Spoken in Hocabá Yucatan|publisher=University of Utah Press|page=XII|isbn=978-0874805697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowels===
In terms of vowel quality, Yucatec Maya has a straight-forward five vowel system:

{| class="wikitable"
!
! [[Front vowel|Front]]
! [[Back vowel|Back]]
|- align="center"
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
| {{IPA|i}}
| {{IPA|u}}
|- align="center"
! [[Mid vowel|Mid]]
| {{IPA|e}}
| {{IPA|o}}
|- align="center"
! [[Open vowel|Open]]
| colspan="2" | {{IPA|a}}
|}

For each of these five vowel qualities, the language contrasts four distinct vowel "shapes", i.e. combinations of [[vowel length]], [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], and [[phonation]]. In the standard orthography first adopted in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cofemersimir.gob.mx/expediente/20612/mir/43270/anexo/3733913&lt;/ref&gt; vowel length is indicated by digraphs (e.g. "aa" for IPA {{IPA|[aː]}}).

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Short, neutral tone !! Long, low tone !! Long, high tone !! Creaky voiced ('glottalized,&lt;br&gt;rearticulated'), long, high tone
|-
| pik 'eight thousand' {{IPA|[pik]}} || miis 'cat' {{IPA|[mìːs]}} || míis {{IPA|[míːs]}} 'broom; to sweep' || niʼichʼ {{IPA|[nḭ́ːtʃʼ]}} 'to get bitten'
|}

In fast-paced speech, the glottalized long vowels may be pronounced the same as the plain long high vowels, so in such contexts ''ka’an'' {{IPA|[ká̰ːn]}} 'sky' sounds the same as ''káan'' {{IPA|[káːn]}} 'when?'.

===Stress===
Mayan words are typically stressed on the earliest syllable with a long vowel. If there is no long vowel, then the last syllable is stressed. Borrowings from other languages such as Spanish or Nahuatl are often stressed as in the original languages.

===Debuccalization===
An important [[morphophonology|morphophonological]] process in Yucatec Maya is the [[dissimilation]] of identical consonants next to each other by [[debuccalization|debuccalizing]] to avoid [[geminate consonant]]s. If a word ends in one of the [[glottalization|glottalized]] plosives /pʼ tʼ kʼ ɓ/ and is followed by an identical consonant, the final consonant may dispose of its [[point of articulation]] and become the glottal stop /ʔ/. This may also happen before another plosive inside a common idiomatic phrase or [[compound word]]. Examples: {{IPA|[mayaɓˈtʼàːn]}} ~ {{IPA|[majaʔˈtʼàːn]}} 'Yucatec Maya' (literally, "flat speech"), and ''náak’-'' {{IPA|[náːkʼ-]}} (a prefix meaning 'nearby') + ''káan'' {{IPA|[ká̰ːn]}} 'sky' gives {{IPA|[ˈnáːʔká̰ːn]}} 'palate, roof the mouth' (so literally "nearby-sky").

Meanwhile, if the final consonant is one of the other consonants, it debuccalizes to /h/: ''nak'' {{IPA|[nak]}} 'to stop sth' + ''-kúuns'' {{IPA|[-kúːns]}} (a [[causative]] suffix) gives ''nahkúuns'' {{IPA|[nahˈkúːns]}} 'to support sb/sth' (cf. the [[homophone]]s ''nah'', possessed form ''nahil'', 'house'; and ''nah'', possessed form ''nah'', 'obligation'), ''náach’'' {{IPA|[náːtʃ]}} 'far' + ''-chah'' {{IPA|[-tʃah]}} (an [[inchoative]] suffix) gives ''náahchah'' {{IPA|[ˈnáːhtʃah]}} 'to become distant'.

This change in the final consonant is often reflected in orthographies, so {{IPA|[majaʔˈtʼàːn]}} can appear as ''maya’ t’àan'', ''maya t'aan'', etc.

===Acquisition===
Phonology acquisition is received idiosyncratically. If a child seems to have severe difficulties with affricates and sibilants, another might have no difficulties with them while having significant problems with sensitivity to semantic content, unlike the former child.&lt;ref name="Straight, Henry Stephen 1976 207-18"&gt;Straight, Henry Stephen (1976) "The Acquisition of Maya Phonology Variation in Yucatec Child Language" in Garland Studies in American Indian Linguistics. pp.207-18&lt;/ref&gt;

There seems to be no incremental development in phonology patterns. Monolingual children learning the language have shown acquisition of aspiration and deobstruentization but difficulty with sibilants and affricates, and other children show the reverse. Also, some children have been observed fronting palatoalveolars, others retract lamino-alveolars, and still  others retract both.&lt;ref name="Straight, Henry Stephen 1976 207-18"/&gt;

Glottalization was not found to be any more difficult than aspiration. That is significant with the Yucatec Mayan use of ejectives. Glottal constriction is high in the developmental hierarchy, and features like [fricative], [apical], or [fortis] are found to be later acquired.&lt;ref name="Straight, Henry Stephen 1976"&gt;Straight, Henry Stephen 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
Like almost all Mayan languages, Yucatec Maya is verb-initial. Word order varies between [[Verb–object–subject|VOS]] and VSO, with VOS being the most common. Many sentences may appear to be SVO, but this order is due to a [[topic–comment]] system similar to that of Japanese. One of the most widely studied areas of Yucatec is the semantics of time in the language. Yucatec, like many other languages of the world ([[Kalaallisut]], arguably [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]] and others) does not have the grammatical category of [[Grammatical tense|tense]]. Temporal information is encoded by a combination of [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], inherent lexical aspect (''[[Lexical aspect|aktionsart]]''), and pragmatically governed conversational inferences. Yucatec is unusual in lacking temporal connectives such as 'before' and 'after'. Another aspect of the language is the core-argument marking strategy, which is a '[[fluid S]] system' in the typology of Dixon (1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dixon, Robert M. W.   |authorlink=R. M. W. Dixon |year=1994 |title=Ergativity |url=https://archive.org/details/ergativity0000dixo   |url-access=registration   |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-44898-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; where intransitive subjects are encoded like agents or patients based upon a number of semantic properties as well as the perfectivity of the event.

==Orthography==
The Maya were literate in [[pre-Columbian]] times, when the language was written using [[Maya script]]. The language itself can be traced back to proto-Yucatecan, the ancestor of modern Yucatec Maya, [[Itza language|Itza]], [[Lacandon language|Lacandon]] and [[Mopan language|Mopan]]. Even further back, the language is ultimately related to all other Maya languages through [[proto-Mayan]] itself.

Yucatec Maya is now written in the [[Latin script]]. This was introduced during the [[Spanish Conquest of Yucatán]] which began in the early 16th century, and the now-antiquated conventions of [[Spanish orthography]] of that period ("Colonial orthography") were adapted to transcribe Yucatec Maya. This included the use of '''x''' for the [[Voiceless postalveolar fricative|postalveolar fricative]] sound (which is often written in English as '''sh'''), a sound that in Spanish has since turned into a [[voiceless velar fricative|velar fricative]] nowadays spelled '''j'''.

In colonial times a "reversed c" (ɔ) was often used to represent {{IPA|[tsʼ]}}, which is now more usually represented with {{angle bracket|dz}} (and with {{angle bracket|tzʼ}} in the revised ALMG orthography).
