'''Censorship by Apple''' refers to [[Apple Inc.]]'s removal, omission, or disruption of the spread of content or information from its services or subsidiaries, such as the [[iTunes Store]] and the [[App Store (iOS)]], in order to comply with Apple's company policies, legal demands, or various government censorship laws.

==iTunes Books==
The iBooks description for ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' censored [[sperm whale]] as of April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/05/apple-ibooks-censors-sper_n_525564.html |title=Apple iBooks Censors 'Sperm'? |access-date=May 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510065452/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/05/apple-ibooks-censors-sper_n_525564.html |archive-date=May 10, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', four erotic books, including ''Blonde and Wet, the Complete Story'', were allegedly removed from the top 10 chart on July 26, 2010.&lt;ref name='Blake 2010-06-27'&gt;{{cite news | first = Heidi | last = Blake | title = Apple accused of censorship after porn disappears from iPad book chart | date = June 27, 2010 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/7911821/Apple-accused-of-censorship-after-porn-disappears-from-iPad-book-chart.html | work = The Telegraph | accessdate = May 31, 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130127200919/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/7911821/Apple-accused-of-censorship-after-porn-disappears-from-iPad-book-chart.html | archive-date = January 27, 2013 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Northwest Press]] has had repeated conflicts with Apple's content limitations on sales through the iBooks store. In 2011, an adaptation by [[Tom Bouden]] of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s play ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' was only approved after the addition of black bars to cover partial male nudity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/08/15/gay-comics-publisher-declares-victory-over-apple/|title=Gay Comics Publisher Declares Victory Over Apple|date=2011-08-15|website=Bleeding Cool Comic Book, Movie, TV News|access-date=2017-02-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080718/https://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/08/15/gay-comics-publisher-declares-victory-over-apple/|archive-date=February 11, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology company initially permitted the individual issues of [[Jon Macy]]'s ''Fearful Hunter'', but rejected the collected edition, then removed the issues.&lt;ref name="advocate"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/geek/2014/12/21/gay-comic-publisher-undaunted-apples-ibook-censorship|title=Gay Comic Publisher Undaunted by Apple's iBook Censorship|date=2014-12-21|access-date=2017-02-10|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318124041/http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/geek/2014/12/21/gay-comic-publisher-undaunted-apples-ibook-censorship|archive-date=March 18, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cbldf.org/2014/12/northwest-press-continues-to-challenge-apple-store-content-policies/|title=Northwest Press Defies Apple Censorship of LGBT Content {{!}} Comic Book Legal Defense Fund|website=cbldf.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211081343/http://cbldf.org/2014/12/northwest-press-continues-to-challenge-apple-store-content-policies/|archive-date=February 11, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satirical ''Al-Qaeda's Super Secret Weapon'' was rejected outright.&lt;ref name="advocate" /&gt; In 2016, Northwest published a self-censored version of ''Hard to Swallow'' by [[Justin Hall (cartoonist)|Justin Hall]] and Dave Davenport – covering the "objectionable" parts with images of apples – when the original version was rejected due to sexual content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/northwest-press-hard-to-swallow-apple-ban-protest/|title=Northwest Press Protests iBooks Ban With 'Apple Version'|website=Comics Alliance|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211075810/http://comicsalliance.com/northwest-press-hard-to-swallow-apple-ban-protest/|archive-date=February 11, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==iTunes Music==

===Song censorship===
There is a policy of censoring [[profanity]] in song titles on iTunes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/oct/27/itunes-swear-words-censorship The songs that are too rude for iTunes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221074547/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/oct/27/itunes-swear-words-censorship |date=December 21, 2016 }}, Michael Cragg, ''[[The Guardian]]'' October 27, 2008. Retrieved October 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in a [[Scunthorpe problem|Scunthorpe glitch]], by which inoffensive titles are censored due to a coincidental string of letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7688705.stm |title=iTunes glitch censors song titles, Friday 24 October 2008 |access-date=May 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103085222/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7688705.stm |archive-date=January 3, 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the song has an explicit label, it will be marked "explicit" next to the song title. If a song is marked "explicit" it is unavailable for purchase if "restrict explicit content" is checked under the parental controls preference. Often there will be a "clean" mark next to the title of some songs, meaning the lyrics have been censored, and is available to purchase on all accounts. Generally, if a song is marked "clean" there is an explicit version available as well.

==iTunes Podcasts==
===''InfoWars''===
On August 6, 2018, Apple removed all but one of the podcasts created by ''[[InfoWars]]'', a website owned by [[Alex Jones]], a right-wing American [[conspiracy theorist]] radio-show host and content creator. Apple cited [[hate speech]] as the reason for the removal of the content.&lt;ref name="AJ1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nicas |first1=Jack |title=Alex Jones and Infowars Content Is Removed From Apple, Facebook and YouTube |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/technology/infowars-alex-jones-apple-facebook-spotify.html |accessdate=11 December 2018 |agency=The New York Times |issue=Aug. 6, 2018 |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=6 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181212102009/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/technology/infowars-alex-jones-apple-facebook-spotify.html |archive-date=December 12, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AJ2"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nicas |first1=Jack |title=Gatekeepers or Censors?

==App Store==

=== Newspaper and magazine content ===
In May 2009, Apple rejected the first version of "Newspapers", an [[iPhone]] app that let users read content from 50+ newspapers around the world, including the ''[[New York Times]]'', [[France]]'s ''[[Le Monde]]'', and the [[United Kingdom]] tabloid ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''. The app was rejected because the topless "[[Page Three|Page 3]]" girls daily features were described as "obscene". A second version of the application was submitted, removing access to ''The Sun'', and adding a price tag of [[Pound sterling|£]]0.59. The app was made available in the summer, after the release of the [[iPhone]] 3.0 software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/may/06/sun-newsinternational |title=The Sun's 'obscene' Page 3 girls get iPhone newspaper app banned by Apple |newspaper=Guardian |date=May 6, 2009 |accessdate=December 2, 2009 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222185429/http://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/may/06/sun-newsinternational |archive-date=February 22, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sherwood |first=James |url=http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2009/05/05/the_sun_app_ban/ |title=Apple bans Page 3 from iPhone app |publisher=Reghardware.co.uk |date=May 5, 2009 |access-date=December 2, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126013657/http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2009/05/05/the_sun_app_ban/ |archive-date=November 26, 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another application, of similar nature to 'Newspapers', called 'Eucalyptus' allowed users to download [[e-books]] to their iPhone, though was rejected by Apple because one of the e-books that could have been downloaded was the ''[[Kama Sutra]]''. The ban has since been lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Logged in as click here to log out |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/may/24/iphone-ban-eucalyptus |title=Apple backtracks over ban on ebook application Eucalyptus &amp;#124; Technology &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |newspaper=Guardian |accessdate=December 2, 2009 |location=London |date=May 24, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906134415/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/may/24/iphone-ban-eucalyptus |archive-date=September 6, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The App Store has [[Playboy]] and [[Sports Illustrated]] adult-rated apps &lt;!-- App Store descriptions of apps Playboy version 1.0.22, Playboy Poker Version 1.0, SI Swimsuit 2010 Version 1.2 and Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Challenge Version 3.0  include "You must be at least 17 years old to download this application" --&gt; that have yet to be removed, while some apps by others were removed citing adult content which has resulted in accusations of hypocrisy.

November 26, 2010, an informational magazine about Google's OS from the Danish publisher  ''Mediaprovider'' wasn't allowed in the app store.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/11/26/apple-bans-android-magazine-app/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 25, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608031650/http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/11/26/apple-bans-android-magazine-app/ |archive-date=June 8, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' described rejection of explicit content by Apple as analogous to that of the distributor [[WH Smith]], a main distributor which for many years imposed content restrictions on British publishers.  Workers at the fashion magazine ''[[Dazed &amp; Confused (magazine)|Dazed &amp; Confused]]'' have nicknamed their iPad edition the "[[Iran]] edition".&lt;ref name="Schofield"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/may/10/ipad-apple|title=Wikipedia's porn purge, and cleaning up for the iPad|author=Jack Schofield|date=May 10, 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=December 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104202826/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/may/10/ipad-apple|archive-date=November 4, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoons ===
In December 2009, Apple banned a cartoon app called NewsToons by cartoonist [[Mark Fiore]], on the grounds that it "ridiculed public figures."&lt;ref name=pulitzer&gt;{{cite magazine

Fiore said, "Sure, mine might get approved, but what about someone who hasn't won a Pulitzer and who is maybe making a better political app than mine?  Do you need some media frenzy to get an app approved that has political material?"&lt;ref name=resubmit&gt;{{cite news

===''Baby Shaker''===
In April 2009, a game called ''Baby Shaker'' was approved for the App Store then later removed due to complaints. The game allowed the user to shake their phone until an image of a cartoon baby on the screen died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8015876.stm |title=Baby Shaker Game Causes Outrage &amp;#124; BBC |work=BBC News |date=April 24, 2009 |accessdate=December 2, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427192608/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8015876.stm |archive-date=April 27, 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nine Inch Nails===
In May 2009, [[Trent Reznor]] of the [[rock band]] [[Nine Inch Nails]] announced, via his [[Twitter]] account, that Apple had rejected an update to the Nine Inch Nails application due to "objectionable content".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=trent_reznor |url=https://twitter.com/trent_reznor |title=Trent Reznor (trent_reznor) on Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=December 2, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406121813/https://twitter.com/trent_reznor |archive-date=April 6, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The developer posted a message on the Nine Inch Nails discussion boards explaining the situation further:

{{quote|v1.0 is live. v1.0.3 got rejected due to content yet the app has no content in it. this was mainly a stability release to fix the bug that crashes the app for international users. the bug was fixed 24 hours after 1.0 went live and we have been waiting for apple to approve it ever since. meanwhile the app continues to get a growing number of 1 star ratings from international users understandably frustrated by the bug. but looks like our hands are tied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.nin.com/bb/read.php?9,651569,651866#msg-651866 |title=NIN iPhone app rejection |publisher=Forum.nin.com |date= |access-date=July 23, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507182214/http://forum.nin.com/bb/read.php?9%2C651569%2C651866#msg-651866 |archive-date=May 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===iPhone eBook===
In December 2009, Ted Lando's eBook app "Take Control of iPhone OS 3" was rejected by Apple. The app was not permitted back into the app store until all references to jailbreaking were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/rejected_by_apple |title=Rejected By Apple |publisher=Mac Observer |accessdate=June 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918081915/https://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/rejected_by_apple |archive-date=September 18, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phone Story===
In 2011, Apple banned a game called ''[[Phone Story]]'' that explored the ethical challenges of smartphone manufacturing, including [[conflict minerals]], environmental waste, and troubled labor practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dredge|first=Stuart|title=Apple bans satirical iPhone game Phone Story from its App Store|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2011/sep/14/apple-phone-story-rejection|accessdate=March 15, 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=September 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315101214/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2011/sep/14/apple-phone-story-rejection|archive-date=March 15, 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was eventually published on the web by its creator [[Molleindustria]].

===Drone Strike Alert===
In August 2012, [[Josh Begley]] created an iPhone app that sent out a [[Push technology|push notification]] whenever a U.S. military [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]] struck a target. The app was rejected because of Apple finding the content "objectionable and crude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/27914/apple-bans-drone-strike-app/ |title=Apple bans ‘drone strike’ app |publisher=Infosecurity Magazine |date= |accessdate=November 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027172616/http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/view/27914/apple-bans-drone-strike-app |archive-date=October 27, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational app===
In July 2013, a tech education startup called Treehouse claimed that Apple had refused to let them release an iOS app that contained lessons about Android.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/07/25/tech-education-startup-treehouse-branches-out-to-the-ipad/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711064733/https://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/07/25/tech-education-startup-treehouse-branches-out-to-the-ipad/ |archive-date=July 11, 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Papers, Please''===
The video game ''[[Papers, Please]]'', centered around the operation of a border checkpoint, was brought to iPad in December 2014, but developer Lucas Pope was forced to remove some pixellated nudity from the game's full-body scanner to be allowed to release the game for Apple devices.&lt;ref name="arstechnica.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pope|first1=Lucas|title=Apple forces nude immigrants to cover up in iPad version of Papers, Please|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/12/apple-forces-nude-immigrants-to-cover-up-in-ipad-version-of-papers-please/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=December 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212051050/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/12/apple-forces-nude-immigrants-to-cover-up-in-ipad-version-of-papers-please/|archive-date=December 12, 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a few days, Pope was permitted to upload a full version of the game to the App Store including pixellated nudity in an apparent reversal by Apple.&lt;ref name="arstechnica.com"/&gt; However, it is still rated 17+ on the App Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/app/papers-please/id935216956 |title=Papers, Please on the App Store |publisher=App Store |access-date=December 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151013081617/https://itunes.apple.com/app/papers-please/id935216956 |archive-date=October 13, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''France Musique'' app removal===
On May 4, 2015, Apple removed the [[France Musique]] application from its App store due to the airing of "inappropriate content" in a podcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=Apple a depublié l'appli @francemusique pour cause de contenus adultes|url=https://twitter.com/laurentfrisch/status/595200010129661952|website=Twitter|accessdate=May 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305151712/https://twitter.com/laurentfrisch/status/595200010129661952|archive-date=March 5, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application displayed a painting by Édouard Manet, [[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]], depicting mild nudity.

=== Chaos Computer Club videos about security vulnerabilities ===
In October 2015, Apple rejected a custom streaming application for Apple TV that was created by some members of the [[Frankfurt]] branch of [[Chaos Computer Club]], Europe's largest hacker association. The application was meant to show recordings of talks from Chaos Computer Club's conferences. According to a blog post that was written about the incident, Apple's reason was because "some of the videos show how to hack Apple devices".{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The recordings are publicly available and are hosted on YouTube as well. Using the YouTube app still allows playback of the content on Apple devices.

===''Binding of Isaac''===

Apple banned the video game ''[[The Binding of Isaac (video game)|The Binding of Isaac]]'' from appearing in the iOS App Store due to its cartoon depictions of violence towards children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grubb|first1=Jeff|title=Apple’s gaming censorship continues: The Binding of Isaac blocked from App Store|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/02/07/apples-gaming-censorship-continues-the-binding-of-isaac-blocked-from-app-store/|accessdate=9 March 2016|work=VentureBeat|date=7 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727181942/https://venturebeat.com/2016/02/07/apples-gaming-censorship-continues-the-binding-of-isaac-blocked-from-app-store/|archive-date=July 27, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical games===
In December 2018, Apple removed the strategy game ''Afghanistan '11'' due to the fact that it featured real-life combatants. Slitherine, the developers of the game, countered that the main objectives focused on supporting Afghan civilians rather than defeating the Taliban. This followed a temporary ban of the game ''Ultimate General: Gettysburg'' for featuring the Confederate flag in historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/6/18128924/afghanistan-11-taliban-app-store-removed|title=Afghanistan '11, game with US and Taliban forces, removed from app store|first=Charlie|last=Hall|website=Polygon|date=2018-12-06|accessdate=2018-12-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181223120950/https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/6/18128924/afghanistan-11-taliban-app-store-removed|archive-date=December 23, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HKmap===
In October 2019, Apple removed the [[HKmap.live]] app from its App Store. HKMap is used to track the locations of protests and police in [[Hong Kong]]. Apple stated that the app "allowed users to evade law enforcement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49919459 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=October 3, 2019 |title=Apple bans Hong Kong protest location app |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003192254/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49919459 |archive-date=October 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship by country==
The following are instances of censorship and information control imposed by Apple in App Stores other than the United States App Store. Many were imposed due to pressure from foreign governments and were put into effect to comply with laws.

===China===
As early as 2017, Apple restricted the [[emoji]] of the [[flag of the Republic of China]] on devices used in [[mainland China]].&lt;ref name="Taiwan Flag"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Horwitz |first1=Josh |title=You can't use the Taiwan flag emoji on a Chinese iPhone |url=https://qz.com/1250884/you-cant-use-the-taiwan-flag-emoji-on-a-chinese-iphone/ |website=Quartz |publisher=Quartz |accessdate=11 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215223255/https://qz.com/1250884/you-cant-use-the-taiwan-flag-emoji-on-a-chinese-iphone/ |archive-date=December 15, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Apple's restrictions on sending the word "[[Taiwan]]" or sending an [[emoji]] representing the [[Flag of the Republic of China|flag of Taiwan]] on [[iDevices]] using a Chinese [[country code]] or language settings caused the devices to crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/07/iphone-crashing-bug-likely-caused-by-code-added-to-appease-chinese-govt/ |title=iPhone crashing bug likely caused by code added to appease Chinese gov't |first=Dan |last=Goodin |date=July 10, 2018 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |access-date=July 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710233131/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/07/iphone-crashing-bug-likely-caused-by-code-added-to-appease-chinese-govt/ |archive-date=July 10, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x34.html |title=A Remote iOS Bug |date=July 10, 2018 |first=Patrick |last=Wardle |publisher=objective-see llc |archive-url=https://archive.today/20180710233321/https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x34.html |archive-date=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/story/apple-china-censorship-bug-iphone-crash-emoji |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |title=Apple's China-Friendly Censorship Caused an iPhone-Crashing Bug |date=July 10, 2018 |first=Andy |last=Greenberg |quote=Since at least early 2017, iOS has included that Chinese censorship function: Switch your iPhone's location setting to China, and the Taiwanese flag emoji essentially disappears from your phone, evaporating from its library of emojis and appearing as a "missing" emoji in any text that appears on the screen.

In 2018, Apple removed apps from the Chinese App Store that allowed users to access content forbidden by the Chinese government. Many of these apps gave users access to [[virtual private network]]s that could allow them to circumvent the [[Great Firewall of China]]. Apple did not cite any Chinese laws, but claimed that the apps broke the laws of their local governments. Among the apps removed was [[VyprVPN]], an app by Golden Frog, a company which had filed an ''[[amicus curiae|amicus]]'' brief supporting Apple during the [[FBI–Apple encryption dispute]]. Apple is the first foreign global technology company to concede to the Chinese government's demands.&lt;ref name="Apple China Apps"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mozur |first1=Paul |title=Apple Removes Apps From China Store That Help Internet Users Evade Censorship |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/29/technology/china-apple-censorhip.html |accessdate=11 December 2018 |agency=The New York Times |issue=Jul. 29, 2018 |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=29 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209160530/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/29/technology/china-apple-censorhip.html |archive-date=December 9, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
In February 2017, Apple restricted payment services in Iranian apps to comply with U.S. sanctions that forbade Iranian currency from entering the United States.&lt;ref name="Apple US Sanctions Iran"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Erdbrink |first1=Thomas |last2=Goel |first2=Vindu |title=Apple, Citing U.S. Sanctions, Removes Popular Apps in Iran |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/technology/apple-iran.html |accessdate=11 December 2018 |agency=The New York Times |issue=Aug. 24, 2018 |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=24 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215232645/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/technology/apple-iran.html |archive-date=December 15, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iranian apps responded by implementing an Iranian electronic payment service.&lt;ref name="Apple US Sanctions Iran" /&gt;
