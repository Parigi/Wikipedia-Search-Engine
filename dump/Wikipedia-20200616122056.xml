{{Roman government}}

The '''Roman provinces''' ([[Latin]]: ''provincia'', pl. ''provinciae'') were the administrative regions of the Roman Empire outside of Italy that were controlled by the Romans under the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] and later under the [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. Each province was ruled by a Roman appointed as governor.

==Overview==
A province was the basic and, until the [[tetrarchy]] (from 293 AD), the largest territorial and administrative unit of the empire's territorial possessions outside [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italy]]. The word ''province'' in [[Modern English]] has its origins in the Latin term used by the Romans.

Provinces were generally governed by politicians of [[Roman senate|senatorial]] rank, usually former [[Roman consul|consuls]] or former ''[[praetor]]s''. A later exception was the province of Egypt, incorporated by [[Augustus]] after the death of [[Cleopatra]]; it was ruled by a governor of only [[Equestrian order|equestrian]] rank, perhaps as a discouragement to senatorial ambition. This exception was unique, but not contrary to Roman law, as Egypt was considered Augustus' personal property, following the tradition of the [[Hellenistic Egypt|kings]] of the earlier [[Hellenistic period]].

The Latin term ''provincia'' also had a more general meaning of "jurisdiction".

== Republican provinces ==
The Latin word ''provincia'' originally meant any task or set of responsibilities assigned by the [[Roman Senate]] to an individual who held ''[[imperium]]'' (right of command), which was often a military command within a specified [[theater of operations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Richardson |chapter=Fines provinciae |title=Frontiers in the Roman World. Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop of the International Network Impact of Empire (Durhan, 16–19 April 2009) |publisher=Brill |year=2011 |page=2ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Administration of the Empire |journal=[[The Cambridge Ancient History]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1994 |volume=9 |pages=564–565, 580}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Roman Republic]], the [[Executive Magistrates of the Roman Republic|magistrates]] were elected to office for a period of one year, and those serving outside the city of Rome, such as [[Roman consul|consuls]] acting as generals on a [[military campaign]], were assigned a particular ''provincia'', the scope of authority within which they exercised their command.

The territory of a people who were defeated in war might be brought under various forms of [[treaty]], in some cases entailing complete subjection ''([[Jus gentium#Terminology|deditio]])''. The formal [[annexation]] of a territory created a province, in the modern sense of an administrative unit that is geographically defined. Republican-period provinces were administered in one-year terms by the consuls and ''[[praetor]]s'' who had held office the previous year and who were invested with ''imperium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Clifford |last=Ando |author-link=Clifford Ando |chapter=The Administration of the Provinces |title=A Companion to the Roman Empire |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishers]] |year=2010 |page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome started expanding beyond Italy during the [[First Punic War]]. The first permanent provinces to be annexed were [[Sicilia]] in 241&amp;nbsp;BC and [[Corsica et Sardinia]] in 237&amp;nbsp;BC. Militarized expansionism kept increasing the number of these administrative provinces, until there were no longer enough qualified individuals to fill the posts.

Corey |author-link=T. Corey Brennan |title=The Praetorship in the Roman Republic |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2000 |pages=626–627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms of provincial governors often had to be extended for multiple years ''([[prorogatio]])'', and on occasion the senate awarded ''imperium'' even to private citizens ''([[privatus|privati]])'', most notably [[Pompey the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lintott |first=Andrew |author-link=Andrew Lintott |title=The Constitution of the Roman Republic |page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brennan |first=T. Corey |author-link=T. Corey Brennan |title=The Praetorship in the Roman Republic |page=636}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prorogation undermined the [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|republican constitutional]] principle of annual elected magistracies, and the amassing of disproportionate wealth and military power by a few men through their provincial commands was a major factor in the transition from a republic to imperial [[autocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Claude |last=Nicolet |author-link=Claude Nicolet |title=Space, Geography, and Politics in the Early Roman Empire |url=https://archive.org/details/spacegeographypo00nico |url-access=registration |publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]] |year=1991 |orig-year=1988 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/spacegeographypo00nico/page/n9 1], 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Olivier |last=Hekster |first2=Ted |last2=Kaizer |title=Frontiers in the Roman World |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lintott |first=Andrew |author-link=Andrew Lintott |title=The Constitution of the Roman Republic |page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=W. |last=Eder |chapter=The Augustan Principate as Binding Link |title=Between Republic and Empire |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=1993 |page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== List of republican provinces ===
* 241 BC – [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicilia]] (Sicily) taken over from the [[Carthaginians]] and annexed at the end of the [[First Punic War]]
* 237 BC – [[Corsica et Sardinia]]; these two islands were taken over from the Carthaginians and annexed soon after the [[Mercenary War]], in 238 BC and 237 BC respectively
* 197 BC – [[Hispania Citerior]]; along the east coast of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]; part of the territories taken over from the Carthaginians
* 197 BC – [[Hispania Ulterior]]; along the southern coast of the Iberian Peninsula; part of the territories taken over from the Carthaginians in the [[Second Punic War]]
* 147 BC – [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] in mainland Greece. It was annexed after a rebellion by the [[Achaean League]].
* 146 BC – [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] (modern day [[Tunisia]] and western [[Libya]]) home territory of [[Carthage]]; annexed after the destruction of Carthage in the [[Third Punic War]]
* 129 BC – [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], formerly the [[Kingdom of Pergamon]], in western [[Anatolia]] (modern [[Turkey]]) by its last king, [[Attalus III]], in 133 BC
* 120 BC – [[Gallia Narbonensis]] (southern France); prior to its annexation it was called [[Gallia Transalpina]] (Gallia on the other side of [[the Alps]]) to distinguish it from [[Gallia Cisalpina]] (Gaul on this same side of the Alps, in northern Italy). It was annexed following attacks on the allied Greek city of Massalia ([[Marseille]]).
* 67 BC – [[Creta et Cyrenaica|Creta et Cyrenae]]; [[Cyrenaica]] was bequeathed to Rome in 78 BC. However, it was not organised as a province. It was incorporated into the province of Creta et Cyrenae when [[Crete]] was annexed in 67 BC.
* 63 BC – [[Bithynia et Pontus|Pontus et Bithynia]]; the [[Kingdom of Bithynia]] (in North-western Anatolia – Turkey) was bequeathed to Rome by its last king, [[Nicomedes IV]] in 74 BC. It was organised as a Roman province at the end of the [[Third Mithridatic War]] (73–63 BC) by [[Pompey]], who incorporated the eastern part of the defeated [[Kingdom of Pontus]] into it in 63 BC.
* 63 BC – [[Roman Syria|Syria]]; Pompey annexed [[Syria]] at the end of the Third Mithridatic War
* 58 BC – [[Cilicia (Roman province)|Cilicia et Cyprus]]; [[Cilicia]] was created as a province in the sense of area of military command in 102 BC in a campaign against [[piracy]]. The Romans controlled only a small area. In 74 BC [[Lycia]] and [[Pamphylia]] (to the east) were added to the small Roman possessions in Cilicia. Cilicia came fully under Roman control towards the end of the Third Mithridatic War – 73–63 BC. The province was reorganised by Pompey in 63 BC. [[Cyprus]] was annexed and added to this province in 58 BC.
* 46 BC – Africa Nova (eastern [[Numidia]] – Algeria), Julius Caesar annexed eastern Numidia and the new province called Africa Nova (new Africa) to distinguish it from the older province of Africa, which become known as Africa Vetus (old Africa).

[[Gallia Cisalpina]] (in northern [[Italy]]) was a province in the sense of an area of military command, but was never a province in the sense of an administrative unit. During Rome's expansion in the [[Italian peninsula]], the Romans assigned some areas as provinces in the sense of areas of military command assigned to [[consul]]s and ''[[praetor]]s'' (not proconsuls or ''propraetors'' as in the case of administrative provinces) due to risks of rebellions or invasions. This was applied to [[Liguria]] because there was a series of rebellions, [[Bruttium]] and to ([[Calabria]]) because of perceived risks of rebellion.

In the early days of the Roman presence in Gallia Cisalpina, the issue was rebellion. Later, the issue was risk of invasions by warlike peoples east of Italy. The city of [[Aquileia]] was founded to protect northern Italy from invasions. [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]] granted the inhabitants of this region Roman citizenship and incorporated the region into Italy.

== Imperial provinces during the ''principate'' ==
[[File:RomanEmpire 117.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|right|The Roman Empire at its greatest extent, under [[Trajan]] (117); [[imperial province]]s are shaded green, [[senatorial province]]s are shaded pink, and [[client state]]s are shaded gray]]

In the so-called [[Augustus#First settlement|Augustan Settlement]] of 27&amp;nbsp;BC which established the [[Roman Empire]], the governance of the provinces was regulated. [[Augustus|Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus]], having emerged from the [[Roman civil wars]] as the undisputed victor and master of the Roman state, officially laid down his powers, and in theory restored the authority of the [[Roman Senate]]. Octavian himself assumed the title "[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]" and was given to govern, in addition to Egypt, the strategically important provinces of [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], [[Hispania]] and [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] (including [[Cilicia]] and [[Cyprus]]).

Under Augustus, Roman provinces were classified as either public or imperial, meaning that their governors were appointed by either the senate or by the emperor. Generally, the older provinces that existed under the republic were public. Public provinces were, as before under the republic, governed by a [[proconsul]], who was chosen by lot among the ranks of senators who were ex-[[consuls]] or ex-''[[praetors]]'', depending on the province assigned.

The major imperial provinces were under a ''[[legatus Augusti pro praetore]]'', also a senator of consular or praetorian rank. Egypt and some smaller provinces where no legions were based were ruled by a ''[[procurator (Roman)|procurator]]'' (''praefectus'' in Egypt), whom the emperor selected from non-senators of [[equestrian order|equestrian]] rank.

The status of a province could change from time to time. In AD&amp;nbsp;68, of a total 36 provinces, 11 were public and 25 imperial. Of the latter, 15 were under ''legati'' and 10 under ''procuratores'' or ''praefecti''.

During the ''[[principate]]'', the number and size of provinces also changed, either through conquest or through the division of existing provinces. The larger or more heavily garrisoned provinces (for example [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and [[Moesia]]) were subdivided into smaller provinces to prevent any single governor from holding too much power.

=== List of provinces created during the ''principate'' ===

==== Under Augustus ====
* 30 BC – [[Egypt (Roman province)|Aegyptus]], taken over by [[Augustus]] after his defeat of [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra VIII of Egypt|Cleopatra VII of Egypt]] in 30 BC. It was the first imperial province in that it was Augustus' own domain as the Egyptians recognised him as their new [[pharaoh]]. Its proper initial name was Alexandrea et Aegyptus. It was governed by Augustus' ''praefectus'', Alexandreae et Aegypti.
* 27 BC – [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaia]] (southern and central Greece), Augustus separated it from [[Roman province of Macedonia|Macedonia]] (senatorial propraetorial province)
* 27 BC – [[Hispania Tarraconensis]]; former [[Hispania Citerior]] (northern, central and eastern Spain), created with the reorganisation of the provinces in Hispania by Augustus (imperial proconsular province).
* 27 BC – [[Hispania Baetica]]; former [[Hispania Ulterior]] (southern [[Spain]]); created with the reorganisation of the provinces in Hispania by Augustus (senatorial ''propraetorial'' province). The name derives from Betis, the Latin name for the [[Guadalquivir]] River.
* 27 BC – [[Lusitania]] ([[Portugal]] and [[Extremadura]] in Spain), created with the reorganisation of the provinces in Hispania by Augustus (imperial proconsular province)
* 27 BC – [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], Augustus conquered [[Illyria]] and southern [[Pannonia]] in 35–33 BC. Created as a senatorial province in 27 BC. Northern Pannonia was conquered during the Pannonian War (14–10 BC). Subdivided into [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] (a new name for Illyria) and Pannonia, which were officially called Upper and Lower Illyricum respectively in 9 BC, towards the end of the [[Batonian War]]. Initially a senatorial province, it became an imperial ''propraetorial'' province in 11 BC, during the Pannonian War. It was dissolved and the new provinces of Dalmatia and Pannonia were created during the reign of [[Vespasian]] (69–79). In 107 Pannonia was divided into [[Pannonia Superior]] and [[Pannonia Inferior]] – imperial provinces (proconsular and ''propraetorial'' respectively).
* 27 BC or 16–13 BC – [[Aquitania]] (south-western France) province created in the territories in [[Gaul]] conquered by [[Julius Caesar]]; there is uncertainty as to whether it was created with Augustus’ first visit and the first [[census]] on Gaul or during Augustus' visit in 16–13 (imperial proconsular province)
* 27 BC or 16–13 BC – [[Gallia Lugdunensis]] (central and part of northern France) province created in the territories in Gaul conquered by Julius Caesar; there is uncertainty as to whether it was created with Augustus’ first visit and the first census on Gaul or during Augustus’ visit in 16–13 (imperial proconsular province)
* 27 BC or 16–13 BC – [[Gallia Belgica]] ([[Netherlands]] south of the Rhine river, [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], part of northern France and Germany west of the [[Rhine (river)|Rhine]]; there is uncertainty as to whether it was created with Augustus’ first visit and the first census on Gaul or during Augustus' visit in 16–13 (imperial proconsular province)

*  6 AD? – [[Moesia]] (on the east and south bank of the River Danube part of modern [[Serbia]], the north part of [[North Macedonia]], northern [[Bulgaria]]), Conquered in 28 BC, originally it was a military district under the province of Macedonia. The first mention of a provincial governor was for 6 AD, at the beginning of the [[Bellum Batonianum|Batonian War]]. In 85 Moesia was divided into [[Moesia Superior]] and [[Moesia Inferior]] (imperial proconsular provinces).
*  6 AD – [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]], imperial ''procuratorial province'' (reverted to status of client kingdom in 41 AD and became province again in 44 AD; renamed [[Syria Palaestina]] by [[Hadrian]] in 135 AD and upgraded to proconsular province).

==== Under Tiberius ====
* 17 AD – [[Cappadocia (Roman province)|Cappadocia]] (central Anatolia – Turkey); imperial ''propraetorial'' (later proconsular) province.

==== Under Claudius ====
* 42 AD – [[Mauretania Tingitana]] (northern [[Morocco]]); after the death of [[Ptolemy of Mauretania|Ptolemy]], the last king of Mauretania, in 40 AD, his kingdom was annexed. It was begun by [[Caligula]] and was completed by [[Claudius]] with the defeat of the rebels. In 42 AD, Claudius divided it into two provinces (imperial ''procuratorial'' province).
* 42 AD – [[Mauretania Caesariensis]], (western and central [[Algeria]]), after the death of Ptolemy, the last king of Mauretania, in 40 AD, his kingdom was annexed. It was begun by Caligula and was completed by Claudius with the defeat of the rebels. In 42 AD Claudius divided it into two provinces( imperial ''procuratorial'' province).
*  41/53 AD – [[Noricum]] (central [[Austria]], north-eastern [[Slovenia]] and part of [[Bavaria]]), it was incorporated into the empire in 16 BC. It was called a province, but it remained a client kingdom under the control of an imperial procurator. It was turned into a proper province during the reign of Claudius (41–54) (imperial ''propraetorial'' province).
* 43 AD – [[Roman Britain|Britannia]]; Claudius initiated the invasion of Britannia. Up to 60 AD, the Romans controlled the area south a line from the [[River Humber]] to the [[Severn Estuary]]. Wales was finally subdued in 78. In 78–84 [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]] conquered the north of England and Scotland. Scotland was then abandoned (imperial proconsular province). In 197 [[Septimius Severus]] divided Britannia into [[Britannia Superior]] and [[Britannia Inferior]]. Imperial provinces (proconsular and ''propraetorial'' respectively).
* 43 AD – [[Lycia]] annexed by Claudius (in 74 AD merged with [[Pamphylia]] to form [[Lycia et Pamphylia]]).

* 47 AD? – [[Alpes Poeninae|Alpes Atrectianae et Poeninae]] (between Italy and [[Switzerland]]), Augustus subdued its inhabitants, the Salassi, in 15 BC. It was incorporated into Raetia. The date of the creation of the province is uncertain. It is usually set at the date of Claudius' foundation of Forum Claudii Vallensium (Martigny), which became its capital (imperial ''procuratorial'' province).

==== Under Nero ====
* 63 AD? – [[Alpes Maritimae]] (on the [[French Alps]]), created as a protectorate by Augustus, it probably became a province under [[Nero]] when Alpes Cottiae became a province (imperial ''procuratorial'' province)
* 63 AD – [[Alpes Cottiae]] (between France and Italy), in 14 BC it became a nominal prefecture which was run by the ruling dynasty of the Cotii. It was named after the king, Marcus Julius Cottius. It became a province in 63 (imperial ''procuratorial'' province).

==== Under Vespasian ====
* 72 AD – [[Commagene]], its client king was deposed and Commagene was annexed to Syria.
* 74 AD – [[Lycia et Pamphylia]]. [[Vespasian]] (reigned AD 69–79) merged [[Lycia]], annexed by Claudius, and [[Pamphylia]] which had been a part of the province of [[Galatia (Roman province)|Galatia]].

==== Under Domitian ====
* 83/84 AD – [[Germania Superior]] (southern Germany) The push into southern Germany up to the [[Agri Decumates]] by [[Domitian]] created the necessity to create this province, which had been a military district in Gallia Belgica when it was restricted to the west bank of the River Rhine (imperial proconsular province).
* 83/84 AD – [[Germania Inferior]] ([[Netherlands]] south of the River [[Rhine]], part of [[Belgium]], and part of Germany west of the Rhine) originally a military district under Gallia Belgica, created when Germania Superior was created (imperial proconsular province).

Divided into [[Dacia Superior]] and [[Dacia Inferior]] in 158 by [[Antoninus Pius]]. Divided into three provinces ([[Tres Daciae]]) in 166 by [[Marcus Aurelius]]: Porolissensis, Apulensis and Malvensis (imperial ''procuratorial'' provinces). Abandoned by [[Aurelian]] in 271.
* 103/114 AD [[Epirus Nova]] (in western Greece and southern Albania), Epirus was originally under the province of Macedonia. It was placed under Achaia in 27 BC except for its northernmost part, which remained part of Macedonia. It became a separate province under Trajan, sometime between 103 and 114 AD and was renamed Epirus Nova (New Epirus) (imperial ''procuratorial'' province).
* 114 AD – [[Roman Armenia|Armenia]], annexed by Trajan, who deposed its client king. In 118 [[Hadrian]] restored this client kingdom
* 116 AD – [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]] ([[Iraq]]) seized from the Parthians and annexed by Trajan, who invaded the Parthian Empire in late 115. Given back to the Parthians by Hadrian in 118. In 198 [[Septimius Severus]] conquered a small area in the north and named it Mesopotamia. It was attacked twice by the Persians (imperial ''praefectorial'' province).
* 116 AD – [[Assyria (Roman province)|Assyria]], Trajan suppressed a revolt by Assyrians in Mesopotamia and created the province. Hadrian relinquished it in 118.

==== Under Caracalla ====
* 214 AD – [[Osrhoene]], this kingdom (in northern Mesopotamia, in parts of today's Iraq, Syria and Turkey) was annexed.

==== Under Aurelian ====
* 271 AD – [[Dacia Aureliana]] (most of Bulgaria and Serbia) created by [[Aurelian]] in the territory of the former Moesia Superior after his evacuation of Dacia Trajana beyond the River Danube.

:&lt;small&gt;Many of the above provinces were under Roman military control or under the rule of Roman clients for a long time before being officially constituted as civil provinces. Only the date of the official formation of the province is marked above, not the date of conquest.&lt;/small&gt;

{{see also|List of Late Roman provinces}}
[[File:The Roman Empire ca 400 AD.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The Roman Empire and its administrative divisions, c. 395]]
Emperor [[Diocletian]] introduced a radical reform known as the ''[[tetrarchy]]'' (284–305), with a western and an eastern ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' or senior emperor, each seconded by a junior emperor (and designated successor) styled ''[[Caesar (title)|caesar]]'', and each of these four defending and administering a quarter of the empire. In the 290s, Diocletian divided the empire anew into almost a hundred provinces, including [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italy]]. Their governors were hierarchically ranked, from the [[proconsul]]s of [[Africa Proconsularis]] and [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] through those governed by ''[[consularis|consulares]]'' and ''[[corrector]]es'' to the ''[[praeses|praesides]]''. These last were the only ones recruited from the [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian class]]. The provinces in turn were grouped into (originally twelve) [[Roman diocese|dioceses]], headed usually by a ''[[vicarius]]'', who oversaw their affairs. Only the proconsuls and the [[urban prefect]] of Rome (and later Constantinople) were exempt from this, and were directly subordinated to the tetrarchs.

Although the Caesars were soon eliminated from the picture, the four administrative resorts were restored in 318 by Emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine&amp;nbsp;I]], in the form of [[praetorian prefectures]], whose holders generally rotated frequently, as in the usual magistracies but without a colleague. Constantine also created a new capital, known after him as [[Constantinople]], which was sometimes called 'New Rome' because it became the permanent seat of the government. In Italy itself, Rome had not been the imperial residence for some time and 286 Diocletian formally moved the seat of government to [[Mediolanum]] (modern [[Milan]]), while taking up residence himself in [[Nicomedia]]. During the 4th century, the administrative structure was modified several times, including repeated experiments with Eastern-Western co-emperors. Provinces and dioceses were split to form new ones, the [[praetorian prefecture of Illyricum]] was abolished and reformed. In the end, with the rise of [[Odoacer]] in 476 and the death of [[Julius Nepos]] in 480, administration of the effectively reduced Empire was permanently unified in Constantinople.

Detailed information on the arrangements during this period is contained in the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'' (Record of Offices), a document dating from the early 5th century. Most data is drawn from this authentic imperial source, as the names of the areas governed and titles of the governors are given there. There are however debates about the source of some data recorded in the ''{{lang|la|Notitia}}'', and it seems clear that some of its own sources are earlier than others. It is interesting to compare this with the list of military territories under the ''[[Dux|duces]]'', in charge of border garrisons on so-called ''[[Limes (Roman Empire)|limites]]'', and the higher ranking ''{{lang|la|Comites rei militaris}}'', with more mobile forces, and the later, even higher [[Magister Militum|''magistri militum'']].

[[Justinian&amp;nbsp;I]] made the next great changes in 534–536 by abolishing, in some provinces, the strict separation of civil and military authority that Diocletian had established. This process was continued on a larger scale with the creation of extraordinary [[Exarchate]]s in the 580s and culminated with the adoption of the military [[theme system]] in the 640s, which replaced the older administrative arrangements entirely. Some scholars use the reorganization of the empire into [[Theme (Byzantine district)|themata]] in this period as one of the demarcations between the [[Dominate]] and the Byzantine (or the Later Roman) period. As a matter of scholarly convenience, the medieval phase of the Roman Empire is today conventionally referred to as [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], named after the original name of the city that Constantine rebuilt into the new capital of [[Constantinople]].
