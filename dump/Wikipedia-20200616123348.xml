[[Image:Steve jobs Macbook Air.jpg|thumb|alt=Man in black shirt and jeans holding tablet computer on stage|[[Steve Jobs]] introduces [[MacBook Air]] during keynote presentation at [[Macworld/iWorld|Macworld]] 2008. The event was his last Macworld appearance.]]
'''Stevenote''' is a colloquial term for [[keynote]] speeches given by [[Steve Jobs]], former [[CEO]] of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], at events such as the [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]], [[Macworld Expo]], and [[Apple Expo]]. Because most Apple product releases were first shown to the public at these keynotes, "Stevenotes" caused substantial swings in Apple's stock price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/05/23/apple_seen_unloading_new_macbook_pros_and_possibly_imacs_at_wwdc.html |title=Apple seen unloading new MacBook Pros and (possibly) iMacs at WWDC |last=Marshal |first=Katie |publisher=Apple Insider |date=2007-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jobs's final Stevenote was delivered on June 6, 2011, when he announced [[iCloud]] (Apple's [[cloud computing]] service). [[OS X Lion]] and [[iOS 5]] were also announced on the same day. It was one of his last public appearances before his resignation as CEO on August 24 and death on October 5 of that year.

==History==
In late 1996 Apple purchased [[NeXT]], and Jobs returned to Apple after an 11-year hiatus following his [[Steve Jobs#Beginnings of Apple Computer|forced resignation from the company]] in 1985. In mid-1997, he delivered a keynote address, with a detailed report on the company's status, featuring a [[satellite]] appearance by Microsoft CEO [[Bill Gates]]. Jobs announced a partnership with Microsoft with several key agreements which, according to him, would benefit Apple and allow it to recover from the prolonged decline of the early and mid-1990s. Two major announcements were made during the keynote: the next release of [[Microsoft Office]] (Office 98) would be developed for the Macintosh, and Microsoft's [[Internet Explorer for Mac|Internet Explorer]] would be the default [[web browser]] on Macintosh computers. Despite heckling from the audience, Jobs explained why the partnership was favorable to Apple:

{{Quote|text=The era of setting this up as a competition between Apple and Microsoft is over, as far as I'm concerned. This is about getting Apple healthy, and this is about Apple being able to make incredibly great contributions to the industry to get healthy and prosper again. |author=Steve Jobs |source= ''Mac History'' (6 August 1997), Christoph Dernbach&lt;!-- |url=http://www.mac-history.net/apple-history-tv/2008-07-19/macworld-boston-1997-steve-jobs-returns-bill-gates-appeares-on-screen |last1= Dernbach |first1=Christoph |date= 6 August 1997 |website= Mac History |publisher= author |access-date= 17 June 2016--&gt;|title= MacWorld Boston 1997 – Steve Jobs returns – Bill Gates appears on-screen }}

Jobs later gave keynote addresses at trade expositions and conferences at least once a year, in which he announced updates to Apple products or demonstrated new products and services. Nearly every product upgrade or announcement in the next 13 years was made during a Stevenote. Among products so-announced were the original [[iMac]] all-in-one [[desktop computer]] in 1998, the clamshell [[iBook]] in 1999, the [[macOS|Mac OS X]] operating system in 2000, the [[iPod]] music player in 2001, the [[iPhone]] [[smartphone]] in 2007, and the [[iPad]] tablet in 2010.

=={{anchor|The "Stevenote" Address}}Typical Stevenotes==

===1998===
At the 1998 [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC) keynote, Jobs announced that the company was back on track. He reviewed Apple's [[inventory turnover]] rate, describing changes in its distribution system and apple.com, its online store. Jobs said that Apple had sold 500,000 [[Power Macintosh G3]] in its first six months, described the [[PowerBook G3]] and showed the "Steamroller" commercial. He claimed that there were 10 million Apple computers in consumer use and six million educational users, and discussed the [[iMac]] and [[QuickTime]]; Jobs said that the [[International Organization for Standardization]] adopted the QuickTime file format as the basis for [[MPEG 4]]. Jobs said that Apple would add Internet "live" streaming ([[Real-time Transport Protocol]]) to QuickTime 3.0 for its release in fall 1998 and introduced Peter Hoddie, chief architect of QuickTime. Jobs described three improvements Apple wanted to make to [[Java (programming language)|Java]]: unify the [[Java virtual machine]], make it compatible and make it fast. He announced Apple's strategy for [[macOS|Mac OS X]], saying that the 6,000-plus good [[application programming interface]]s (APIs) would be called [[Carbon (API)]], introducing [[Avadis Tevanian]] to demonstrate Carbon. Tevanian introduced Ben Waldman (general manager of the Macintosh unit at [[Microsoft]]), Norm Meyrowitz (president of Macromedia Products) and Greg Gilley (vice-president for graphics applications development at [[Adobe Systems]]), who demonstrated [[Photoshop]]. Jobs announced that the Mac OS 8 Codename Sonata would be released in the third quarter of 1999; [[Rhapsody (operating system)|Rhapsody]] 1.0 would be released in the third quarter of 1998.

===1999===
WWDC 1999 was opened by [[HAL9000]]. Jobs delivered an update, saying that 3,106 Mac apps were announced since May 6, 1998 (the debut date of [[iMac]]); [[Dragon Systems]] was bringing its voice-recognition software to the Mac, and he introduced Janet Baker (co-founder and CEO of Dragon Systems). Jobs updated Apple's profits, units, inventory and cash, announcing that [[Sears]] would be added to its national distribution chain. [[Apple Inc.]] launched its store on Memorial Day 1999, and Jobs announced the [[PowerBook]] line. During the one-week conference, Apple gave away 50 PowerBooks to attending developers. Jobs delivered an update on [[OpenGL]], Java and QuickTime, inviting Avie Tevanian and [[Phil Schiller]] onstage. Schiller demonstrated OpenGL, QuickTime 4, Sherlock 2, the [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]] graphics model, Finder and the MailViewer [[Application software|app]]. Jobs announced Java MRJ 2.1.2, the fastest Mac Java to date, and he and Tevanian demonstrated Java. He reviewed [[Mac OS 8.5]] (released in October 1998), announced [[Mac OS 8.6]], previewed Sonata (scheduled for release in fall 1999) and delivered an update on [[Mac OS X Server 1.0]]. Jobs said that in the [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] [[open-source software]] program there were over 20,000 registered developers and over 175,000 component downloads, describing the three application environments on the Darwin-Quartz foundation. The first was [[Classic Environment]] (formerly named Blue Box); the second was [[Carbon (API)]] (announced at WWDC 1998), and the third was [[Cocoa (API)]] (formerly named Yellow Box). Apple was developing a new [[Finder (software)|Finder]] and a new [[Mail (OS X)|Mail]].

At the August 31, 1999, [[Seybold Seminars]] Expo, Jobs delivered an update on Apple, announcing its June quarterly profits, the appointment of [[Mickey Drexler]] (of [[Gap Inc.]]) to the board of directors, and giving an overview of QuickTime. Apple partnered with [[Akamai Technologies]] as a broadcast network, with content provided by [[BBC News]], [[Bloomberg Television]], [[Fox News]], [[Fox Sports]], [[HBO]], [[NPR]], [[The Weather Channel]], [[WGBH-TV]], [[ABC News]], [[ESPN]], [[Rolling Stone]], [[VH1]], and [[Disney]]; new content was provided by [[Rhino Records]] and [[Warner Bros. Records]]. Phil Schiller demonstrated QuickTime TV, Sherlock 2, VoicePrint, AppleScript and the Power Mac G4, and Jobs previewed [[Mac OS 9]]. He demonstrated nine features: Sherlock 2, a shopping app; Multiple Users, with privacy and preferences for a number of users; VoicePrint Password, voice-recognition software; [[Keychain (software)|Keychain]], with one password; Auto Updating, for the latest updates; Encryption, for private files; File Sharing Over Internet; [[AppleScript]] over TCP/IP, to manage workflow across computers, and Network Browser. Jobs reviewed the [[iMac]], introducing Ozzie Osborne (general manager of speech systems at [[IBM]]) to demonstrate [[ViaVoice]]. Jobs reviewed [[iBook]] (showing two TV advertisements) [[AirPort]] (showing the AirPort Base Station TV ad), the PowerBook and the Power Mac G4, calling  computer scientist [[Richard Crandall]] onstage to demonstrate the G4. Jobs introduced [[John Warnock]], chairman and [[chief commercial officer]] (CCO) of Adobe Systems. Jobs showed a Power Mac G4 TV ad, and introduced the [[Apple Cinema Display]].

On October 5, 1999, Jobs said that [[Akio Morita]] of [[Sony]] had died two days earlier, announced the Mac OS 9 and described the nine internet power tools. Phil Schiller demonstrated Sherlock 2, Multiple Users, VoicePrint Password, Keychain, Encryption, Network Browser and Auto Updating. Jobs reviewed the Power Mac G4, showed a TV ad, and reviewed the Apple Cinema Display, PowerBook, and iBook. He announced the new iMac, and Schiller demonstrated the graphics card. Jobs introduced and demonstrated the iMac DV and iMovie, and showed three TV commercials.

=="One more thing..."==
{{Redirect|One more thing|the song by Zion I|Deep Water Slang V2.0|the album by [[Steve Ashley]]|One More Thing}}
A typical Stevenote began with Jobs presenting sales figures for Apple products and a review of products released during the past few months. He then presented one or more new products. Reminiscent of [[Peter Falk]]'s ''[[Columbo]]'', he typically feigned some concluding remarks, turned as if to leave the stage and turned back, saying "But there's one more thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Haynes|first=Natalie|date=23 January 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/jan/23/natalie-haynes-detectives-columbo|title=Natalie Haynes's guide to TV detectives: #1—Columbo|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=November 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
