'''Concentrated solar power''' ('''CSP''', also known as '''concentrating solar power''', '''concentrated solar thermal''') systems generate [[solar power]] by using mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight onto a receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.solarpaces.org/how-csp-works/|title=How CSP Works: Tower, Trough, Fresnel or Dish|last=|first=|date=June 12, 2018|website=SolarPACES|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electricity]] is generated when the concentrated light is converted to heat ([[solar thermal energy]]), which drives a [[heat engine]] (usually a [[steam turbine]]) connected to an electrical [[power generator]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boerema |first=Nicholas |last2=Morrison |first2=Graham |last3=Taylor |first3=Robert |last4=Rosengarten |first4=Gary |date=1 November 2013 |title=High temperature solar thermal central-receiver billboard design |journal=Solar Energy |volume=97 |pages=356–368 |doi=10.1016/j.solener.2013.09.008|bibcode=2013SoEn...97..356B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Law |first=Edward W. |last2=Prasad |first2=Abhnil A. |last3=Kay |first3=Merlinde |last4=Taylor |first4=Robert A. |date=1 October 2014 |title=Direct normal irradiance forecasting and its application to concentrated solar thermal output forecasting – A review |journal=Solar Energy |volume=108 |pages=287–307 |doi=10.1016/j.solener.2014.07.008|bibcode=2014SoEn..108..287L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Law |first=Edward W. |last2=Kay |first2=Merlinde |last3=Taylor |first3=Robert A. |date=1 February 2016 |title=Calculating the financial value of a concentrated solar thermal plant operated using direct normal irradiance forecasts |journal=Solar Energy |volume=125 |pages=267–281 |doi=10.1016/j.solener.2015.12.031|bibcode=2016SoEn..125..267L }}&lt;/ref&gt; or powers a [[thermochemical]] reaction.&lt;ref name="Sunshine to Petrol"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sunshine to Petrol |url=http://energy.sandia.gov/wp/wp-content/gallery/uploads/S2P_SAND2009-5796P.pdf |publisher=Sandia National Laboratories |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SunShot"&gt;{{cite web |title=Integrated Solar Thermochemical Reaction System |url=https://web.archive.org/liveweb/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/sunshot/csp_sunshotrnd_pnnl.html |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT41013"&gt;{{cite news |title=New Solar Process Gets More Out of Natural Gas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/business/energy-environment/new-solar-process-gets-more-out-of-natural-gas.html |accessdate=11 April 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=10 April 2013 |author=Matthew L.

CSP had a global total installed capacity of 5,500&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]] in 2018, up from 354&amp;nbsp;MW in 2005. [[Solar power in Spain|Spain]] accounted for almost half of the world's capacity, at 2,300&amp;nbsp;MW, despite no new capacity entering commercial operation in the country since 2013.&lt;ref name="HeliosCSP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helioscsp.com/concentrated-solar-power-increasing-cumulative-global-capacity-more-than-11-to-just-under-5-5-gw-in-2018/ |title=Concentrated Solar Power increasing cumulative global capacity more than 11% to just under 5.5 GW in 2018|accessdate=18 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The United States follows with 1,740&amp;nbsp;MW. Interest is also notable in North Africa and the Middle East, as well as [[Solar power in India|India]] and China. 
The global market was initially dominated by parabolic-trough plants, which accounted for 90% of CSP plants at one point.&lt;ref name="saw2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/09/renewables-bounced-back-in-2010-finds-ren21-global-report |title=Renewables Bounced Back in 2010, Finds REN21 Global Report |author=Janet L.

Since about 2010, central power tower CSP has been favored in new plants due to its higher temperature operation (up to 565 C) than trough (up to 400 C), which promises greater efficiency.

Among the [[List of solar thermal power stations|larger CSP projects]] are the [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]] (392&amp;nbsp;MW) in the United States which uses [[solar power tower]] technology without thermal energy storage.
In the MENA region, the [[Ouarzazate Solar Power Station]] came online in Morocco in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Boisgibault, Fahad Al Kabbani (2020): [http://www.iste.co.uk/book.php?id=1591 ''Energy Transition in Metropolises, Rural Areas and Deserts'']. [[Wiley - ISTE]]. (Energy series) {{ISBN|9781786304995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It combines trough and tower in three sections for a total of 510 MW with several hours of energy storage.
Morocco began its second large CSP project at Midelt as of mid 2019, at 800 MW, with 5 hours of thermal energy storage daily, and combining trough CSP and PV It was bid in mid-2019 at just $70/MWh&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.solarpaces.org/morocco-breaks-new-record-with-800-mw-midelt-1-csp-pv-at-7-cents/|title=Morocco Breaks New Record with 800 MW Midelt 1 CSP-PV at 7 Cents|last=Kraemer|first=Susan|date=May 24, 2019|website=SolarPACES|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; the lowest price CSP to date.

The DEWA project in Dubai, under construction in 2019, held the world record for lowest CSP price in 2017 at $73 per MWh&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://analysis.newenergyupdate.com/csp-today/acwa-power-scales-tower-trough-design-set-record-low-csp-price|title=ACWA Power scales up tower-trough design to set record-low CSP price|last=Reuters|date=September 20, 2017|website=New Energy Update / CSP Today|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its 700 MW combined trough and tower project; 600 MW of trough, 100 MW of tower with 15 hours of thermal energy storage daily.

Because they both utilize the sun's energy, CSP is often compared to [[Growth of photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] solar (PV), which experienced huge growth in recent years due to falling prices for panel manufacturing and modular growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helioscsp.com/as-concentrated-solar-power-bids-fall-to-record-lows-prices-seen-diverging-between-different-regions/ |title=As Concentrated Solar Power bids fall to record lows, prices seen diverging between different regions|accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcet.org/news/redefine/rewire/solar/concentrating-solar/are-solar-power-towers-doomed-in-california.html |title=Are Solar Power Towers Doomed in California? |author=Chris Clarke |work=KCET}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the capacity of CSP to store energy during the night means in can compete against gas for peak generation in the evening, rather than competing against PV in the daytime&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarpaces.org/csp-competes-with-natural-gas-not-pv/|title=CSP Doesn't Compete With PV – it Competes with Gas|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a thermal energy generating power station, CSP has more in common with thermal power stations such as coal or gas or geothermal. A CSP plant can incorporate [[thermal energy storage]], which stores energy either in the form of sensible heat, or as latent heat (for example, using [[molten salt]]), which enables these plants to continue to generate electricity whenever it is needed, day or night. This makes CSP a [[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable]] form of solar. Dispatchable renewable energy is particularly valuable in places where there is already a high penetration of photovoltaics (PV), such as [[solar power in California|California]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarpaces.org/chance-csp-california-outlaws-gas-fired-peaker-plants/ |title=New Chance for US CSP? California Outlaws Gas-Fired Peaker Plants|accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; because an evening peak is created as PV ramps down at sunset (a phenomenon referred to as [[duck curve]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Deign |first1=Jason |title=Concentrated Solar Power Quietly Makes a Comeback |url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/concentrated-solar-power-quietly-makes-a-comeback |website=www.greentechmedia.com |date=24 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, CSP represented less than 2% of worldwide installed capacity of solar electricity plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2017/09/concentrating-solar-power.html |title=After the Desertec hype: is concentrating solar power still alive?|accessdate= 24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent years the falling prices of CSP plants are making this technology competitive with other base-load power plants using fossil and nuclear fuel even in high moisture and dusty atmosphere at sea level, such as the [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2019/06/04/concentrated-solar-power-costs-fell-46-from-2010-2018/ |title=Concentrated Solar Power Costs Fell 46% From 2010–2018|accessdate=3 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dub"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helioscsp.com/uaes-push-on-concentrated-solar-power-should-open-eyes-across-world/ |title=UAE's push on concentrated solar power should open eyes across world|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helioscsp.com/concentrated-solar-power-dropped-50-in-six-months/ |title=Concentrated Solar Power Dropped 50% in Six Months|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Base-load CSP tariff in the extremely dry [[Atacama region]] of [[Chile]] reached below ¢5.0/kWh in 2017 auctions.&lt;ref name="chile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarpaces.org/solarreserve-bids-csp-5-cents-chilean-auction/ |title=SolarReserve Bids CSP Under 5 Cents in Chilean Auction|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kraemer /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:1901 solar motor.jpg|thumb|Solar steam engine for water pumping, near Los Angeles circa 1901]]
A legend has it that [[Archimedes]] used a "burning glass" to concentrate sunlight on the invading Roman fleet and repel them from [[Syracuse, Sicily#Greek period|Syracuse]]. In 1973 a Greek scientist, Dr. Ioannis Sakkas, curious about whether Archimedes could really have destroyed the Roman fleet in 212 BC, lined up nearly 60 Greek sailors, each holding an oblong mirror tipped to catch the sun's rays and direct them at a tar-covered plywood silhouette {{convert|160|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} away. The ship caught fire after a few minutes; however, historians continue to doubt the Archimedes story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomas W. Africa |jstor=4348211 |title=Archimedes through the Looking Glass |date=1975 |journal=The Classical World |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=305–308 |doi=10.2307/4348211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, [[Auguste Mouchout]] used a parabolic trough to producе steam for the first solar steam engine. The first patent for a solar collector was obtained by the Italian Alessandro Battaglia in Genoa, Italy, in 1886. Over the following years, invеntors such as [[John Ericsson]] and [[Frank Shuman]] developed concentrating solar-powered dеvices for irrigation, refrigеration, and locomоtion. In 1913 Shuman finished a {{convert|55|hp|kW}} parabolic [[solar thermal energy]] station in Maadi, Egypt for irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Butti, John Perlin (1980) ''A Golden Thread: 2500 Years of Solar Architecture and Technology'', Cheshire Books, pp. 66–100, {{ISBN|0442240058}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=CM|last=Meyer|url=http://eepublishers.co.za/article/from-troughs-to-triumph-segs-and-gas.html|title=From troughs to triumph: SEGS and gas|website=Eepublishers.co.za|access-date=22 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807122351/http://eepublishers.co.za/article/from-troughs-to-triumph-segs-and-gas.html|archive-date=7 August 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cutler J.

Cabinet Magazine, Issue 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The first solar-power system using a mirror dish was built by [[Robert H. Goddard|Dr. R.H. Goddard]], who was already well known for his research on liquid-fueled rockets and wrote an article in 1929 in which he asserted that all the previous obstacles had been addressed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FSgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22 "A New Invention To Harness The Sun"] ''Popular Science'', November 1929&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Giovanni Francia (1911–1980) designed and built the first concentrated-solar plant, which entered into operation in Sant'Ilario, near Genoa, Italy in 1968. This plant had the architecture of today's power tower plants with a solar receiver in the center of a field of solar collectors. The plant was able to produce 1&amp;nbsp;MW with superheated steam at 100 bar and 500&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Butti, John Perlin (1980) ''A Golden Thread: 2500 Years of Solar Architecture and Technology'', Cheshire Books, p. 68, {{ISBN|0442240058}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 10&amp;nbsp;MW [[The Solar Project|Solar One]] power tower was developed in Southern California in 1981. [[The Solar Project#Solar One|Solar One]] was converted into [[The Solar Project#Solar Two|Solar Two]] in 1995, implementing a new design with a molten salt mixture (60% sodium nitrate, 40% potassium nitrate) as the receiver working fluid and as a storage medium. The molten salt approach proved effective, and Solar Two operated successfully until it was decommissioned in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2015/ph240/dodaro2/|title=Molten Salt Storage|website=large.stanford.edu|access-date=2019-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parabolic-trough technology of the nearby [[Solar Energy Generating Systems]] (SEGS), begun in 1984, was more workable. The 354&amp;nbsp;MW SEGS was the largest solar power plant in the world, until 2014.

No commercial concentrated solar was constructed from 1990 when SEGS was completed until 2006 when the [[Compact linear Fresnel reflector]] system at Liddell Power Station in Australia was built. Few other plants were built with this design although the 5&amp;nbsp;MW [[Kimberlina Solar Thermal Energy Plant]] opened in 2009.

In 2007, 75&amp;nbsp;MW Nevada Solar One was built, a trough design and the first large plant since SEGS. Between 2009 and 2013, Spain built over 40 parabolic trough systems, standardized in 50&amp;nbsp;MW blocks.

Due to the success of Solar Two, a commercial power plant, called [[Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant|Solar Tres Power Tower]], was built in Spain in 2011, later renamed Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant. Gemasolar's results paved the way for further plants of its type. [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]] was constructed at the same time but without thermal storage, using natural gas to preheat water each morning.

Most concentrated solar power plants use the parabolic trough design, instead of the power tower or Fresnel systems. There have also been variations of parabolic trough systems like the [[Combined cycle#Integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC)|integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC)]] which combines troughs and conventional fossil fuel heat systems.

CSP was originally treated as a competitor to photovoltaics, and Ivanpah was built without energy storage, although Solar Two had included several hours of thermal storage. By 2015, prices for photovoltaic plants had fallen and PV commercial power was selling for {{frac|1|3}} of recent CSP contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2015/12/15/nrg-ivanpah-faces-chance-of-default-PGE-contract|title=Ivanpah Solar Project Faces Risk of Default on PG&amp;E Contracts|work=KQED News|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325144752/http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2015/12/15/nrg-ivanpah-faces-chance-of-default-PGE-contract|archivedate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://guntherportfolio.com/2013/04/esolar-sierra-suntower-a-history-of-concentrating-solar-power-underperformance/ |title=eSolar Sierra SunTower: a History of Concentrating Solar Power Underperformance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, increasingly, CSP was being bid with 3 to 12 hours of thermal energy storage, making CSP a dispatchable form of solar energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/why-concentrating-solar-power-needs-storage-to-survive#gs.zD6uAiA|title=Why Concentrating Solar Power Needs Storage to Survive|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is increasingly seen as competing with natural gas and PV with batteries for flexible, dispatchable power.

== Current technology ==
CSP is used to produce electricity (sometimes called solar thermoelectricity, usually generated through [[steam]]). Concentrated-solar technology systems use [[mirror]]s or [[lens (optics)|lens]]es with [[Optical motion tracking|tracking]] systems to focus a large area of sunlight onto a small area. The concentrated light is then used as heat or as a heat source for a conventional [[power plant]] (solar thermoelectricity). The solar concentrators used in CSP systems can often also be used to provide industrial process heating or cooling, such as in [[solar air conditioning]].

Concentrating technologies exist in four optical types, namely [[parabolic trough]], [[dish Stirling|dish]], [[Compact Linear Fresnel Reflector|concentrating linear Fresnel reflector]], and [[solar power tower]].&lt;ref name=tomkonrad&gt;[http://tomkonrad.wordpress.com/2006/12/07/they-do-it-with-mirrors-concentrating-solar-power/ Types of solar thermal CSP plants]. Tomkonrad.wordpress.com. Retrieved on 22 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Parabolic trough and concentrating linear Fresnel reflectors are classified as linear focus collector types. Dish and solar tower as of the point focus type. Linear focus collectors achieve medium concentration (50 suns and over), and point focus collectors achieve high concentration (over 500 suns) factors. Although simple, these solar concentrators are quite far from the theoretical maximum concentration.&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"&gt;{{cite book |first=Julio |last=Chaves |title=Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |year=2015 |isbn=978-1482206739}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NIO"&gt;Roland Winston, Juan C. Miñano, Pablo G. Benitez (2004) ''Nonimaging Optics'', Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-0127597515}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the parabolic-trough concentration gives about {{frac|1|3}} of the theoretical maximum for the design [[Acceptance angle (solar concentrator)|acceptance angle]], that is, for the same overall tolerances for the system. Approaching the theoretical maximum may be achieved by using more elaborate concentrators based on [[nonimaging optics]].&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NIO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Norton |first=Brian |title=Harnessing Solar Heat |date=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-007-7275-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different types of concentrators produce different peak temperatures and correspondingly varying thermodynamic efficiencies, due to differences in the way that they track the sun and focus light. New innovations in CSP technology are leading systems to become more and more cost-effective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/4288743.html?page=1 New innovations in solar thermal].

{{Main|Parabolic trough}}

A parabolic trough consists of a linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's focal line. The receiver is a tube positioned directly above the middle of the parabolic mirror and filled with a working fluid. The reflector follows the sun during the daylight hours by tracking along a single axis. A [[working fluid]] (e.g. [[molten salt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vignarooban |first=K. |last2=Xinhai |first2=Xu |year=2015 |title=Heat transfer fluids for concentrating solar power systems – A review |journal=Applied Energy |volume= 146|pages= 383–396|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.01.125}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is heated to {{convert|150|–|350|C|F}} as it flows through the receiver and is then used as a heat source for a power generation system.&lt;ref name="Martin 2005"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Christopher L. Martin |author2=D.

The [[Solar Energy Generating Systems]] (SEGS) plants in California, the world's first commercial parabolic trough plants, Acciona's [[Nevada Solar One]] near [[Boulder City, Nevada]], and [[Andasol]], Europe's first commercial parabolic trough plant are representative, along with [[Plataforma Solar de Almería]]'s SSPS-DCS test facilities in [[Solar power in Spain|Spain]].&lt;ref name="Plataforma"&gt;{{cite web |title=Linear-focusing Concentrator Facilities: DCS, DISS, EUROTROUGH and LS3 |publisher=Plataforma Solar de Almería |url=http://www.psa.es/webeng/instalaciones/parabolicos.html |accessdate=29 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928042703/http://www.psa.es/webeng/instalaciones/parabolicos.html |archivedate=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Enclosed trough ====
The design encapsulates the solar thermal system within a greenhouse-like glasshouse. The glasshouse creates a protected environment to withstand the elements that can negatively impact reliability and efficiency of the solar thermal system.&lt;ref name="deloitte"&gt;Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd, [http://www.deloitte.com/energypredictions2012 "Energy &amp; Resources Predictions 2012"], 2 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Lightweight curved solar-reflecting mirrors are suspended from the ceiling of the glasshouse by wires. A [[Solar tracker|single-axis tracking system]] positions the mirrors to retrieve the optimal amount of sunlight. The mirrors concentrate the sunlight and focus it on a network of stationary steel pipes, also suspended from the glasshouse structure.&lt;ref&gt;Helman, [https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0425/features-glasspoint-greenhouses-green-energy-oil-from-sun.html "Oil from the sun"], "Forbes", 25 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Water is carried throughout the length of the pipe, which is boiled to generate steam when intense solar radiation is applied. Sheltering the mirrors from the wind allows them to achieve higher temperature rates and prevents dust from building up on the mirrors.&lt;ref name="deloitte"/&gt;

[[GlassPoint Solar]], the company that created the Enclosed Trough design, states its technology can produce heat for [[Enhanced Oil Recovery]] (EOR) for about $5 per {{convert|1000000|BTU|kWh|abbr=on|order=flip}} in sunny regions, compared to between $10 and $12 for other conventional solar thermal technologies.&lt;ref name="ehren chevron"&gt;Goossens, Ehren, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-03/chevron-using-solar-thermal-steam-at-enhanced-oil-recovery-plant.html "Chevron Uses Solar-Thermal Steam to Extract Oil in California"], "Bloomberg", 3 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar power tower ===
{{Main|Solar power tower}}
[[File:Brigthsource Tower Ashalim.jpg|thumb|[[Ashalim Power Station]], Israel, on its completion the tallest solar tower in the world. It concentrates light from over 50,000 heliostats.]] 
[[File:PS10 solar power tower.jpg|thumb|The [[PS10 solar power plant]] in [[Andalusia]], Spain, concentrates sunlight from a field of [[heliostat]]s onto a central [[#Solar power tower|solar power tower]].]]
A solar power tower consists of an array of dual-axis tracking reflectors ([[heliostat]]s) that concentrate sunlight on a central receiver atop a tower; the receiver contains a heat-transfer fluid, which can consist of water-steam or [[molten salt]]. Optically a solar power tower is the same as a circular Fresnel reflector. The working fluid in the receiver is heated to 500–1000&amp;nbsp;°C ({{convert|773|-|1273|K|F|disp=or}}) and then used as a heat source for a power generation or energy storage system.&lt;ref name="Martin 2005"/&gt; An advantage of the solar tower is the reflectors can be adjusted instead of the whole tower. Power-tower development is less advanced than trough systems, but they offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capability. Beam down tower application is also feasible with heliostats to heat the working fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://helioscsp.com/three-solar-modules-of-worlds-first-commercial-beam-down-tower-concentrated-solar-power-project-to-be-connected-to-grid/ |title=Three solar modules of world's first commercial beam-down tower Concentrated Solar Power project to be connected to grid |accessdate=18 August 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Solar Two]] in [[Daggett, California|Daggett]], California and the CESA-1 in [[Plataforma Solar de Almeria]] Almeria, Spain, are the most representative demonstration plants. The [[PS10 solar power tower|Planta Solar 10]] (PS10) in [[Sanlucar la Mayor]], Spain, is the first commercial utility-scale solar power tower in the world. The 377&amp;nbsp;MW [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]], located in the [[Mojave Desert]], is the largest CSP facility in the world, and uses three power towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brightsourceenergy.com/ivanpah-solar-project|title=Ivanpah - World's Largest Solar Plant in California Desert|website=www.brightsourceenergy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivanpah generated only 0.652&amp;nbsp;TWh (63%) of its energy from solar means, and the other 0.388&amp;nbsp;TWh (37%) was generated by burning [[natural gas]].

=== Fresnel reflectors ===
{{Main|Compact Linear Fresnel Reflector}}
Fresnel reflectors are made of many thin, flat mirror strips to concentrate sunlight onto tubes through which working fluid is pumped. Flat mirrors allow more reflective surface in the same amount of space than a parabolic reflector, thus capturing more of the available sunlight, and they are much cheaper than parabolic reflectors. Fresnel reflectors can be used in various size CSPs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/app/research/solar/clfr.html Compact CLFR]. Physics.usyd.edu.au (12 June 2002). Retrieved on 22 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721150750/http://www.ese.iitb.ac.in/activities/solarpower/ausra.pdf Ausra's Compact Linear Fresnel Reflector (CLFR) and Lower Temperature Approach]. ese.iitb.ac.in&lt;/ref&gt;

Fresnel reflectors are sometimes regarded as a technology with a worse output than other methods. The cost efficiency of this model is what causes some to use this instead of others with higher output ratings. Some new models of Fresnel Reflectors with Ray Tracing capabilities have begun to be tested and have initially proved to yield higher output than the standard version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abbas |first1=R. |last2=Muñoz-Antón |first2=J. |last3=Valdés |first3=M. |last4=Martínez-Val |first4=J.M. |title=High concentration linear Fresnel reflectors |journal=Energy Conversion and Management |date=August 2013 |volume=72 |pages=60–68 |doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2013.01.039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dish Stirling ===
[[File:SolarStirlingEngine.jpg|thumb|[[Solar thermal energy#Dish designs|A dish Stirling]] ]]
{{Main|Dish Stirling}}

A dish Stirling or dish engine system consists of a stand-alone [[parabolic reflector]] that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned at the reflector's focal point. The reflector tracks the Sun along two axes. The working fluid in the receiver is heated to {{convert|250|–|700|C|F}} and then used by a [[Stirling engine]] to generate power.&lt;ref name="Martin 2005"/&gt; Parabolic-dish systems provide high solar-to-electric efficiency (between 31% and 32%), and their modular nature provides scalability. The [[Stirling Energy Systems]] (SES), [[United Sun Systems International|United Sun Systems]] (USS) and [[Science Applications International Corporation|Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC)]] dishes at [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas|UNLV]], and [[Australian National University]]'s [[The Big Dish (solar thermal)|Big Dish]] in [[Canberra]], Australia are representative of this technology. A world record for solar to electric efficiency was set at 31.25% by SES dishes at the [[National Solar Thermal Test Facility]] (NSTTF) in New Mexico on 31 January 2008, a cold, bright day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2008/solargrid.html Sandia, Stirling Energy Systems set new world record for solar-to-grid conversion efficiency.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219193847/https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/releases/2008/solargrid.html |date=19 February 2013 }} Share.sandia.gov (12 February 2008). Retrieved on 22 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; According to its developer, [[Ripasso Energy]], a Swedish firm, in 2015 its Dish Sterling system being tested in the [[Kalahari Desert]] in South Africa showed 34% efficiency.&lt;ref name="Guardian51315"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Jeffrey Barbee |title=Could this be the world's most efficient solar electricity system? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/13/could-this-be-the-worlds-most-efficient-solar-electricity-system |accessdate=21 April 2017 |work=The Guardian |date=13 May 2015 |quote=34% of the sun’s energy hitting the mirrors is converted directly to grid-available electric power}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SES installation in Maricopa, Phoenix was the largest Stirling Dish power installation in the world until it was sold to [[United Sun Systems International|United Sun Systems]]. Subsequently, larger parts of the installation have been moved to China as part of the huge energy demand.

== Solar thermal enhanced oil recovery ==
{{Main|Solar thermal enhanced oil recovery}}

Heat from the sun can be used to provide steam used to make heavy oil less viscous and easier to pump. Solar power tower and parabolic troughs can be used to provide the steam which is used directly so no generators are required and no electricity is produced. Solar thermal enhanced oil recovery can extend the life of oilfields with very thick oil which would not otherwise be economical to pump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helioscsp.com/csp-eor-developer-cuts-costs-on-1-gw-oman-concentrated-solar-power-project/ |title=CSP EOR developer cuts costs on 1&amp;nbsp;GW Oman Concentrated Solar Power project|accessdate= 24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CSP with thermal energy storage ==
{{See also|Thermal energy storage|Solar thermal energy}}
In a CSP plant that includes storage, the solar energy is first used to heat the molten salt or synthetic oil which is stored providing thermal/heat energy at high temperature in insulated tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.solarpaces.org/how-csp-thermal-energy-storage-works/|title=How CSP's Thermal Energy Storage Works - SolarPACES|date=10 September 2017|work=SolarPACES|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarreserve.com/en/technology/molten-salt-energy-storage|title=Molten salt energy storage |accessdate= 22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the hot molten salt (or oil) is used in a steam generator to produce steam to generate electricity by steam [[turbo generator]] as per requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powermag.com/the-latest-in-thermal-energy-storage/|title=The Latest in Thermal Energy Storage |accessdate= 22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus solar energy which is available in daylight only is used to generate electricity round the clock on demand as a [[load following power plant]] or solar peaker plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/is-csp-viable-without-storage#gs.9UN2YLg|title=Concentrating Solar Power Isn't Viable Without Storage, Say Experts |accessdate= 29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarpaces.org/study-solar-peaker-compete-with-gas/|title=How Solar Peaker Plants Could Replace Gas Peakers |accessdate= 2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thermal storage capacity is indicated in hours of power generation at [[nameplate capacity]]. Unlike [[photovoltaics|solar PV]] or CSP without storage, the power generation from solar thermal storage plants is [[ancillary services (electric power)|dispatchable and self-sustainable]] similar to coal/gas-fired power plants, but without the pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reneweconomy.com.au/aurora-what-you-should-know-about-port-augustas-solar-power-tower-86715/|title=Aurora: What you should know about Port Augusta's solar power-tower |accessdate= 22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CSP with thermal energy storage plants can also be used as [[cogeneration]] plants to supply both electricity and process steam round the clock. As of December 2018, CSP with thermal energy storage plants generation cost have ranged between 5 c&amp;nbsp;€&amp;nbsp;/ kWh and 7 c&amp;nbsp;€&amp;nbsp;/ kWh depending on good to medium solar radiation received at a location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helioscsp.com/2018-the-year-in-which-the-concentrated-solar-power-returned-to-shine/|title=2018, the year in which the Concentrated Solar Power returned to shine |accessdate= 18 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike solar PV plants, CSP with thermal energy storage plants can also be used economically round the clock to produce only process steam replacing pollution emitting [[fossil fuels]]. CSP plant can also be integrated with solar PV for better synergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10081/151_read-34003/#/gallery/28711|title=Controllable solar power – competitively priced for the first time in North Africa |accessdate= 7 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.solarpaces.org/morocco-breaks-new-record-with-800-mw-midelt-1-csp-pv-at-7-cents/|title=Morocco Breaks New Record with 800 MW Midelt 1 CSP-PV at 7 Cents |accessdate= 7 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.solarpaces.org/morocco-pioneers-pv-with-thermal-storage-at-800-mw-midelt-csp-project/|title=Morocco Pioneers PV with Thermal Storage at 800 MW Midelt CSP Project |accessdate= 25 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commercial deployment of CSP plants started by 1984 in the US with the [[Solar Energy Generating Systems|SEGS]] plants. The last SEGS plant was completed in 1990. From 1991 to 2005, no CSP plants were built anywhere in the world. Global installed CSP-capacity increased nearly tenfold between 2004 and 2013 and grew at an average of 50 percent per year during the last five of those years.&lt;ref name="ren21-gsr-2014" /&gt;{{rp|51}} In 2013, worldwide installed capacity increased by 36% or nearly 0.9 [[gigawatt]] (GW) to more than 3.4&amp;nbsp;GW. [[Solar power in Spain|Spain]] and the [[Solar power in the United States|United States]] remained the global leaders, while the number of countries with installed CSP were growing but the rapid decrease in price of PV solar, policy changes and the global financial crisis stopped most development in these countries. 2014 was the best year for CSP but was followed by a rapid decline with only one major plant completed in the world in 2016. There is a notable trend towards developing countries and regions with high solar radiation with several large plants under construction in 2017.

CSP is also increasingly competing with the cheaper [[photovoltaic]] solar power and with [[concentrator photovoltaics]] (CPV), a fast-growing technology that just like CSP is suited best for regions of high solar insolation.&lt;ref&gt;PV-insider.com [http://news.pv-insider.com/concentrated-pv/how-cpv-trumps-csp-high-dni-locations How CPV trumps CSP in high DNI locations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141122062102/http://news.pv-insider.com/concentrated-pv/how-cpv-trumps-csp-high-dni-locations |date=22 November 2014 }}, 14 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleantechinvestor.com/portal/solarpowercomment/10440-cpv-an-oasis-in-the-csp-desert.html |title=CPV - an oasis in the CSP desert? |author=Margaret Schleifer |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518092811/http://www.cleantechinvestor.com/portal/solarpowercomment/10440-cpv-an-oasis-in-the-csp-desert.html |archivedate=18 May 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a novel solar CPV/CSP hybrid system has been proposed recently.&lt;ref&gt;Phys.org [http://phys.org/news/2015-02-solar-cpvcsp-hybrid.html A novel solar CPV/CSP hybrid system proposed], 11 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efficiency ==

The efficiency of a concentrating solar power system will depend on the technology used to convert the solar power to electrical energy, the operating temperature of the receiver and the heat rejection, thermal losses in the system, and the presence or absence of other system losses; in addition to the conversion efficiency, the optical system which concentrates the sunlight will also add additional losses.

Real-world systems claim a maximum conversion efficiency of 23-35% for "power tower" type systems, operating at temperatures from 250-565&amp;nbsp;°C, with the higher efficiency number assuming a combined cycle turbine. Dish Stirling systems, operating at temperatures of 550-750&amp;nbsp;°C, claim an efficiency of about 30%.&lt;ref name=IRENA2012&gt;International Renewable Energy Agency, "Table 2.1: Comparison of different CSP Technologies", in [https://www.irena.org/documentdownloads/publications/re_technologies_cost_analysis-csp.pdf Concentrating Solar Power, Volume 1: Power Sector], RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES: COST ANALYSIS SERIES, June 2012, p. 10. Retrieved 23 May 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to variation in sun incidence during the day, the average conversion efficiency achieved is not equal to these maximum efficiencies, and the net annual solar-to- electricity efficiencies are 7-20% for pilot power tower systems, and 12-25% for demonstration-scale Stirling dish systems.&lt;ref name=IRENA2012 /&gt;

===Theory===
The maximum conversion efficiency of any thermal to electrical energy system is given by the [[Carnot efficiency]], which represents a theoretical limit to the efficiency that can be achieved by any system, set by the [[laws of thermodynamics]]. Real-world systems do not achieve the Carnot efficiency.

The conversion efficiency &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; of the incident solar radiation into mechanical work depends on the [[thermal radiation]] properties of the solar receiver and on the heat engine (''e.g.'' steam turbine). 
[[Solar irradiation]] is first converted into heat by the solar receiver with the efficiency &lt;math&gt;\eta_{Receiver}&lt;/math&gt; and subsequently the heat is converted into mechanical energy by the heat engine with the efficiency &lt;math&gt;\eta_{mechanical}&lt;/math&gt;, using [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=E. A. Fletcher |date= 2001 |title= Solar thermal processing: A review |doi=10.1115/1.1349552 |journal=Journal of Solar Energy Engineering |volume=123 |issue=2 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aldo Steinfeld |author2=Robert Palumbo |last-author-amp=yes |date=2001 |title=Solar Thermochemical Process Technology |journal=Encyclopedia of Physical Science &amp; Technology, R.A. Meyers Ed. |publisher=Academic Press |volume=15 |pages=237–256 |url=http://pre.ethz.ch/publications/0_pdf/books/Solar_Thermochemical_Process_Technology.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719132827/http://www.pre.ethz.ch/publications/0_pdf/books/Solar_Thermochemical_Process_Technology.pdf |archivedate=19 July 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanical energy is then converted into electrical energy by a generator.
For a solar receiver with a mechanical converter (''e.g''., a turbine), the overall conversion efficiency can be defined as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \eta_\mathrm{optics}\cdot\eta_\mathrm{receiver} \cdot \eta_\mathrm{mechanical}  \cdot \eta_\mathrm{generator} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\eta_\mathrm{optics} &lt;/math&gt; represents the fraction of incident light concentrated onto the receiver, &lt;math&gt;\eta_\mathrm{receiver}&lt;/math&gt; the fraction of light incident on the receiver that is converted into heat energy, &lt;math&gt;\eta_\mathrm{mechanical} &lt;/math&gt; the efficiency of conversion of heat energy into mechanical energy, and &lt;math&gt;\eta_\mathrm{generator} &lt;/math&gt; the efficiency of converting the mechanical energy into electrical power.

&lt;math&gt;\eta_\mathrm{receiver}&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_\mathrm{receiver} = \frac{Q_\mathrm{absorbed}-Q_\mathrm{lost}}{Q_\mathrm{incident}}&lt;/math&gt;
::with &lt;math&gt;Q_\mathrm{incident}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q_\mathrm{absorbed}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q_\mathrm{lost}&lt;/math&gt; respectively the incoming [[solar flux]] and the fluxes absorbed and lost by the system solar receiver.

The conversion efficiency &lt;math&gt;\eta_\mathrm{mechanical} &lt;/math&gt; is at most the Carnot efficiency, which is determined by the temperature of the receiver &lt;math&gt;T_H&lt;/math&gt; and the temperature of the heat rejection ("heat sink temperature") &lt;math&gt;T^0&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;\eta_\mathrm{Carnot} = 1 - \frac{T^0}{T_H} &lt;/math&gt;

The real-world efficiencies of typical engines achieve 50% to at most 70% of the Carnot efficiency due to losses such as heat loss and windage in the moving parts.

===Ideal case===

For a solar flux &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; (e.g. &lt;math&gt;I = 1000\, \mathrm{W/m^2}&lt;/math&gt;) concentrated &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; times with an efficiency &lt;math&gt;\eta_{Optics}&lt;/math&gt; on the system solar receiver with a collecting area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and an [[Absorbance|absorptivity]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;Q_\mathrm{solar} = I C A &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;Q_\mathrm{absorbed} = \eta_\mathrm{optics} \alpha Q_\mathrm{solar} &lt;/math&gt;,
For simplicity's sake, one can assume that the losses are only radiative ones (a fair assumption for high temperatures), thus for a reradiating area ''A'' and an [[emissivity]] &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; applying the [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]] yields:
:&lt;math&gt;Q_\mathrm{lost} = A \epsilon \sigma T_H^4 &lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying these equations by considering perfect optics (&lt;math&gt;\eta_\mathrm{Optics}&lt;/math&gt; = 1) and without considering the ultimate conversion step into electricity by a generator, collecting and reradiating areas equal and maximum absorptivity and emissivity (&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; = 1, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; = 1) then substituting in the first equation gives
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \left(1 - \frac {\sigma T_H^4 }{IC} \right) \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{T^0}{T_H} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Solar concentration efficiency.png|400px]]

The graph shows that the overall efficiency does not increase steadily with the receiver's temperature. Although the heat engine's efficiency (Carnot) increases with higher temperature, the receiver's efficiency does not. On the contrary, the receiver's efficiency is decreasing, as the amount of energy it cannot absorb (Q&lt;sub&gt;lost&lt;/sub&gt;) grows by the fourth power as a function of temperature. Hence, there is a maximum reachable temperature. When the receiver efficiency is null (blue curve on the figure below), T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is:
&lt;math&gt; T_\mathrm{max} = \left({\frac {IC}{\sigma}} \right)^{0.25} &lt;/math&gt;

There is a temperature T&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt; for which the efficiency is maximum, ''i.e''. when the efficiency derivative relative to the receiver temperature is null:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\eta}{dT_H}(T_\mathrm{opt}) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
Consequently, this leads us to the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt;T_{opt}^5-(0.75T^0)T_\mathrm{opt}^4-\frac{T^0IC}{4\sigma} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
Solving this equation numerically allows us to obtain the optimum process temperature according to the solar concentration ratio &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; (red curve on the figure below)

Theoretical efficiencies aside, real-world experience of CSP reveals a 25%–60% shortfall in projected production, a good part of which is due to the practical Carnot cycle losses not included in the above analysis.

== Costs ==
As of 2017, new CSP power plants are economically competitive with fossil fuels in certain regions, such as Chile, Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.solarpaces.org/port-augusta-cheapest-solar-thermal-power/|title=How Port Augusta Got the World's Cheapest Solar Thermal Power - SolarPACES|date=30 August 2017|work=SolarPACES|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Middle east and North Africa Region (MENA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cmimarseille.org/menacspkip/recording-live-cast-paddy-padmanathan-speaking-live-dewa-700mw-csp-project/|title=Recording of Live Cast: Paddy Padmanathan speaking live about the DEWA 700&amp;nbsp;MW CSP project - MENA CSP KIP|work=MENA CSP KIP|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathaniel Bullard, a solar analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, calculated that the cost of electricity at the [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]], a project contracted in 2009 and completed in 2014 in Southern California, would be lower than that from photovoltaic power and about the same as that from natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robert Glennon |author2=Andrew M.

[[International Renewable Energy Agency|IRENA]] has published in June 2012 a series of studies titled: "Renewable Energy Cost Analysis". The CSP study shows the cost of both building and operation of CSP plants. Costs are expected to decrease, but there are insufficient installations to clearly establish the learning curve.

By 2012, there was 1.9&amp;nbsp;GW of CSP installed, with 1.8&amp;nbsp;GW of that being parabolic trough.&lt;ref name="IRENA"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120613192252/http://www.irena.org/menu/index.aspx?mnu=cat&amp;PriMenuID=36&amp;CatID=128 Renewable Energy Cost Analysis – Concentrating Solar Power]. irena.org&lt;/ref&gt; The US Department of Energy publishes the up to date list of [http://www.solarpaces.org/csp-technologies/csp-projects-around-the-world/ CSP power plants] at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) under a contract from [[SolarPACES]], the international network of CSP researchers and industry experts. As of 2017, there is 5&amp;nbsp;GW of CSP installed globally, with most of that in Spain at 2.3&amp;nbsp;GW, and the US at 1.3&amp;nbsp;GW.

At the 2016 Chile auction, SolarReserve bid $63/MWh ([[Penny (United States coin)|¢]]6.3/kWh) for 24-hour CSP power with no subsidies, competing with other types such as LNG gas turbines.&lt;ref name="Kraemer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2017/03/13/solarreserve-bids-24-hour-solar-6-3-cents-chile/|title=SolarReserve Bids 24-Hour Solar At 6.3 Cents In Chile|last=|first=|date=13 March 2017|website=|publisher=CleanTechnica|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incentives ==

=== Spain ===
Until 2012, solar-thermal electricity generation was initially eligible for feed-in tariff payments (art. 2 RD 661/2007), if the system capacity does not exceed the following limits:
* Systems registered in the register of systems prior to 29 September 2008: 500&amp;nbsp;MW for solar-thermal systems.
* Systems registered after 29 September 2008 (PV only).
The capacity limits for the different system types are re-defined during the review of the application conditions every quarter (art. 5 RD 1578/2008, Annex III RD 1578/2008). Prior to the end of an application period, the market caps specified for each system type are published on the website of the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade (art. 5 RD 1578/2008).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120427001457/http://res-legal.de/en/search%2Dfor%2Dcountries/spain/single/land/spanien/instrument/price%2Dregulation%2Dregimen%2Despecial/ueberblick/foerderung.html?bmu%5BlastPid%5D%3D97%26bmu%5BlastShow%5D%3D1%26cHash%3D0eefe5ac972c28a4b783b540f3d49b3d#91%3BlastPid%26 Feed-in tariff (Régimen Especial)]. res-legal.de (12 December 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
{{See also|Energy policy of Australia}}
At the federal level, under the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET), in operation under the Renewable Energy Electricity Act 2000, large scale solar thermal electricity generation from accredited RET power stations may be entitled to create large-scale generation certificates (LGCs). These certificates can then be sold and transferred to liable entities (usually electricity retailers) to meet their obligations under this tradeable certificates scheme. However, as this legislation is technology neutral in its operation, it tends to favour more established RE technologies with a lower levelised cost of generation, such as large scale onshore wind, rather than solar thermal and CSP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1408345 A Dangerous Obsession with Least Cost?

Daya-Winterbottom (eds.) Lawbook Company, {{ISBN|0455226342}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At State level, renewable energy feed-in laws typically are capped by maximum generation capacity in kWp, and are open only to micro or medium scale generation and in a number of instances are only open to solar PV (photovoltaic) generation. This means that larger scale CSP projects would not be eligible for payment for feed-in incentives in many of the State and Territory jurisdictions.

== Future ==
A study done by [[Greenpeace International]], the European Solar Thermal Electricity Association, and the [[International Energy Agency]]'s [[SolarPACES]] group investigated the potential and future of concentrated solar power. The study found that concentrated solar power could account for up to 25% of the world's energy needs by 2050. The increase in investment would be from €2 billion worldwide to €92.5 billion in that time period.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/26/solarpower-renewableenergy Concentrated solar power could generate 'quarter of world's energy'] ''Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;
Spain is the leader in concentrated solar power technology, with more than 50 government-approved projects in the works. Also, it exports its technology, further increasing the technology's stake in energy worldwide. Because the technology works best with areas of high [[insolation]] (solar radiation), experts predict the biggest growth in places like Africa, Mexico, and the southwest United States. It indicates that the thermal storage systems based in [[nitrates]] ([[Calcium nitrate|calcium]], [[Potassium nitrate|potassium]], [[Sodium nitrate|sodium]],...) will make the CSP plants more and more profitable. The study examined three different outcomes for this technology: no increases in CSP technology, investment continuing as it has been in Spain and the US, and finally the true potential of CSP without any barriers on its growth. The findings of the third part are shown in the table below:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: right; width: 330px;"
|-
! Year !! Annual&lt;br /&gt;Investment !! Cumulative&lt;br /&gt;Capacity
|-
| align=center|2015 || €21 billion || 4,755 MW
|-
| align=center|2050 || €174 billion || 1,500,000 MW
|}
Finally, the study acknowledged how technology for CSP was improving and how this would result in a drastic price decrease by 2050. It predicted a drop from the current range of €0.23–0.15/kWh to €0.14–0.10/kWh.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

The European Union looked into developing a €400 billion (US$774 billion) network of solar power plants based in the Sahara region using CSP technology to be known as [[Desertec]], to create "a new carbon-free network linking Europe, the Middle East and North Africa". The plan was backed mainly by German industrialists and predicted production of 15% of Europe's power by 2050. [[Morocco]] was a major partner in Desertec and as it has barely 1% of the electricity consumption of the EU, it could produce more than enough energy for the entire country with a large energy surplus to deliver to Europe.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;Tom Pfeiffer (23 August 2009) [https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE57N00920090824?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=11613 Europe's Saharan power plan: miracle or mirage?] ''Reuters''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Algeria]] has the biggest area of desert, and private Algerian firm [[Cevital]] signed up for Desertec.&lt;ref name="reuters.com" /&gt; With its wide desert (the highest CSP potential in the Mediterranean and Middle East regions ~ about 170&amp;nbsp;TWh/year) and its strategic geographical location near Europe, Algeria is one of the key countries to ensure the success of Desertec project. Moreover, with the abundant natural-gas reserve in the Algerian desert, this will strengthen the technical potential of Algeria in acquiring [[Hassi R'Mel integrated solar combined cycle power station|Solar-Gas Hybrid Power Plants]] for 24-hour electricity generation. Most of the participants pulled out of the effort at the end of 2014.

Other organizations had predicted CSP to cost $0.06(US)/kWh by 2015 due to efficiency improvements and mass production of equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/internal_ReutersNewsRoom_BehindTheScenes_MOLT/idUSTRE57N01720090824?sp=true CSP and photovoltaic solar power], ''Reuters'' (23 August 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; That would have made CSP as cheap as conventional power. Investors such as [[venture capitalist]] [[Vinod Khosla]] expect CSP to continuously reduce costs and actually be cheaper than coal power after 2015.

In 2009, scientists at the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL) and [[SkyFuel]] teamed to develop large curved sheets of metal that have the potential to be 30% less expensive than today's best collectors of concentrated solar power by replacing glass-based models with a [[silver]] polymer sheet that has the same performance as the heavy glass mirrors, but at much lower cost and weight. It also is much easier to deploy and install. The glossy film uses several layers of polymers, with an inner layer of pure silver.

Telescope designer [[Roger Angel]] ([[Univ. of Arizona]]) has turned his attention to [[Concentrated photovoltaics|CPV]], and is a partner in a company called Rehnu. Angel utilizes a spherical concentrating lens with large-telescope technologies, but much cheaper materials and mechanisms, to create efficient systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1117/2.3201107.02 |title=Video: Concentrating photovoltaics inspired by telescope design |date=2011 |journal=SPIE Newsroom|last1=Spie }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experience with CSP technology in 2014–2015 at Solana in Arizona, and Ivanpah in Nevada indicate large production shortfalls in electricity generation between 25% and 40% in the first years of operation. Producers blame clouds and stormy weather, but critics seem to think there are technological issues. These problems are causing utilities to pay inflated prices for wholesale electricity, and threaten the long-term viability of the technology. As photovoltaic costs continue to plummet, many think CSP has a limited future in utility-scale electricity production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/high-tech-solar-projects-fail-to-deliver-1434138485 |title=High-Tech Solar Projects Fail to Deliver |author=Cassandra Sweet |date=13 June 2015 |work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China plans to have a total capacity of 5.3&amp;nbsp;GW of [[Load following power plant|load following]] CSP power plants by 2022. 
By 2018, the [[levelised cost of electricity]] (LCOE) from CSP with 15 hours storage in China was down to 0.1 US$/kWh. 
China has reposed confidence in CSP technology for meeting its energy needs and taken global leadership to make CSP commercially competitive over other [[dispatchable generation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helioscsp.com/china-made-solar-pv-cheap-is-concentrated-solar-power-next/ |title=China Made Solar PV Cheap – Is Concentrated Solar Power Next? |accessdate=24 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
CSP with thermal storage has clear advantage in [[cogeneration]] and heating applications (process steam generation, etc.) as it can operate continuously at high efficiency.

CSP has other uses than electricity. Researchers are investigating [[Water splitting#Solar-thermal|solar thermal reactor]]s for the production of solar fuels, making solar a fully transportable form of energy in the future. These researchers use the solar heat of CSP as a catalyst for thermochemistry to break apart molecules of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, to create hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from solar energy with no carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.solarpaces.org/csp-efficient-solar-split-h2o-hydrogen/ |title=CSP is the Most Efficient Renewable to Split Water for Hydrogen|last=Kraemer|first=Susan|date=21 December 2017|work=SolarPACES.org|accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By splitting both H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, other much-used hydrocarbons – for example, the jet fuel used to fly commercial airplanes – could also be created with solar energy rather than from fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-11/s-dst111517.php |title=Desert solar to fuel centuries of air travel|last=EurekAlert! |first=|date=15 November 2017|work=EurekAlert!|accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Very large scale solar power plants ===
There have been several proposals for gigawatt size, very-large-scale solar power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.power-technology.com/features/sahara-solar-battery-europe/ |title=The Sahara: a solar battery for Europe? |accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include the Euro-Mediterranean [[Desertec]] proposal and Project Helios in Greece (10&amp;nbsp;GW), both now canceled. A 2003 study concluded that the world could generate 2,357,840&amp;nbsp;TWh each year from very large scale solar power plants using 1% of each of the world's deserts. Total consumption worldwide was 15,223&amp;nbsp;TWh/year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geni.org/globalenergy/library/energytrends/currentusage/renewable/solar/solar-systems-in-the-desert/Solar-Systems-in-the-Desert.pdf A Study of Very Large Solar Desert Systems with the Requirements and Benefits to those Nations Having High Solar Irradiation Potential]. geni.org.&lt;/ref&gt; (in 2003). The gigawatt size projects would have been arrays of standard-sized single plants. In 2012, the [[Bureau of Land Management|BLM]] made available {{convert|97,921,069|acres|abbr=off}} of land in the [[southwestern United States]] for solar projects, enough for between 10,000 and 20,000&amp;nbsp;GW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://solareis.anl.gov/maps/resource/ Solar Resource Data and Maps]. Solareis.anl.gov. Retrieved on 22 April 2013.{{Dubious|reason=Figure of 10,000 to 20,000&amp;nbsp;GW not found in citation. Figure is purely hypothetical and needs to be presented as such|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest single plant in operation is the 510&amp;nbsp;MW [[Ouarzazate Solar Power Station|Noor Solar Power Station]].

=== Suitable sites ===
The locations with highest direct irradiance are dry, at high altitude, and located in the [[tropics]]. These locations have a higher potential for CSP than areas with less sun.

Abandoned [[opencast mine]]s, moderate hill slopes and crater depressions may be advantageous in the case of power tower CSP as the power tower can be located on the ground integral with the molten salt storage tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rechargenews.com/solar/837655/solar-heads-for-the-hills-as-tower-technology-turns-upside-down |title=Solar heads for the hills as tower technology turns upside down |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental effects ==
CSP has a number of environmental effects, particularly on water use, land use and the use of hazardous materials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/our-energy-choices/renewable-energy/environmental-impacts-solar-power.html Environmental Impacts of Solar Power]&lt;/ref&gt;
Water is generally used for cooling and to clean mirrors. Cleaning agents ([[hydrochloric acid]], [[sulfuric acid]], [[nitric acid]], [[hydrogen fluoride]], [[1,1,1-trichloroethane]], [[acetone]], and others) are also used for semiconductor surface cleaning. Some projects are looking into various approaches to reduce the water and cleaning agents use, including the use of barriers, non-stick coatings on mirrors, water misting systems, and others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.euronews.com/2019/05/20/quenching-the-thirst-of-concentrated-solar-power-plants Quenching the thirst of concentrated solar power plants]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Effects on wildlife ===
[[File:Warbler burned mid-air by solar thermal power plant.jpg|thumb|Dead warbler burned in mid-air by solar thermal power plant]]

Insects can be attracted to the bright light caused by concentrated solar technology, and as a result birds that hunt them can be killed by being burned if they fly near the point where light is being focused. This can also affect [[Bird of prey|raptors]] who hunt the birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/burned-birds-become-new-environmental-victims-energy-quest-n184426 |title=Burned Birds Become New Environmental Victims of the Energy Quest |author=John Roach |work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/news/solar-plant-dead-birds-081914 |title=Solar Thermal Plants Have a PR Problem, And That PR Problem Is Dead Birds Catching on Fire |author=Michael Howard |date=20 August 2014|work=Esquire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.foxnews.com/science/2014/08/18/california-weighing-bird-deaths-from-concentrated-solar-plants-as-it-considers/ |title=Emerging solar plants scorch birds in mid-air |work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/emerging-solar-plants-scorch-birds-mid-air|title=Associated Press News|website=bigstory.ap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal wildlife officials were quoted by opponents as calling the Ivanpah power towers "mega traps" for wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/12918/20150223/solar-farm-set-hundreds-birds-ablaze.htm |title=How a Solar Farm Set Hundreds of Birds Ablaze |work=Nature World News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/green-tech/solar/ivanpah-solar-plant-turns-birds-into-smoke-streamers |title=Ivanpah Solar Power Tower Is Burning Birds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150303225011/http://www.kcet.org/news/redefine/rewire/Avian-mortality%20Report%20FINALclean.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to rigorous reporting, in over six months, 133 singed birds were counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2014/09/for-the-birds-how-speculation-trumped-fact-at-ivanpah |title=For the Birds: How Speculation Trumped Fact at Ivanpah |publisher=RenewableEnergyWorld.com |accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By focusing no more than four mirrors on any one place in the air during standby, at [[Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project]], in three months, the death rate dropped to zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cleantechnica.com/2015/04/16/one-weird-trick-prevents-bird-deaths-solar-towers/ |title=One Weird Trick Prevents Bird Deaths At Solar Towers |publisher= CleanTechnica.com |accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than in the US, no bird deaths have been reported at CSP plants internationally.
