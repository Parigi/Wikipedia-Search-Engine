The deoxyribose sugar joined only to the nitrogenous base forms a &lt;u title="Nucleotide"&gt;[[Deoxyribonucleoside]]&lt;/u&gt;  called [[deoxyadenosine]], whereas the whole structure along with the phosphate group is a &lt;u title="Deoxyadenosine monophosphate" href="deoxyadenosine monophosphate"&gt;nucleotide&lt;/u&gt;, a constituent of DNA with the name [[deoxyadenosine monophosphate]].]]

'''Nucleotides''' are [[organic molecules]] consisting of a [[nucleoside]] and a [[phosphate]]. They serve as [[monomer]]ic units of the [[nucleic acid]] [[polymers]] [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) and [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA), both of which are essential [[biomolecules]] within all [[RNA world#Prebiotic RNA synthesis|life-forms]] on Earth. Nucleotides are composed of three subunit molecules: a [[nitrogenous base]] (also known as [[nucleobase]]), a [[pentose|five-carbon sugar]] ([[ribose]] or [[deoxyribose]]), and a phosphate group consisting of one to three [[phosphate]]s.  The four nitrogenous bases in DNA are [[guanine]], [[adenine]], [[cytosine]] and [[thymine]]; in RNA, [[uracil]] is used in place of thymine.

Nucleotides also play a central role in [[metabolism]] at a fundamental, cellular level. They provide chemical energy—in the form of the [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s, [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP), [[cytidine triphosphate]] (CTP) and [[uridine triphosphate]] (UTP)—throughout the cell for the many cellular functions that demand energy, including: [[amino acid]], [[protein]] and [[cell membrane]] synthesis, moving the cell and cell parts (both internally and intercellularly), cell division, etc.&lt;ref name=Alberts&gt;Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K &amp; Walter P (2002). ''Molecular Biology of the Cell'' (4th ed.). Garland Science. {{ISBN|0-8153-3218-1}}. pp. 120–121.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, nucleotides participate in [[cell signaling]] ([[cyclic guanosine monophosphate]] or cGMP and [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] or cAMP), and are incorporated into important [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] of enzymatic reactions (e.g. [[coenzyme A]], [[flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]], [[flavin mononucleotide|FMN]], [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]], and [[NADP+|NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]).

In experimental [[biochemistry]], nucleotides can be [[radiolabeled]] using [[radionuclide]]s to yield radionucleotides.

== Structure ==
[[File:0322 DNA Nucleotides.jpg|thumb|370px|Showing the arrangement of nucleotides within the structure of nucleic acids: At lower left, a monophosphate nucleotide; its nitrogenous base represents one side of a base-pair. At upper right, four nucleotides form two base-pairs: thymine and adenine (connected by ''double'' hydrogen bonds) and guanine and cytosine (connected by ''triple'' hydrogen bonds). The individual nucleotide monomers are chain-joined at their sugar and phosphate molecules, forming two 'backbones' (a [[double helix]]) of a nucleic acid, shown at upper left.]]

A nucleo&lt;u&gt;tide&lt;/u&gt; is composed of three distinctive chemical sub-units: a five-carbon sugar molecule, a [[nitrogenous base]]—which two together are called a [[nucleoside|nucleo&lt;u&gt;side&lt;/u&gt;]]—and one [[phosphate group]]. With all three joined, a nucleotide is also termed a "nucleo&lt;u&gt;side&lt;/u&gt; ''mono''phosphate", "nucleoside ''di''phosphate" or "nucleoside ''tri''phosphate", depending on how many phosphates make up the phosphate group.

In [[nucleic acid]]s, nucleotides contain either a [[purine]] or a [[pyrimidine]] base—i.e., the nitrogenous base molecule, also known as a [[nucleobase]]—and are termed ''ribo''nucleotides if the sugar is ribose, or ''deoxyribo''nucleotides if the sugar is deoxyribose. Individual phosphate molecules repetitively connect the [[ribose|sugar-ring]] molecules in two adjacent nucleotide monomers, thereby connecting the nucleotide monomers of a nucleic acid end-to-end into a long chain. These chain-joins of sugar and phosphate molecules create a 'backbone' strand for a single- or [[double helix]]. In any one strand, the chemical orientation ([[directionality (molecular biology)|directionality]]) of the chain-joins runs from the [[Directionality (molecular biology)#5′-end|5'-end]] to the [[Directionality (molecular biology)#3'-end|3'-end]] (''read'': 5 prime-end to 3 prime-end)—referring to the five carbon sites on sugar molecules in adjacent nucleotides. In a double helix, the two strands are oriented in opposite directions, which permits [[base pairing]] and [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementarity]] between the base-pairs, all which is essential for [[DNA replication|replicating]] or [[transcription (genetics)|transcribing]] the encoded information found in DNA.

Nucleic acids then are [[polymeric]] [[macromolecule]]s assembled from nucleotides, the [[monomer|monomer-units of nucleic acids]]. The purine bases [[adenine]] and [[guanine]] and pyrimidine base [[cytosine]] occur in both DNA and RNA, while the pyrimidine bases [[thymine]] (in DNA) and [[uracil]] (in RNA) occur in just one. Adenine forms a [[base pair]] with thymine with two hydrogen bonds, while guanine pairs with cytosine with three hydrogen bonds.

In addition to being building blocks for construction of nucleic acid polymers, singular nucleotides play roles in cellular energy storage and provision, cellular signaling, as a source of phosphate groups used to modulate the activity of proteins and other signaling molecules, and as enzymatic [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]], often carrying out [[redox]] reactions.  Signaling [[cyclic nucleotides]] are formed by binding the phosphate group twice to the same sugar molecule, bridging the 5'- and 3'- [[hydroxyl group]]s of the sugar.&lt;ref name="Alberts" /&gt;  Some signaling nucleotides differ from the standard single-phosphate group configuration, in having multiple phosphate groups attached to different positions on the sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Smith|editor-first=A. D.|title=Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Revised edition|year=2000|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=460}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nucleotide cofactors include a wider range of chemical groups attached to the sugar via the [[glycosidic bond]], including [[nicotinamide]] and [[Flavin group|flavin]], and in the latter case, the ribose sugar is linear rather than forming the ring seen in other nucleotides.

==Synthesis==
Nucleotides can be synthesized by a variety of means both [[in vitro]] and [[in vivo]].

In vitro, [[protecting group]]s may be used during laboratory production of nucleotides. A purified [[nucleoside]] is protected to create a [[phosphoramidite]], which can then be used to obtain analogues not found in nature and/or to [[oligonucleotide synthesis|synthesize an oligonucleotide]].

In vivo, nucleotides can be synthesized [[de novo synthesis|de novo]] or recycled through [[nucleotide salvage|salvage pathways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zaharevitz DW, Anderson LW, Malinowski NM, Hyman R, Strong JM, Cysyk RL | title = Contribution of de-novo and salvage synthesis to the uracil nucleotide pool in mouse tissues and tumors in vivo | journal = European Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 210 | issue = 1 | pages = 293–6 | date = November 1992 | pmid = 1446677 | doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1992.tb17420.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The components used in de novo nucleotide synthesis are derived from biosynthetic precursors of carbohydrate and [[amino acid]] metabolism, and from ammonia and carbon dioxide. The liver is the major organ of de novo synthesis of  all four nucleotides. De novo synthesis of pyrimidines and purines follows two different pathways. Pyrimidines are synthesized first from aspartate and carbamoyl-phosphate in the cytoplasm to the common precursor ring structure orotic acid, onto which a phosphorylated ribosyl unit is covalently linked. Purines, however, are first synthesized from the sugar template onto which the ring synthesis occurs. For reference, the syntheses of the [[purine]] and [[pyrimidine]] nucleotides are carried out by several enzymes in the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell, not within a specific [[organelle]]. Nucleotides undergo breakdown such that useful parts can be reused in synthesis reactions to create new nucleotides.

===Pyrimidine ribonucleotide synthesis===
[[File:Nucleotides syn2.png|thumb|right|400px|&lt;div style="border-width: 0px; border-bottom: 1px solid black; text-align: left;"&gt;'''The synthesis of [[Uridine monophosphate|UMP]]'''.&lt;/div&gt;The color scheme is as follows: &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;enzymes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color: rgb(219,155,36);"&gt;coenzymes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color: rgb(151,149,45);"&gt;substrate names&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color: rgb(128,0,0);"&gt;inorganic molecules&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;]]

{{main|Pyrimidine metabolism}}

The synthesis of the pyrimidines CTP and UTP occurs in the cytoplasm and starts with the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from [[glutamine]] and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Next, [[aspartate carbamoyltransferase]] catalyzes a condensation reaction between [[aspartate]] and [[carbamoyl phosphate]] to form [[carbamoyl aspartic acid]], which is cyclized into [[4,5-dihydroorotic acid]] by [[dihydroorotase]]. The latter is converted to [[orotate]] by [[dihydroorotate oxidase]]. The net reaction is:

:(''S'')-Dihydroorotate + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Orotate + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Orotate is covalently linked with a phosphorylated ribosyl unit. The covalent linkage between the ribose and pyrimidine occurs at position C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry]] for details on carbon residue numbering&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[ribose]] unit, which contains a [[pyrophosphate]], and N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of the pyrimidine ring. [[Orotate phosphoribosyltransferase]] (PRPP transferase) catalyzes the net reaction yielding orotidine monophosphate (OMP):

:Orotate + [[Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate|5-Phospho-α-D-ribose 1-diphosphate (PRPP)]]  →  Orotidine 5'-phosphate + Pyrophosphate

[[Orotidine 5'-monophosphate]] is decarboxylated by orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase to form uridine monophosphate (UMP). PRPP transferase catalyzes both the ribosylation and decarboxylation reactions, forming UMP from orotic acid in the presence of PRPP. It is from UMP that other pyrimidine nucleotides are derived.  UMP is phosphorylated by two kinases to uridine triphosphate (UTP) via two sequential reactions with ATP.  First the diphosphate form UDP is produced, which in turn is phosphorylated to UTP. Both steps are fueled by ATP hydrolysis:

:ATP + UMP → ADP + UDP

:UDP + ATP → UTP + ADP

CTP is subsequently formed by amination of UTP by the catalytic activity of [[CTP synthetase]]. Glutamine is the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; donor and the reaction is fueled by ATP hydrolysis, too:

:UTP + Glutamine + ATP + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → CTP + ADP + P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;

Cytidine monophosphate (CMP) is derived from cytidine triphosphate (CTP) with subsequent loss of two phosphates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones ME | title = Pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis in animals: genes, enzymes, and regulation of UMP biosynthesis | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 253–79 | date = 1980 | pmid = 6105839 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.49.070180.001345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purine ribonucleotide synthesis===

The atoms that are used to build the [[purine nucleotides]] come from a variety of sources:

|}

The [[de novo synthesis]] of [[purine nucleotides]] by which these precursors are incorporated into the purine ring proceeds by a 10-step pathway to the branch-point intermediate [[Inosine monophosphate|IMP]], the nucleotide of the base [[hypoxanthine]]. [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]] and [[Guanosine monophosphate|GMP]] are subsequently synthesized from this intermediate via separate, two-step pathways. Thus, purine [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]] are initially formed as part of the [[ribonucleotides]] rather than as [[Freebase (chemistry)|free bases]].

Six enzymes take part in IMP synthesis. Three of them are multifunctional:
* [[Phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase|GART]] (reactions 2, 3, and 5)
* [[Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase|PAICS]] (reactions 6, and 7)
* [[Inosine monophosphate synthase|ATIC]] (reactions 9, and 10)

The pathway starts with the formation of [[PRPP]]. [[PRPS1]] is the [[enzyme]] that activates [[R5P]], which is formed primarily by the [[pentose phosphate pathway]], to [[PRPP]] by reacting it with [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. The reaction is unusual in that a pyrophosphoryl group is directly transferred from ATP to C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of [[R5P]] and that the product has the '''α''' configuration about C1. This reaction is also shared with the pathways for the synthesis of [[Tryptophan|Trp]], [[Histidine|His]], and the [[pyrimidine nucleotides]]. Being on a major metabolic crossroad and requiring much energy, this reaction is highly regulated.

In the first reaction unique to purine nucleotide biosynthesis, [[PPAT]] catalyzes the displacement of [[PRPP]]'s [[pyrophosphate]] group (PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) by an amide nitrogen donated from either [[glutamine]] (N), [[glycine]] (N&amp;C), [[aspartate]] (N), [[folic acid]] (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This is the committed step in purine synthesis. The reaction occurs with the inversion of configuration about ribose C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby forming '''β'''-[[5-phosphorybosylamine]] (5-PRA) and establishing the anomeric form of the future nucleotide.

Next, a glycine is incorporated fueled by ATP hydrolysis and the carboxyl group forms an amine bond to the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; previously introduced. A one-carbon unit from folic acid coenzyme N&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;-formyl-THF is then added to the amino group of the substituted glycine followed by the closure of the imidazole ring. Next, a second NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group is transferred from a glutamine to the first carbon of the glycine unit. A carboxylation of the second carbon of the glycin unit is concomitantly added. This new carbon is modified by the additional of a third NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unit, this time transferred from an aspartate residue. Finally, a second one-carbon unit from formyl-THF is added to the nitrogen group and the ring covalently closed to form the common purine precursor inosine monophosphate (IMP).

Inosine monophosphate is converted to adenosine monophosphate in two steps. First, GTP hydrolysis fuels the addition of aspartate to IMP by adenylosuccinate synthase, substituting the carbonyl oxygen for a nitrogen and forming the intermediate adenylosuccinate. Fumarate is then cleaved off forming adenosine monophosphate. This step is catalyzed by adenylosuccinate lyase.

Inosine monophosphate is converted to guanosine monophosphate by the oxidation of IMP forming xanthylate, followed by the insertion of an amino group at C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the electron acceptor in the oxidation reaction. The amide group transfer from glutamine is fueled by ATP hydrolysis.

===Pyrimidine and purine degradation===
In humans, pyrimidine rings (C, T, U) can be degraded completely to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (urea excretion). That having been said, purine rings (G, A) cannot. Instead they are degraded to the metabolically inert [[uric acid]] which is then excreted from the body. Uric acid is formed when GMP is split into the base guanine and ribose. Guanine is deaminated to xanthine which in turn is oxidized to uric acid. This last reaction is irreversible. Similarly, uric acid can be formed when AMP is deaminated to IMP from which the ribose unit is removed to form hypoxanthine. Hypoxanthine is oxidized to xanthine and finally to uric acid. Instead of uric acid secretion, guanine and IMP can be used for recycling purposes and nucleic acid synthesis in the presence of PRPP and aspartate (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; donor).

==Unnatural base pair (UBP)==

{{Main|Base pair#Unnatural base pair (UBP)}}
An unnatural base pair (UBP) is a designed subunit (or [[nucleobase]]) of [[DNA]] which is created in a laboratory and does not occur in nature. In 2012, a group of American scientists led by Floyd Romesberg, a chemical biologist at the [[Scripps Research Institute]] in San Diego, California, published that his team designed an unnatural base pair (UBP).&lt;ref name="Malyshev PNAS 20120724"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Malyshev DA, Dhami K, Quach HT, Lavergne T, Ordoukhanian P, Torkamani A, Romesberg FE | title = Efficient and sequence-independent replication of DNA containing a third base pair establishes a functional six-letter genetic alphabet | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 30 | pages = 12005–10 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22773812 | pmc = 3409741 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1205176109 | bibcode = 2012PNAS..10912005M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two new artificial nucleotides or ''Unnatural Base Pair'' (UBP) were named '''[[d5SICS]]''' and '''[[dNaM]]'''. More technically, these artificial nucleotides bearing hydrophobic [[nucleobase]]s, feature two fused [[Aromatic hydrocarbon|aromatic rings]] that form a (d5SICS–dNaM) complex or base pair in DNA.&lt;ref name="NATJ-20140507" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ewan"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/07/living-organism-artificial-dna_n_5283095.html |title=Scientists Create First Living Organism With 'Artificial' DNA| last=Callaway| first=Ewan | name-list-format = vanc |date=May 7, 2014| work=Nature News| publisher=Huffington Post| access-date=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the same team from the Scripps Research Institute reported that they synthesized a stretch of circular DNA known as a [[plasmid]] containing natural T-A and C-G base pairs along with the best-performing UBP Romesberg's laboratory had designed, and inserted it into cells of the common bacterium ''E. coli'' that successfully replicated the unnatural base pairs through multiple generations.&lt;ref name="Fikes"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/may/08/tp-life-engineered-with-expanded-genetic-code/| title=Life engineered with expanded genetic code| last=Fikes| first=Bradley J. | name-list-format = vanc | date=May 8, 2014 |work=San Diego Union Tribune| access-date=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first known example of a living organism passing along an expanded genetic code to subsequent generations.&lt;ref name="NATJ-20140507"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Malyshev DA, Dhami K, Lavergne T, Chen T, Dai N, Foster JM, Corrêa IR, Romesberg FE | title = A semi-synthetic organism with an expanded genetic alphabet | journal = Nature | volume = 509 | issue = 7500 | pages = 385–8 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24805238 | pmc = 4058825 | doi = 10.1038/nature13314 | bibcode = 2014Natur.509..385M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sample"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/07/living-organism-pass-down-artificial-dna-us-scientists| title=First life forms to pass on artificial DNA engineered by US scientists| last=Sample|first=Ian | name-list-format = vanc |date=May 7, 2014|work=The Guardian|access-date=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was in part achieved by the addition of a supportive algal gene that expresses a [[Nucleoside triphosphate|nucleotide triphosphate]] transporter which efficiently imports the triphosphates of both d5SICSTP and dNaMTP into ''E. coli'' bacteria.&lt;ref name="NATJ-20140507"/&gt; Then, the natural bacterial replication pathways use them to accurately replicate the [[plasmid]] containing d5SICS–dNaM.

The successful incorporation of a third base pair is a significant breakthrough toward the goal of greatly expanding the number of amino acids which can be encoded by DNA, from the existing 21 amino acids to a theoretically possible 172, thereby expanding the potential for living organisms to produce novel [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name="Fikes"/&gt; The artificial strings of DNA do not encode for anything yet, but scientists speculate they could be designed to manufacture new proteins which could have industrial or pharmaceutical uses.&lt;ref name="Pollack"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/business/researchers-report-breakthrough-in-creating-artificial-genetic-code.html?hpw&amp;rref=business&amp;_r=0| title=Scientists Add Letters to DNA's Alphabet, Raising Hope and Fear |last=Pollack| first=Andrew| name-list-format = vanc | date=May 7, 2014| work=New York Times| access-date=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Length unit ==
Nucleotide (abbreviated "nt") is a common unit of length for single-stranded nucleic acids, similar to how [[base pair]] is a unit of length for double-stranded nucleic acids.

== Nucleotide supplements ==
A study done by the Department of Sports Science at the University of Hull in Hull, UK has shown that nucleotides have significant impact on [[cortisol]] levels in saliva. Post exercise, the experimental nucleotide group had lower cortisol levels in their blood than the control or the placebo. Additionally, post supplement values of [[Immunoglobulin A]] were significantly higher than either the placebo or the control. The study concluded, "nucleotide supplementation blunts the response of the hormones associated with physiological stress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mc Naughton L, Bentley D, Koeppel P | title = The effects of a nucleotide supplement on the immune and metabolic response to short term, high intensity exercise performance in trained male subjects | journal = The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 112–8 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17369807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study conducted in 2013 looked at the impact nucleotide supplementation had on the immune system in athletes. In the study, all athletes were male and were highly skilled in [[taekwondo]]. Out of the twenty athletes tested, half received a placebo and half received 480&amp;nbsp;mg per day of nucleotide supplement. After thirty days, the study concluded that nucleotide supplementation may counteract the impairment of the body's immune function after heavy exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Riera J, Pons V, Martinez-Puig D, Chetrit C, Tur JA, Pons A, Drobnic F | title = Dietary nucleotide improves markers of immune response to strenuous exercise under a cold environment | journal = Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 20 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23566489 | pmc = 3626726 | doi = 10.1186/1550-2783-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abbreviation codes for degenerate bases ==
{{main|Nucleic acid notation}}
The [[IUPAC]] has designated the symbols for nucleotides.&lt;ref name="iupac"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/misc/naseq.html |author=Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB) |title=Nomenclature for Incompletely Specified Bases in Nucleic Acid Sequences |date=1984 |access-date=2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the five (A, G, C, T/U) bases, often degenerate bases are used especially for designing [[Primer (molecular biology)|PCR primers]]. These nucleotide codes are listed here.  Some primer sequences may also include the character "I", which codes for the non-standard nucleotide [[inosine]].  Inosine occurs in tRNAs, and will pair with adenine, cytosine, or thymine.  This character does not appear in the following table however, because it does not represent a degeneracy.  While inosine can serve a similar function as the degeneracy "D", it is an actual nucleotide, rather than a representation of a mix of nucleotides that covers each possible pairing needed.
