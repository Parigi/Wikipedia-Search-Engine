{{Ancient Egyptian religion}}
'''Thoth''' ({{IPAc-en|θ|oʊ|θ|,_|t|oʊ|t}}; from {{lang-grc-koi|Θώθ}} ''{{transl|grc|thṓth}}'', borrowed from {{lang-cop|Ⲑⲱⲟⲩⲧ}}, the reflex of {{lang-egy|[[wikt:ḏḥwtj|ḏḥwtj]]}} "[He] is like the Ibis") is an [[ancient Egyptian deity]]. In art, he was often depicted as a man with the head of an [[African sacred ibis|ibis]] or a [[baboon]], animals sacred to him. His feminine counterpart was [[Seshat]], and his wife was [[Ma'at]].&lt;ref&gt;''Thutmose III: A New Biography By Eric H Cline'', David O'Connor University of Michigan Press (January 5, 2006)p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; He was the god of wisdom, writing, hieroglyphs, science, magic, art, judgment, and the dead.

Thoth's chief [[Egyptian temple|temple]] was located in the city of [[Hermopolis]] ({{lang-egy|[[wikt:ḫmnw|ḫmnw]]}} {{ipa|/χaˈmaːnaw/}}, [[Egyptological pronunciation]]: "Khemenu", {{lang-cop|Ϣⲙⲟⲩⲛ}} ''Shmun''). Later known as ''el-Ashmunein'' in [[Egyptian Arabic]], it was partially destroyed in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;Miroslav Verner, Temple of the World: Sanctuaries, Cults, and Mysteries of Ancient Egypt (2013) 149&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hermopolis, Thoth led "the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]]", a [[pantheon (religion)|pantheon]] of eight principal deities, and his spouse was [[Nehmetawy]]. He also had numerous shrines in other cities.&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Thoth was said to be born from the skull of Set also said to be born from the heart of Ra.p. 401)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thoth played many vital and prominent roles in [[Egyptian mythology]], such as maintaining the universe, and being one of the two deities (the other being Ma'at) who stood on either side of [[Solar deity#Solar barge and sun chariot|Ra's solar barge]].&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 400)&lt;/ref&gt; In the later history of ancient Egypt, Thoth became heavily associated with the arbitration of godly disputes,&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 405)&lt;/ref&gt; the arts of magic, the system of writing, the development of science,&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 414)&lt;/ref&gt; and the judgment of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' p. 403)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==

===Etymology===
{{Hiero|Common names for Thoth&lt;ref&gt;Hieroglyphs verified, in part, in (Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 402) and (Collier and Manley p. 161)&lt;/ref&gt;|
&lt;hiero&gt;G26-t:Z4-A40&lt;/hiero&gt;&lt;br&gt;or &lt;hiero&gt;D-H-w-t:Z4-R8&lt;/hiero&gt;
|align=right|era=egypt}}

The [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] pronunciation of ''ḏḥwty'' is not fully known, but may be reconstructed as *''ḏiḥautī,'' perhaps pronounced *{{IPA|[t͡ʃʼi.ˈħau.tʰiː]}} or *{{IPA|[ci.ˈħau.tʰiː]}}. This reconstruction is based on the [[Ancient Greek]] borrowing ''{{transl|grc|Thōth}}'' ({{lang|grc|Θώθ}} {{IPA|[tʰɔːtʰ]}}) or ''{{transl|grc|Theut}}'' and the fact that the name was transliterated into [[Coptic language|Sahidic Coptic]] variously as {{Script/Coptic|ⲑⲟⲟⲩⲧ}} ''Thoout'', {{Script/Coptic|ⲑⲱⲑ}} ''Thōth'', {{Script/Coptic|ⲑⲟⲟⲧ}} ''Thoot'', {{Script/Coptic|ⲑⲁⲩⲧ}} ''Thaut'', as well as [[Coptic language|Bohairic Coptic]] {{Script/Coptic|ⲑⲱⲟⲩⲧ}} ''Thōout''. These spellings reflect known sound changes from earlier Egyptian such as the loss of ''ḏ'' palatalization and merger of ''ḥ'' with ''h'' i.e. initial ''ḏḥ &gt; th &gt; tʰ.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd6aAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=ancient%20egyptian%20allen%20phonology&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20egyptian%20allen%20phonology&amp;f=false|title=The Ancient Egyptian Language: An Historical Study|last=Allen|first=James P.|date=2013-07-11|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107032460|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of pre-Coptic final ''y/j'' is also common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gd6aAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=ancient%20egyptian%20allen%20phonology&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20egyptian%20allen%20phonology&amp;f=false|title=The Ancient Egyptian Language: An Historical Study|last=Allen|first=James P.|date=2013-07-11|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107032460|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Egyptological convention, which eschews vowel reconstruction, the consonant skeleton ''ḏḥwty'' would be rendered "Djehuti" and the god is sometimes found under this name. However, the Greek form "Thoth" is more common.

According to Theodor Hopfner,&lt;ref&gt;Hopfner, Theodor, b. 1886. Der tierkult der alten Agypter nach den griechisch-romischen berichten und den wichtigeren denkmalern. Wien, In kommission bei A. Holder, 1913. Call#= 060 VPD v.57&lt;/ref&gt; Thoth's Egyptian name written as ''ḏḥwty'' originated from ''ḏḥw'', claimed to be the oldest known name for the [[African sacred ibis|ibis]], normally written as ''hbj''. The addition of ''-ty'' denotes that he possessed the attributes of the ibis.&lt;ref name="Budge p. 402"&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 402)&lt;/ref&gt; Hence Thoth's name would mean "He who is like the ibis", according to this interpretation.

===Further names and spellings===
Other forms of the name ''ḏḥwty'' using older transcriptions include ''Jehuti, Jehuty, Tahuti, Tehuti, Zehuti, Techu,'' or ''Tetu''. Multiple titles for Thoth, similar to the [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary|pharaonic titulary]], are also known, including ''A'', ''Sheps'', ''Lord of Khemennu'', ''Asten'', ''Khenti'', ''Mehi'', ''Hab'', and ''A'an''.&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;1 pp.&amp;nbsp;402–3)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Thoth was also known by specific aspects of himself, for instance the Moon god [[Iah]]-Djehuty (''j3ḥ-ḏḥw.ty)'', representing the Moon for the entire month.&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;1 pp.&amp;nbsp;412–3)&lt;/ref&gt;
The Greeks related Thoth to their god [[Hermes]] due to his similar attributes and functions.&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' p.&amp;nbsp;402)&lt;/ref&gt;
One of Thoth's titles, "Thrice great", was translated to the Greek {{lang|grc|τρισμέγιστος}} (''{{transl|grc|trismégistos}}''), making [[Hermes Trismegistus]].&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;1 p.&amp;nbsp;415)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thoth has been depicted in many ways depending on the era and on the aspect the artist wished to convey. Usually, he is depicted in his human form with the head of an [[African sacred ibis|ibis]].&lt;ref name="Budge 401"&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 401)&lt;/ref&gt; In this form, he can be represented as the reckoner of times and seasons by a [[headdress]] of the lunar disk sitting on top of a crescent moon resting on his head. When depicted as a form of [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] or Ankher, he was depicted to be wearing the respective god's headdress. Sometimes he was also seen in art to be wearing the [[Atef]] crown or the [[Pschent|United Crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Budge p. 402"/&gt; When not depicted in this common form, he sometimes takes the form of the ibis directly.&lt;ref name="Budge 401" /&gt;

He also appears as a dog-faced [[baboon]] or a man with the head of a baboon when he is A'an, the god of equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 403)&lt;/ref&gt; In the form of A'ah-Djehuty he took a more human-looking form.&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 plate between pp. 408–9)&lt;/ref&gt; These forms are all [[symbol]]ic and are [[metaphor]]s for Thoth's attributes.

Thoth's roles in Egyptian mythology were many. He served as scribe of the gods,&lt;ref name="Budge p. 408"&gt;(Budge ''Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 408)&lt;/ref&gt; credited with the invention of writing and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]].&lt;ref name="Budge p. 414"&gt;(Budge ''Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 414)&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[underworld]], [[Duat]], he appeared as an ape, [[Aani]], the god of equilibrium, who reported when the scales weighing the deceased's heart against the feather, representing the principle of Maat, was exactly even.&lt;ref&gt;(Budge ''Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 403)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Egyptians regarded Thoth as One, self-begotten, and self-produced.&lt;ref name="Budge 401" /&gt; He was the master of both physical and [[morality|moral]] (i.e. [[divinity|divine]]) law,&lt;ref name="Budge 401" /&gt; making proper use of Ma'at.&lt;ref name="Budge 407"&gt;(Budge ''The Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 407)&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with making the calculations for the establishment of the heavens, stars, Earth,&lt;ref name="Budge p. 401"&gt;(Budge ''Gods of the Egyptians'' Vol. 1 p. 401)&lt;/ref&gt; and everything in them.&lt;ref name="Budge 407" /&gt;

The Egyptians credited him as the author of all works of science, religion, philosophy, and magic.&lt;ref&gt;(Hall ''The Hermetic Marriage'' p. 224)&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks further declared him the inventor of [[astronomy]], [[astrology]], [[numerology|the science of numbers]], [[mathematics]], [[geometry]], [[surveying]], [[medicine]], [[botany]], [[theology]], civilized government, the alphabet, reading, writing, and [[public speaking|oratory]]. They further claimed he was the true author of every work of every branch of knowledge, human and divine.&lt;ref name="Budge p. 414"/&gt;

[[File:El pesado del corazón en el Papiro de Hunefer.jpg|thumb|300px|left|This detail scene, from the Papyrus of [[Hunefer]] (c. 1275 BCE), shows the scribe Hunefer's heart being weighed on the scale of [[Maat]] against the feather of truth, by the jackal-headed [[Anubis]]. The ibis-headed Thoth, scribe of the gods, records the result. If his heart equals exactly the weight of the feather, Hunefer is allowed to pass into the afterlife. If not, he is eaten by the waiting chimeric devouring creature [[Ammit]] composed of the deadly crocodile, lion, and hippopotamus. Vignettes such as these were a common illustration in Egyptian books of the dead. ]]
Thoth has played a prominent role in many of the Egyptian myths.  In the [[Osiris myth]], being of great aid to [[Isis]]. After Isis gathered together the pieces of Osiris's dismembered body, he gave her the words to resurrect him so she could be impregnated and bring forth Horus. After a battle between Horus and Set in which the latter plucked out Horus' eye, Thoth's counsel provided him the wisdom he needed to recover it.

This mythology also credits him with the creation of the 365-day calendar. Originally, according to the myth, the year was only 360 days long and [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] was sterile during these days, unable to bear children. Thoth gambled with the Moon for 1/72nd of its light (360/72 = 5), or 5 days, and won. During these 5 days, Nut and [[Geb]] gave birth to [[Osiris]], [[Set (deity)|Set]], [[Isis]], and [[Nephthys]].

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2015}}
[[Image:thothbw1.JPG|right|thumb|Thoth, sitting on his throne]]
[[File:Cylinder seal and modern impression king holding two lion griffins at bay and Egyptian hieroglyphs ca. 6th–5th century BC.jpg|thumb|Modern impression of an [[Achaemenid]] cylinder seal from [[Iran]], with king holding two lion griffins at bay and Egyptian [[hieroglyphs]] reading "Thoth is a protection over me". Circa 6th–5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Museum item, accession number: 36.106.2 |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/323560 |website=www.metmuseum.org |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Thoth was originally a Moon god. The Moon not only provides light at night, allowing time to still be measured without the sun, but its phases and prominence gave it a significant importance in early astrology/astronomy. The perceived cycles of the Moon also organized much of Egyptian society's rituals and events, both civil and religious. Consequently, Thoth gradually became seen as a god of [[wisdom]], [[magic and religion|magic]], and the measurement and regulation of events and of time.&lt;ref&gt;Assmann, Jan, ''The Search for God in Ancient Egypt'', 2001, pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; He was thus said to be the secretary and counselor of the [[solar deity|sun god]] Ra, and with Ma'at (truth/order) stood next to Ra on the nightly voyage across the sky.

Thoth became credited by the ancient Egyptians as the inventor of writing ([[Hieroglyph|hieroglyphs]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mythology. The illustrated anthology of world myth &amp; storytelling|last=Littleton|first=C.Scott|publisher=Duncan Baird Publishers|year=2002|isbn=9781903296370|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mythologyillustr0000unse_i7i9/page/24 24]|url=https://archive.org/details/mythologyillustr0000unse_i7i9/page/24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also considered to have been the scribe of the underworld. For this reason, Thoth was universally worshipped by ancient Egyptian scribes. Many scribes had a painting or a picture of Thoth in their "office". Likewise, one of the symbols for scribes was that of the ibis.

In art, Thoth was usually depicted with the head of an ibis, possibly because the Egyptians saw the curve of the ibis' beak as a symbol of the crescent moon.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Richard H., ''The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt'', 2003, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, he was depicted as a baboon holding up a crescent moon.

During the [[History of Egypt|late period of Egyptian history]], a cult of Thoth gained prominence due to its main center, Khmun ([[Hermopolis Magna]]), also becoming the capital. Millions of dead ibis were mummified and buried in his honor.

Thoth was inserted in many tales as the wise counselor and persuader, and his association with learning and measurement led him to be connected with [[Seshat]], the earlier deification of wisdom, who was said to be his daughter, or variably his wife. Thoth's qualities also led to him being identified by the Greeks with their closest matching god Hermes, with whom Thoth was eventually combined as Hermes Trismegistus, leading to the Greeks' naming Thoth's cult center as Hermopolis, meaning ''city of Hermes''.

In the [[Papyrus of Ani]] copy of the [[Egyptian Book of the Dead]] the scribe proclaims "I am thy [[scribe's palette|writing palette]], O Thoth, and I have brought unto thee thine ink-jar. I am not of those who work iniquity in their secret places; let not evil happen unto me."&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of the Dead'' by [[E. A. Wallis Budge]], 1895, Gramercy, 1999, p. 562, {{ISBN|0-517-12283-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter XXXb (Budge) of the Book of the Dead is by the oldest tradition said to be the work of Thoth himself.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of the Dead'' by [[E. A. Wallis Budge]], 1895, Gramercy, 1999, p. 282, {{ISBN|0-517-12283-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also an Egyptian pharaoh of the [[Sixteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Sixteenth dynasty]] named Djehuty (Thoth) after him, and who reigned for three years.

[[Artapanus of Alexandria]], an Egyptian Jew who lived in the third or second century BC, [[euhemerism|euhemerized]] Thoth-Hermes as a historical human being and claimed he was the same person as [[Moses]], based primarily on their shared roles as authors of texts and creators of laws. Artapanus's biography of Moses conflates traditions about Moses and Thoth and invents many details.&lt;ref&gt;Mussies, Gerald (1982), "The Interpretatio Judaica of Thot-Hermes", in van Voss, Heerma, et al. (eds.) ''Studies in Egyptian Religion Dedicated to Professor Jan Zandee'', pp. 91, 97, 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; Many later authors, from [[late antiquity]] to the [[Renaissance]], either identified Hermes Trismegistus with Moses or regarded them as contemporaries who expounded similar beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Mussies (1982), pp. 118–120&lt;/ref&gt;
