The '''legacy of the Roman Empire''' has been varied and significant, comparable to that of other [[hegemony|hegemonic]] [[polity|polities]] of world history (e.g. [[Persian Empire]], [[ancient Egypt]] or [[imperial China]]).

The [[Roman Empire]] itself, built upon the legacy of other cultures such as [[Ancient Greece]], has had long-lasting influence with broad geographical reach on a great range of cultural aspects, including state institutions, [[civil law (legal system)|law]], cultural values, religious beliefs, technological advances, engineering and language.

This legacy survived [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|the demise]] of the empire itself (5th century AD in the West, and [[Fall of Constantinople|15th century AD]] in the [[Eastern Roman Empire|East]]) and went on to shape other civilisations, a process which continues to this day. The city of [[Rome]] was the ''civitas'' (reflected in the etymology of the word "[[civilisation]]") and connected with the actual [[western civilisation]] on which subsequent cultures built.

One main legacy is the [[Latin]] language of ancient Rome, epitomized by the [[Classical Latin]] used in [[Latin literature]], [[historical linguistics|evolved]] during the [[Middle Ages]] and remains in use in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as [[Ecclesiastical Latin]]. [[Vulgar Latin]], the common tongue used for regular social interactions, evolved simultaneously into the various [[Romance languages]] that exist today (notably [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], etc.). Although the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell in the 5th century AD, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] continued until its conquest by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 15th century AD and cemented the [[Greek language]] in many parts of the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] even after the [[Early Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century AD. Although there has been a small modern revival of the [[Hellenistic religion]] with [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenism]], ancient [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman paganism]] was largely [[Early Christianity|displaced by Roman Catholic Christianity]] after the 4th century AD and [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|the Christian conversion]] of [[Roman emperor]] [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] (r. 306-337 AD). The Christian faith of the late Roman Empire continued to evolve [[History of Christianity during the Middle Ages|during the Middle Ages]] and remains a major facet of [[History of modern Christianity|the religion]] and the psyche of the modern [[Western world]].

[[Ancient Roman architecture]], largely indebted to [[ancient Greek architecture]] of the [[Hellenistic period]], has influenced the [[Classical architecture|architecture of the Western world]], particularly during the [[Italian Renaissance]] of the 15th century. [[Roman law]] and [[republic]]an politics (from the age of the [[Roman Republic]]) have left an enduring legacy, influencing the [[Maritime republics|Italian city-state republics]] of the Medieval period as well as the early [[United States]] and other modern [[democratic republic]]s. The [[Julian calendar]] of ancient Rome formed the basis of the standard modern [[Gregorian calendar]], while [[Roman technology|Roman inventions]] and engineering, such as the construction of [[concrete]] [[dome]]s, continued to influence various peoples after the fall of Rome. Roman models of [[colonialism]] and of warfare also became influential.

== Language ==
{{Main|Romance languages|Romance-speaking world}}

[[Latin]] became the [[lingua franca]] of the early Roman Empire and later of the [[Western Roman Empire]], while - particularly in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] - indigenous languages such as [[Greek language|Greek]] and to a lesser degree [[Egyptian language| Egyptian]] and [[Aramaic| Aramaic language]] continued in use. Despite the decline of the Western Roman Empire, the Latin language continued to flourish in the very different social and economic environment of the [[Middle Ages]], not least because it became the official language of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. [[Koine Greek]], which served as a lingua franca in the Eastern Empire, remains in use today as a [[Sacred language#Christianity|sacred language]] in some [[Eastern Orthodox Church | Eastern Orthodox churches]].

In [[Western Europe| Western]] and [[Central Europe]] and in parts of northern [[Africa]], Latin retained its elevated status as the main vehicle of communication for the learned classes throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and subsequently; witness especially the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods. Books which had a revolutionary impact on science, such as [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]' ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (1543), were composed in Latin. This language was not supplanted for scientific purposes until the 18th century, and for formal descriptions in [[zoology]], as well as [[botany]] - it survived to the later 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;See [[History of Latin]].&lt;/ref&gt; The modern international [[binomial nomenclature]] holds to this day: taxonomists assign a [[Scientific name| Latin or Latinized name]] as the scientific name of each [[species]].

In the 21st century the [[Romance languages]], which comprise all languages that descended from [[Latin]], are spoken by more than 920 million people as their [[first language | mother tongue]], and by 300 million people as a [[second language]], mainly in the Americas, Europe, and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/Romance-languages |title= Romance languages |publisher= Britannica.com |date= |accessdate= 2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romance languages are either [[official language | official]], co-official, or significantly used in 72 countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://departamento.pucp.edu.pe/educacion/areas-academicas/curriculo-y-didactica/curriculo-y-didactica-publicaciones/language-acquisition-romance-speaking-world-peru/ |title= Language Acquisition in the Romance Speaking World: Peru - Departamento de Educación |publisher= Departamento.pucp.edu.pe | date= |accessdate= 2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2020}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=zM_mBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%22romance+speaking+world%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22romance%20speaking%20world%22&amp;f=false |title= Manual of Language Acquisition - Google Libros |date= 2014-08-25 |accessdate= 2016-05-14|isbn= 9783110302257 |last1= Fäcke |first1= Christiane }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=June 2020}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=eOUfbeTC-tsC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=romanophone+world#v=onepage&amp;q=romanophone%20world&amp;f=false |title= Multilingualism, Education and Change - Jean Jacques Weber - Google Libros |accessdate= 2016-05-14|isbn= 9783631572856 |last1= Weber |first1= Jean Jacques |year= 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=June 2020}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=_ZmZ21jOH9EC&amp;pg=RA1-PT73&amp;lpg=RA1-PT73&amp;dq=romanophone+world#v=onepage&amp;q=romanophone%20world&amp;f=false |title= Language in the Media: Representations, Identities, Ideologies - Google Libros |date= 2007-09-19 |accessdate= 2016-05-14|isbn= 9781441151254 |last1= Johnson |first1= Sally |last2= Ensslin |first2= Astrid }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=June 2020}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=hprLhm1Xra0C&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=%22neolatin+world%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22neolatin%20world%22&amp;f=false |title= I nomi dei fiumi, dei monti, dei siti: strutture linguistiche preistoriche - Claudio Beretta - Google Libros |accessdate= 2016-05-14|isbn= 9788820330989 |last1= Beretta |first1= Claudio |year= 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=June 2020}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= USA |title= Radiation oncology in Latin speaking countries: A link between Europe and Latin America. |date= 2015-09-28 |pmid= 25061515 |doi= 10.1016/j.rpor.2013.06.004 |volume= 19 |pmc=4104016 |journal= Rep Pract Oncol Radiother |issue= 4 |pages= 227–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=June 2020}} Of the [[United Nations]]' six [[Official languages of the United Nations | official languages]], two (French and Spanish) descend from Latin.

{{Main|Latin alphabet}}
[[File:Latin alphabet world distribution.svg|thumb|300px|Global distribution of the [[Latin script]].]]

All three official scripts of the modern [[European Union]]—[[Latin script| Latin]], [[Greek script |Greek]] and [[Cyrillic script| Cyrillic]]—descend from writing systems used in the Roman Empire. Today, the [[Latin script]], the [[Latin alphabet]] spread by the Roman Empire to most of Europe, and derived from the Phoenician alphabet through an ancient form of the Greek alphabet adopted and modified by Etruscan, is the most widespread and commonly used script in the world. Spread by various colonies, trade routes, and political powers, the script has continued to grow in influence. The Greek alphabet, which had spread throughout the eastern Mediterranean region during the [[Hellenistic period]], remained the primary script of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] through the [[Byzantine Empire]] until its demise in the 15th century. Cyrillic scripts largely derive from the Greek.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Latin literature ===
[[File:Incunabula distribution by language.png|thumb|250px| [[Incunabula|15th-century printed books]] by language.&lt;ref name="ISTC"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/istc/index.html |title= Incunabula Short Title Catalogue | author= |publisher= [[British Library]] |accessdate= 2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high prestige of Latin meant that that language still dominated European published discourse a millennium after the demise of the Western Roman Empire.]]

The [[Carolingian Renaissance]] of the 8th century rescued many works in Latin from oblivion: manuscripts transcribed at that time are our only sources for some works that later fell into obscurity once more, only to be recovered during the [[Renaissance]]: [[Tacitus]], [[Lucretius]], [[Propertius]] and [[Catullus]] furnish examples.&lt;ref&gt;
Roberto Weiss, ''The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity'' (Oxford: Blackwell) 1969:1.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Other Latin writers never went out of circulation: [[Virgil]], reinterpreted as a prophet of Christianity by the 4th century, gained the reputation of a sorcerer in the 12th century.

[[Cicero]], in a limited number of his works, remained a model of good style, mined for quotations. Medieval Christians read [[Ovid]] [[allegory|allegorically]], or re-imagined [[Seneca the Younger |Seneca]] as the correspondent of [[Saint Paul]]. [[Lucan]], [[Persius]], [[Juvenal]], [[Horace]], [[Terence]], and [[Statius]] survived in the continuing [[Western canon| canon]] and the historians [[Valerius Maximus]] and [[Livy]] continued to be read for the moral lessons history was expected to impart.

Through the Roman Empire, Greek literature also continued to make an impact in Europe long after the Empire's fall, especially after the recovery of Greek texts from the East during the high Middle Ages and the resurgence of Greek literacy during the Renaissance. Many educated Westerners from the Renaissance up to the 20th century, for instance, read [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans]]'', originally written in Greek.  Shakespeare's play [[Julius Caesar (play)| ''Julius Caesar'']] takes most of its material from Plutarch's biographies of [[Julius Caesar| Caesar]], [[Cato the Younger|Cato]], and [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]], whose exploits were frequently discussed and debated by the literati of Shakespeare's time.

== Education ==
{{Main|Liberal arts}}

[[Martianus Capella]] developed the system of the seven liberal arts that structured medieval education. Although the liberal arts were already known in [[Ancient Greece]], it was only after Martianus that the seven liberal arts took on canonical form.
His single encyclopedic work, ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii'' "On the Marriage of Philology and Mercury", laid the standard formula of academic learning from the Christianized Roman Empire of the 5th century until the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]].

The seven liberal arts were formed by the [[trivium]], which included the skills of grammar, logic, and rhetoric, while arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy played part as the [[quadrivium]].

== Calendar and measurement  ==
{{Main|Gregorian calendar|Names of the days of the week}}

The modern [[Gregorian calendar|Western calendar]] is a refinement of the [[Julian calendar]], which was introduced by [[Julius Caesar]].  The calendar of the Roman Empire began with the months [[Ianuarius]] (January), [[Februarius]] (February), and [[Martius (month)|Martius]] (March). The common tradition to begin the year on 1 January was a convention established in ancient Rome. Throughout the medieval period, the year began on 25 March, the Catholic Solemnity of the Annunciation.

Roman monk of the 5th-century, [[Dionysius Exiguus]], devised the modern dating system of the [[Anno Domini]] (AD) era, which is based on the reckoned year of the birth of [[Jesus]], with AD counting years from the start of this epoch, and BC denoting years before the start of the era.
 
The modern seven-day week follows the Greco-Roman system of [[planetary hours]], in which one of the seven heavenly bodies of the [[Solar System]] that were known in ancient times—[[Saturn]], [[Jupiter]],  [[Mars]], [[Sun|the Sun]], [[Venus]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Moon|the Moon]]—is given "rulership" over each day. The Romance languages (with the exception of Portuguese, that assigns an ordinal number to five days of the week, from Monday to Friday, beginning with ''{{lang|pt|segunda-feira}}'', and ending with ''{{lang|pt|sexta-feira}}'') preserve the original Latin names of each day of the week, except for Sunday, which came to be called ''{{lang|la|dies dominicus}}'' ([[Lord's Day]]) under Christianity.

This system for the days of the week spread to Celtic and Germanic peoples, as well as the Albanians, before the collapse of the empire, after which the names of comparable gods were substituted for the Roman deities in some languages. In Germanic languages, for instance, [[Thor]] stood in for Jupiter (Jove), yielding "Thursday" from the Latin ''{{lang|la|[[wiktionary:dies Iovis|dies Iovis]]}}'', while in Albanian, native deities [[En (deity)|En]] and [[Prende]] were assigned to Thursday and Friday respectively.

=== Hours of the day ===
{{Main|12-hour clock|Roman timekeeping}}

The 12-hour clock is a time convention popularized by the Romans in which the 24 hours of the day are divided into two periods. The Romans divided the day into 12 equal hours, A.M. (''ante-meridiem'', meaning before midday) and P.M. (''post-meridiem'', meaning past midday). The Romans also started the practice used worldwide today of a new day beginning at midnight.

=== Numerals and units ===
{{Main|Roman numerals|Ancient Roman units of measurement}}
[[File:BadSalzdetfurthBadenburgerStr060529.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A typical [[clock face]] with Roman numerals in {{lang|de|[[Bad Salzdetfurth]]}}, Germany.  The notion of a twelve-hour day dates to the Roman Empire.]]

Roman numerals continued as the primary way of writing numbers in Europe until the 14th century, when they were largely replaced in common usage by [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system|Hindu-Arabic numerals]].  The Roman numeral system continues to be widely used, however, in certain formal and minor contexts, such as on clock faces, coins, in the year of construction on [[cornerstone]] inscriptions, and in generational suffixes (such as [[Louis XIV]] or [[William Howard Taft IV]]). According to the [[Royal Spanish Academy]], in the Spanish language centuries must be written in Roman numerals, so "21st century" should be written as "Siglo XXI".

The Romans solidified the modern concept of the [[hour]] as one-24th part of a day and night.  The [[Imperial and US customary measurement systems|English measurement system]] also retains features of the [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Ancient Roman foot]] (11.65 modern inches), which was used in England prior to the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]]. The [[inch]] itself derives from the Roman {{lang|la|[[wiktionary:uncia|uncia]]}}, meaning one-twelfth part.

=== Three-age systems ===
{{Main|Three-age system}}
Although the present archaeological system of the three main ages—stone, bronze and iron—originates with the Danish archaeologist [[Christian Jürgensen Thomsen]], the concept of dividing pre-historical ages into systems based on metals extends to Ancient Rome, originated by the Roman [[Lucretius]] in the first century BC.

== Religion ==
[[File:Percent of Christians by Country–Pew Research 2011.svg|thumb|300px|[[Christianity]] by percentage of population in each country.]]
{{Main|Catholic Church|Eastern Orthodox Church}}

While classical [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Hellenistic religion]] were ultimately superseded by Christianity, many key theological ideas and questions that are characteristic of [[Western religions]] originated with pre-Christian theology.  The [[Cosmological argument|first cause]] argument for the existence of God, for instance, originates with Plato. [[Teleological argument|Design arguments]], which were introduced by Socrates and Aristotle and remain widely discussed to this day, formed an influential component of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] theology well into the late Roman period.  The [[problem of evil]] was widely discussed among ancient philosophers, including the Roman writers such as [[De Natura Deorum|Cicero]] and [[De Providentia|Seneca]], and many of the answers they provided were later absorbed into Christian [[theodicy]]. In Christian moral theology, moreover, the field of [[Natural law|natural law ethics]] draws heavily on the tradition established by Aristotle, the Stoics, and especially by Cicero's popular Latin work, [[De Legibus]].  Cicero's conception of natural law "found its way to later centuries notably through the writings of [[Isidore of Seville|Saint Isidore of Seville]] and the [[Decretum Gratiani|Decretum of Gratian]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward S.|last=Corwin|title=The "Higher Law" Background of American Constitutional Law|url=https://archive.org/details/higherlawbackgro0000corw|url-access=registration|location=Ithaca, NY|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1955|pages=[https://archive.org/details/higherlawbackgro0000corw/page/17 17–18]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influenced the discussion of the topic up through the era of the American Revolution.

Christianity itself also spread through the Roman Empire; since emperor [[Theodosius I]] (AD 379-395), the official [[state church of the Roman Empire]] was [[Christianity]]. Subsequently, former Roman territories became Christian states which exported their religion to other parts of the world, through colonization and missionaries.

Christianity also served as a conduit for preserving and transmitting Greco-Roman literary culture. Classical educational tradition in the [[liberal arts]] was preserved after the fall of the empire by the [[Medieval university|medieval Christian university]]. Education in the Middle Ages relied heavily on Greco-Roman books such as Euclid's ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' and the influential [[quadrivium]] textbooks written in Latin by the Roman statesman [[Boethius]] (AD 480–524).

Major works of Greek and Latin literature, moreover, were both read and written by Christians during the imperial era. Many of the most influential works of the early Christian tradition were written by Roman and [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] theologians who engaged heavily with the literary culture of the empire (see [[church fathers]]).  [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]'s (AD 354-430) ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]],'' for instance, draws extensively on [[Virgil]], [[Cicero]], [[Varro]], [[Homer]], [[Plato]], and elements of Roman values and identity to criticize paganism and advocate for Christianity amidst a crumbling empire.  The engagement of early Christians as both readers and writers of important Roman and Greek literature helped to ensure that the literary culture of Rome would persist after the fall of the empire.  For thousands of years to follow, religious scholars in the Latin West from [[Bede]] to [[Thomas Aquinas]] and later renaissance figures such as [[Dante]], [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] and [[Shakespeare]] would continue to read, reference and imitate both Christian and pagan literature from the Roman Empire.  In the east, the empire's prolific tradition of Greek literature continued uninterrupted after the fall of the west, in part due to the works of the [[Church Fathers|Greek fathers]], who were widely read by Christians in medieval Byzantium and continue to influence religious thought to this day (see [[Byzantine literature]]).

== Science and philosophy ==
{{Main|Roman philosophy|Ancient Greek philosophy|}}

[[File:Cellarius Harmonia Macrocosmica - Theoria Lunae.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Ptolemy's refined geocentric theory of [[Deferent and epicycle|epicycles]] was backed up by rigorous mathematics and detailed astronomical observations. It was not overturned until the [[Copernican Revolution]], over a thousand years later.]]

While much of the most influential [[History of science in classical antiquity|Greek science]] and [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophy]] was developed before the rise of the Empire, major innovations occurred under Roman rule that have had a lasting impact on the intellectual world.  The traditions of Greek, Egyptian and Babylonian scholarship continued to flourish at great centers of learning such as [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], [[Musaeum|Alexandria]], and [[Pergamon]].

[[Epicurean]] philosophy reached a literary apex in the long poem by [[Lucretius]], who advocated an atomic theory of matter and revered the older teachings of the Greek [[Democritus]].  The works of the philosophers [[Seneca the Younger]], [[Epictetus]] and the Roman emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] were widely read during the revival of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] thought in the [[Neostoicism|Renaissance]], which synthesized Stoicism and Christianity.  Fighter pilot [[James Stockdale]] famously credited the philosophy of [[Epictetus]] as being a major source of strength when he was shot down and held as prisoner during the [[Vietnam War]].  Plato's philosophy continued to be widely studied under the Empire, growing into the sophisticated [[neoplatonism|neoplatonic]] system through the influence of [[Plotinus]].  Platonic philosophy was largely reconciled with Christianity by the Roman theologian [[Augustine of Hippo]], who, while a staunch opponent of Roman paganism, viewed the Platonists as having more in common with Christians than the other pagan schools.&lt;ref&gt;Agustine, ''De Civitate Dei,'' book viii.&lt;/ref&gt;  To this day, Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' is considered the foundational work of Western philosophy, and is read by students around the globe.

The widespread [[Lorem ipsum]] text, which is widely used as a meaningless placeholder in modern typography and graphic design, is derived from the Latin text of Cicero's philosophical treatise ''[[De finibus bonorum et malorum|De finibus]].''

Pagan philosophy was gradually supplanted by Christianity in the later years of the Empire, culminating in the closure of the [[Platonic Academy|Academy of Athens]] by [[Justinian I]].  Many Greek-speaking philosophers moved to the east, outside the borders of the Empire.  Neoplatonism and Aristotelianism gained a stronghold in Persia, where they were a heavy influence on early [[Islamic philosophy]].  Thinkers of the [[Islamic Golden Age]] such as [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina (Avicenna)]] and [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd (Averroës)]] engaged deeply with Greek philosophy, and played a major role in saving works of Aristotle that had been lost to the Latin West.  The influence of Greek philosophy on Islam was dramatically reduced In the 11th century when the views of Avicenna and Avveroes were strongly criticized by [[Al-Ghazali]].  His ''[[Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'' is among the most influential books in Islamic history.  In Western Europe, meanwhile, the recovery of Greek texts during the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic period]] had a profound influence on Latin science and theology from the Middle Ages into the Renaissance.

In science, the theories of the Greco-Roman physician [[Galen]] dominated Western medical thought and practice for more than 1,300 years.  [[Ptolemy]] produced the most thorough and sophisticated astronomical theory of antiquity, documented in the [[Almagest]].  The [[Geocentric Model#Ptolemaic Model|Ptolemaic model]] of the solar system would remain the dominant approach to astronomy across Europe and the Middle East for more than a thousand years. Forty eight of the 88 constellations the [[IAU]] recognizes today were recorded in the seventh and eighth books of Claudius Ptolemy's Almagest.

At Alexandria, the engineer and experimentalist [[Hero of Alexandria]] founded the study of [[mechanics]] and [[pneumatics]]. In modern geometry, [[Heron's formula]] bears his name.  Roman Alexandria also saw the seeds of modern algebra arise in the works of [[Diophantus]].  Greek algebra continued to be studied in the east well after the fall of the Western Empire, where it matured into modern algebra in the hands of [[al-Khwārizmī]] (see the [[history of algebra]]).  The study of [[Diophantine Equations]] and [[Diophantine Approximation]]s are still important areas of mathematical research today.

All of the planets in the [[Solar System]], excluding [[Earth]] and [[Uranus]], are named after [[Roman deities]].

Although the law of the Roman Empire is not used today, modern law in many jurisdictions is based on principles of law used and developed during the Roman Empire. Some of the same Latin [[List of legal Latin terms|terminology]] is still used today. The general structure of jurisprudence used today, in many jurisdictions, is the same (trial with a judge, plaintiff, and defendant) as that established during the Roman Empire.

The modern concept of [[Republic|republican government]] is directly modeled on the [[Roman Republic]].  The republican institutions of Rome survived in many of the [[Italian city-states]] of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.  The [[United States Congress]] is inspired by the [[Roman senate]] and [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic|legislative assemblies]], while the president holds a position similar to that of a [[Roman consul]].  Many European political thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] were avid consumers of Latin literature.  [[Montesquieu]], [[Edmund Burke]], and [[John Adams]] were all strongly influenced by [[Cicero]], for instance.  Adams recommended Cicero as a model for politicians to imitate, and once remarked that "the sweetness and grandeur of his sounds, and the harmony of his numbers give pleasure enough to reward the reading if one understood none of his meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Richard, ''Why We're All Romans: The Roman Contribution to the Western World,'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2010, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inventions ==
{{Main|Roman technology|Eastern Roman technology}}
[[File:Gnocchi di ricotta burro e salvia.jpg|thumb|[[Gnocchi]], a kind of traditional Italian pasta, was introduced to various parts of Europe by the [[Roman legion]]s during the expansion of the empire.]]

Many Roman inventions were improved versions of other people's inventions and ranged from military organization, weapon improvements, [[armour]], [[siege]] technology, naval innovation, architecture, medical instruments, irrigation, civil planning, construction, [[agriculture]] and many more areas of civic, governmental, military and [[engineering]] development.

That said, the Romans also developed a huge array of new technologies and innovations. Many came from common themes but were vastly superior to what had come before, whilst others were totally new inventions developed by and for the needs of Empire and the Roman way of life.

Some of the more famous examples are the [[Roman aqueduct]]s (some of which are still in use today), [[Roman roads]], water powered milling machines, thermal heating systems (as employed in [[Thermae|Roman baths]], and also used in palaces and wealthy homes) sewage and pipe systems and the invention and widespread use of [[concrete]].

Metallurgy and glass work (including the first widespread use of glass windows) and a wealth of architectural innovations including high rise buildings, dome construction, bridgeworks and floor construction (seen in the functionality of the [[Colosseum]]'s arena and the underlying rooms/areas beneath it) are other examples of Roman innovation and genius.

Military inventiveness was widespread and ranged from tactical/strategic innovations, new methodologies in training, discipline and field medicine as well as inventions in all aspects of weaponry, from armor and shielding to siege engines and missile technology.

This combination of new methodologies, technical innovation, and creative invention in the military gave Rome the edge against its adversaries for half a millennium, and with it, the ability to create an empire that even today, more than 2000 years later, continues to leave its legacy in many areas of modern life.

== Colonies and roads ==
{{Main|List of cities founded by the Romans}}

Rome left a legacy of founding many cities as ''[[Colonia (Roman)|Colonia]]''. There were more than 500 Roman colonies spread through the Empire, most of them populated by veterans of the Roman legions. Some Roman colonies rose to become influential commercial and trade centers, transportation hubs and capitals of international empires, like [[Constantinople]], [[London]], [[Paris]] and [[Vienna]].

All those colonies were connected by another important legacy of the Roman Empire: the [[Roman roads]]. Indeed, the empire comprised more than {{convert|400,000|km}} of roads, of which over {{convert|80,500|km}} were stone-paved.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel, Richard A. ''The Great Armies of Antiquity''. Westport, Conn: Praeger, 2002. [https://books.google.com/books?id=y1ngxn_xTOIC&amp;pg=PA9 Page 9].&lt;/ref&gt; The courses (and sometimes the surfaces) of many Roman roads survived for millennia and many are overlaid by modern roads, like the [[Via Emilia]] in northern Italy. The roads are closely linked to modern-day economies, with those that survived from the empire's territorial peak in 117CE having more economic activity today. This is especially true in European areas, which kept wheeled vehicles in the latter half of the first millennium, whereas other regions preferred cheaper methods of transport such as [[camel caravan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article | authors = Dalgaard, Carl-Johan and Kaarsen, Nicolai and Olsson, Ola and Selaya, Pablo | title = Roman Roads to Prosperity: Persistence and Non-Persistence of Public Goods Provision | year = 2018 | publisher = Center for Economic and Policy Research| ssrn = 3130184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
{{Main|Ancient Roman architecture}}
[[File:Wilno Katedra.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Cathedral of Vilnius]] (1783), by [[Laurynas Gucevičius]].]]

In the mid-18th century, Roman architecture inspired [[neoclassical architecture]]. Neoclassicism was an international movement. Though neoclassical architecture employs the same classical vocabulary as late [[Baroque architecture]], it tends to emphasize its planar qualities, rather than sculptural volumes. Projections and recessions and their effects of [[Chiaroscuro|light, and shade]] are flatters; sculptural bas-reliefs are flatter and tend to be enframed in friezes, tablets or panels. Its clearly articulated individual features are isolated rather than interpenetrating, autonomous and complete in themselves.

International neoclassical architecture was exemplified in [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]'s buildings, especially the [[Altes Museum|Old Museum]] in Berlin, Sir [[John Soane]]'s Bank of England in London and the newly built [[White House]] and [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] in [[Washington, DC]] in the [[United States]]. The Scots architect [[Charles Cameron (architect)|Charles Cameron]] created palatial Italianate interiors for the German-born [[Catherine II the Great]] in [[St. Petersburg]].

Italy clung to Rococo until the Napoleonic regimes brought the new archaeological classicism, which was embraced as a political statement by young, progressive, urban Italians with republican leanings.

== Imperial idea ==
{{See also|Translatio imperii}}
[[File:Palaeologoi eagle.jpg|thumb|250px|Coat of arms of the [[Palaiologoi]], the last imperial dynasty of the Eastern Roman Empire.]]

From a legal point of view the Roman Empire, founded by [[Augustus]] in 27 BC and divided into two "parts" (or rather, courts, as the empire continued to be considered as one) after the death of [[Theodosius I]] in 395, had survived only in the eastern part which, with the deposition of the last western emperor [[Romulus Augustulus]], in 476, had also obtained the imperial regalia of the western part reuniting from a formal point of view the Roman Empire.

The Roman line continued uninterrupted to rule the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], whose main characteristics were Roman concept of state, medieval Greek culture and language, and [[Orthodox Christian]] faith. The Byzantines themselves never ceased to refer to themselves as "Romans" (''Rhomaioi'') and to their state as the "Roman Empire", the "Empire of the Romans" (in Greek Βασιλεία των Ῥωμαίων, Basileía ton Rhōmaíōn) or "Romania" (Ῥωμανία, Rhōmanía). Likewise, they were called "[[Rûm]]" (Rome) by their eastern enemies to the point that competing neighbours even acquired its name, such as the [[Sultanate of Rûm]].

[[File:German - Flask for Priming Power with the Justice of Trajan - Walters 511334.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.25|''Flask for Priming Power with the Justice of Trajan'' (mid-16th century), depicting a woman's plea for justice from [[Trajan]], with an imperial pennant of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] suggesting that as Holy Roman Emperors they are the political descendants of the ancient Roman emperors ''([[Walters Art Museum]])'']]

The designation of the Empire as "Byzantine" is a retrospective idea: it began only in 1557, a century after the [[fall of Constantinople]], when [[Germans|German]] historian [[Hieronymus Wolf]] published his work ''Corpus Historiæ Byzantinæ'', a collection of Byzantine sources. The term did not come in general use in the [[Western world]] before the 19th century,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} when modern [[Greece]] was born. The end of the ''continuous'' tradition of the Roman Empire is open to debate: the final point was the [[capture of Constantinople]] in 1453 AD, while some place it at the [[Siege of Constantinople (1203)|sack of Constantinople]] by the [[Crusades|crusaders]] in 1204.

After the fall of Constantinople, [[Thomas Palaiologos]], brother of the last [[Eastern Roman Emperor]], [[Constantine XI]],  was elected emperor and tried to organize the remaining forces. His rule came to an end after the fall of the last major Byzantine city, Corinth. He then moved to Italy and continued to be recognized as Eastern emperor by the Christian powers.

His son [[Andreas Palaiologos]] continued claims on the Byzantine throne until he sold the title to [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand of Aragon]] and [[Isabella of Castile]] before his death in 1502.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich, John Julius, ''Byzantium — The Decline and Fall'', p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence that any Spanish monarch used the Byzantine imperial titles, which would have symbolically converted the [[king of Spain]] into a legitimate Emperor of Rome.

In [[Western Europe]], the Roman concept of state was continued for almost a millennium by the [[Holy Roman Empire]] whose emperors, mostly of [[German language|German]] tongue, viewed themselves as the legitimate successors to the ancient imperial tradition (''[[King of the Romans]]'') and Rome as the capital of its Empire. The German title of "[[Kaiser]]" is derived from the Latin name ''Caesar'', which is pronounced {{IPA-la|ˈkae̯sar|}} in Classical Latin.

The coronation of [[Charlemagne]] as "Roman" emperor by [[Pope Leo III]] in the year 800 was a deprived act of legitimate juridical profile: only the Roman emperor of the East (called "Byzantine" later by the Enlightenment in the eighteenth century) would be crowned a peer of him in the western part, which is why Constantinople was always suspicious of that act.

The emperors of the Holy Roman Empire sought in many ways to make themselves accepted by the Byzantines as their peers: with diplomatic relations, political marriages or threats. Sometimes, however, they did not obtain the expected results, because from Constantinople they were always called "King of the Germans", never "Emperor." The Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1806 owing to pressure by [[Napoleon I]].

In [[Eastern Europe]], firstly the [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]], then the [[Emperor of the Serbs|Serbian]] and ultimately the Russian [[czar]]s (''Czar'' derived from [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]) proclaimed being Emperors. In [[Moscow]] in [[Russia]] adopted the idea of being a [[Third Rome]] (with Constantinople being the second).
