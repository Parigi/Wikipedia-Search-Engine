'''Apple TV''' is a [[digital media player]] and [[microconsole]] developed and sold by [[Apple Inc.]] It is a small [[networking hardware|network appliance]] and entertainment device that can receive digital data for visual and audio content such as music, video, video games, or the screen display of certain other devices, and play it on a connected [[television set]] or other video display.

Apple TV is an [[HDMI]]-compliant source device.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To use it for viewing, it has to be connected to an [[enhanced-definition television|enhanced-definition]] or [[high-definition television|high-definition]] [[widescreen]] television via an HDMI cable. The device has no integrated controls and can only be controlled remotely, either by an [[Apple Remote]] or [[Siri Remote]] control device (which is included with Apple TV) using its infrared/Bluetooth capability, by the [[Remote (Apple software)|Apple TV Remote app]] (downloadable from [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]) on numerous Apple devices using its [[Wi-Fi]] capability, or by some third-party gaming controllers and [[remote control|infrared remotes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple TV: Can I program my universal remote to work with Apple TV |url=https://www.apple.com/shop/question/answers/readonly/tag/appletv/can-i-program-my-universal-remote-to-work-with-apple-tv/QFPXHYX7XY9HCCFYC |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |accessdate=24 August 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Can the Apple TV bring everything under (remote) control? |url=https://www.macworld.com/article/3011167/home-players/how-to-use-any-remote-control-with-your-apple-tv.html |website=[[Macworld]] |accessdate=24 August 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple TV runs [[software application]]s preinstalled with the system software or, for models running [[tvOS]], downloaded from Apple's [[App Store (tvOS)|tvOS App Store]] over the device's Wi-Fi connection, with the most popular being those that stream video.&lt;ref name="AppleRefocus5" /&gt; Major online content sources for Apple TV apps include subscription services for [[streaming television]] and film, cable and broadcast networks via [[TV Everywhere]], and major [[sports league]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Its Wi-Fi capability is also used to receive content purchased or rented directly from Apple's [[ITunes Store]], transmitted from other nearby [[iDevice|iDevices]] via [[AirPlay]], or shared from [[macOS]] or [[Windows]] computers running [[ITunes]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

According to observers, Apple's [[list of Apple Inc. media events#Apple Special Event (March 25, 2019)|March 2019 special event]] highlighted the company's reorientation of its focus away from the Apple TV hardware, which has lagged competitors with only 13% of U.S. connected TV market share, and apps on the [[set-top box]], and toward higher revenue Apple-distributed video streaming that will be available even through competitors' devices, via the company's [[Apple TV+]] original content service and [[Apple TV Channels]] [[A la carte pay television|a la carte]] premium [[video on demand]] subscription aggregating service.&lt;ref name="AppleRefocus1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/commentary/367380/apple-tv-is-the-death-of-apple-tv |title=Apple TV Is the Death of Apple TV |last=Greenwald |first=Will |website=[[PCMag.com]] |date=March 26, 2019 |access-date=March 26, 2019|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AppleRefocus2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.fiercevideo.com/video/editor-s-corner-apple-tv-will-die-so-tv-can-live |title=Apple TV will die so TV+ can live |last=Munson |first=Ben |website=FierceVideo |date=March 26, 2019 |access-date=March 26, 2019|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AppleRefocus3"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/26/apple-tvs-biggest-news-isnt-about-content-its-about-screens-you-can-watch-anywhere/ |title=Apple TVâ€™s biggest news isnâ€™t about content, itâ€™s about screens â€” you can watch anywhere |last=Lawrence |first=Dallas |website=[[VentureBeat]] |date=March 26, 2019 |access-date=March 26, 2019|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AppleRefocus4"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/3-ways-the-new-apple-tv-services-will-make-cord-cutting-better/ |title=3 ways the new Apple TV services will make cord cutting better |last=Hiner |first=Jason |website=[[Cnet.com]] |date=March 25, 2019 |access-date=March 26, 2019|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AppleRefocus5"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fortune.com/2019/03/24/watch-apple-event-live-stream-television-news-service/ |last=Pullen |first=John Patrick |title=Apple's Two-Word Plan for the Future of the Internet: Subscribe Now |website=[[Forbes.com]] |date=March 24, 2019 |access-date=March 25, 2019|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AppleRefocus6"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-apple-video-service-20190325-story.html |last1=Lee |first1=Wendy |last2=Faughnder |first2=Ryan |title=Apple unveils ambitious new video service intended to take on Netflix |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 25, 2019 |access-date=March 25, 2019|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AppleRefocus7"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/03/25/apple-event-unveils-new-premium-news-and-streaming-services/3249329002/ |title=Apple goes big on premium services: Apple TV+ streaming, News+, Arcade and new credit card |last=Baig |first=Edward C. |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=March 25, 2019 |access-date=March 25, 2019|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AppleRefocus8"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/25/apple-tv-channels/ |last=Hardawar |first=Devindra |title=Apple TV Channels is an a la carte way to watch your favorite networks |website=[[Engadget]] |date=March 25, 2019 |access-date=March 25, 2019|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AppleRefocus9"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/apple-tv-streaming-service-1203171335/ |title=Apple Reveals New TV Streaming Service | last=Holloway |first=Daniel |date=March 25, 2019 |access-date=March 26, 2019 |website=[[Variety.com]]|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In an early attempt to enter the home entertainment industry, Apple released the [[Macintosh TV]] in 1993. Macintosh TV had a 14-inch [[cathode-ray tube|CRT]] [[computer monitor|screen]] along with a [[TV tuner card]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= When Apple flops: The worst Apple products of all time |url= https://www.networkworld.com/article/2236724/data-center/when-apple-flops--the-worst-apple-products-of-all-time.html |website= Network World |accessdate= 12 August 2018 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This did not prove to be a success, as only 10,000 units of Macintosh TV were sold up to its discontinuation in 1994.&lt;ref name="appgragh"&gt;{{cite web |title= Apple TV: The history of Apple's bid to take over your living room |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/11849521/Apple-TV-The-story-of-Apples-bid-to-take-over-your-living-room.html |website=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate= 12 August 2018 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's next foray into the television industry came with the [[Apple Interactive Television Box]], also in 1994. Apple Interactive Television Box was a collaboration venture between Apple, [[British Telecom|BT]], and [[Belgacom]] but it never went on sale to the public.&lt;ref name="appgragh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Apple TV Prototype Sells on eBay for 46 Bucks |url= https://www.wired.com/2010/05/apple-tv-prototype-sells-on-ebay-for-46-bucks/ |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate= 12 August 2018 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's last major attempt to enter the home entertainment market before Apple TV occurred with their launch of [[Apple Bandai Pippin]] based on the [[Apple Pippin]] platform in the late 1990s. Apple Bandai Pippin combines a [[home game console]] with a networked computer.&lt;ref name="appgragh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=When Apple Failed |url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/29/apple-product-flops-tech-personal-cx_ag_1030apple.html |website=[[Forbes]] |publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=12 August 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting as early as 2011, [[Gene Munster]], longtime [[investment banking]] [[financial analyst|analyst]] at [[Piper Jaffray]] covering Apple, regularly shared rumors that Apple would announce [[HDTV]] [[television set]] hardware to directly compete with [[Sony]], [[LG]], [[Samsung]], and other [[TV]] makers,&lt;ref name=plandvr/&gt; but Apple has never released such a product and Munster finally relented and recanted in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://9to5mac.com/2016/12/15/gene-munster-leaving-piper-jaffray/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.businessinsider.com/gene-munster-throws-in-the-towel-2015-5?r=US&lt;/ref&gt; This was despite the set being mentioned as a possibility for a future breakthrough product in [[Steve Jobs]]' [[biography]] [[Steve Jobs (book)|''Steve Jobs'']].&lt;ref name="appgragh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]]'' (2011, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], {{ISBN|978-1451648539}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/briancaulfield/2011/10/21/steve-jobs-on-tv-i-finally-cracked-it/#1814a65150be&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/8983363/Apple-plans-37-inch-TV-for-2012.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple TV was unveiled as a work in progress called '''"iTV"''' on September 12, 2006 at an [[List of Apple Inc. media events#Apple Special Event (September 12, 2006)|Apple Special Event]] using a modified [[Front Row (software)|Front Row]] interface using the [[Apple Remote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Cohen |first= Peter |title= Apple 'It's Showtime!' event |work=[[MacWorld]] |date= September 12, 2006 |url= https://www.macworld.com/article/52855/2006/09/showtime.html |accessdate= September 13, 2006 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Eran |first= Daniel |title= How Apple's iTV Media Strategy Works |work= RoughlyDrafted Magazine |date= September 13, 2006 |url= http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/21133BEF-61B4-40C1-A976-5C1360E60694.html |accessdate= June 19, 2009 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple started taking pre-orders for Apple TV on January 9, 2007. The name "iTV" was originally going to be used to keep the product in line with the rest of their "i"-based products (iMac, iPod, etc.), but was not used because the British terrestrial broadcast network [[ITV Network|ITV]] holds the rights to the name in the UK and threatened to take legal action against Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/9076502/ITV-warns-Apple-not-to-brand-smart-television-iTV.html |title= ITV warns Apple not to brand smart television 'iTV' |accessdate= February 22, 2015 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 15, 2008, a software upgrade was announced; this turned the Apple TV into a stand-alone device which removed the requirement for a computer running iTunes on Mac OS X or Windows to stream or sync content to it, and making most of the Apple TV's hard disk redundant. The update allowed the iTunes Store content to be directly rented and purchased, as well as photo streaming and podcast downloads from [[MobileMe]] (which was called [[.Mac]] at the time) and [[Flickr]].&lt;ref name="SWUpdates"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3187 |title=Apple TV: About Apple TV software updates |date=November 19, 2008 |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=November 20, 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081205100216/http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3187|archivedate=December 5, 2008|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Front Row became deprecated, and a new interface was introduced for the original Apple TV in which content was organized into six categories, all of which appeared in a large square box on the screen upon startup (movies, TV shows, music, [[YouTube]], podcasts, and photos) and presented in the initial menu, along with a "Settings" option for configuration, including software updates.&lt;ref name="MacNN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macnn.com/articles/08/02/12/apple.tv.gallery|title=Gallery: Apple TV Take 2 software update|date=February 12, 2008|publisher=MacNN|accessdate=March 12, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1600|title=How to update Apple TV software|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=September 2, 2008|accessdate=March 12, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 10, 2008, Apple released the [[iTunes Remote]] app on the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.engadget.com/2008/07/10/apples-remote-control-application-for-itunes-and-apple-tv/|title=Apple's Remote: turns your iPhone into a WiFi remote control|first=Thomas|last=Ricker|work=[[Engadget]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=July 10, 2008|accessdate=July 14, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Apple TV 2.1 software update that added recognition for the [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]] as remote control devices intended as a software alternative to the Apple Remote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/07/10/apple-tv-2-1-update-goes-live-adds-mobileme-support/|title=Apple TV 2.1 update goes live, adds MobileMe support|first=Cory|last=Bohon|website=[[Engadget]]|date=July 10, 2008|accessdate=August 21, 2019|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later updates to the Apple TV, iTunes, and Remote software added support for the [[iPad]], and introduced support for new features as they were added to iTunes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

In July 2011, Apple discontinued the Front Row interface for Mac users.&lt;ref name="front_row_mac_discontinued_2011"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.macworld.com/article/1161284/farewell_frontrow.html|title=Farewell Front Row|last=Breen|first=Christopher|date=July 22, 2011 |website=[[Macworld]]|publisher=[[International Data Group]]|access-date=September 19, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2nd generation===
The 2nd generation Apple TV was announced on September 1, 2010, and was the first to run on a variant of [[iOS]].&lt;ref name="newappletv"&gt;{{Cite news |title= Overhauled Apple TV unveiled |work= The Spy Report |publisher= Media Spy |date= September 2, 2010 |url= http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/09/02/overhauled-apple-tv-unveiled |accessdate= September 8, 2010 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120313133403/http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/09/02/overhauled-apple-tv-unveiled/ |archivedate= March 13, 2012 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newappletv1"&gt;{{Cite news |title= From Apple, a Step Into Social Media for Music |work=[[The New York Times]] |first= Miguel |last= Helft |date= September 1, 2010 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/02/technology/02apple.html |accessdate= September 8, 2010 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100902034655/http://www.nytimes.com//2010//09//02//technology//02apple.html |archivedate= September 2, 2010 |url-status= live |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newappletv2"&gt;{{Cite news |title= Apple Goes 'Wild' Over New iPods |publisher=[[ABC News]] |first= Ki Mae |last= Heussner |date= September 1, 2010 |url= https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/apples-ipods-unveiled-ceo-steve-jobs/story?id=11534551 |accessdate= September 8, 2010 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100904133427/http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/apples-ipods-unveiled-ceo-steve-jobs/story?id=11534551 |archivedate= September 4, 2010 |url-status= live |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The device is housed in a smaller, all-black case, one-quarter the size of the original. This model replaced the internal [[hard drive]] with 8&amp;nbsp;GB internal flash storage, enough local storage for buffering purposes; all media became streamed, instead of synced. It supports output up to [[720p]] over [[HDMI]] only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://support.apple.com/kb/SP598?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US |title=Apple TV (2nd generation) - Technical Specifications |date=24 Feb 2017 |accessdate=14 September 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Apple-TV-2nd-Generation-Teardown/3625/2 |title= Apple TV 2nd Generation Teardown&amp;nbsp;â€” Page 2 |publisher=[[iFixit]] |accessdate= March 28, 2012 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 the [[YouTube]] app was removed due to an [[API]] change by [[Google]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://9to5mac.com/2015/05/04/apple-pulls-youtube-from-older-2nd-gen-apple-tvs-after-planned-google-api-change/ Apple pulls YouTube from older 2nd-gen Apple TVs after planned Google API change].

===3rd generation===
On March 7, 2012 Apple announced the 3rd generation Apple TV (model A1427) at [[List of Apple Inc. media events#Apple Special Event (March 7, 2012)|an Apple Special Event]]. It is identical externally to the second generation model, includes a single-core [[Apple A5|A5]] processor, and supports [[1080p]] output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Apple |url= https://www.apple.com/appletv/specs.html |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130809061434/http://www.apple.com/appletv/specs.html |archivedate= August 9, 2013 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple silently released a third generation "Rev A" (model A1469) on January 28, 2013 with component changes included.  This refreshed model gained support for peer to peer Airplay which allowed iOS devices to mirror to the Apple TV without requiring both devices to be on the same WiFi network.  This model also saw the dual core Apple A5 chip with one core deactivated being replaced with a single core variant of the A5 chip.  Some users reported the Rev A drawing less power than the original 3rd generation Apple TV. By October 2016, Apple had phased out the Apple TV third generation, with Apple Store employees instructed to pull all units and demo units from store shelves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Apple discontinues third-gen Apple TV, removes it from online store |url= https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/04/apple-tv-third-gen-discontinued/ |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amazon Video]] was added with Software 7.2.2 released on December 6, 2017.&lt;ref name=amazonvideo /&gt; The [[Apple TV (software)|TV app]] was added with Software 7.3 released on May 13, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[https://9to5mac.com/2019/05/13/ios-12-3-features-tvos-13-more/ iOS 12.3 and tvOS 12.3 now available with new TV app]&lt;/ref&gt;

===4th generation (HD)===
On September 9, 2015, Apple announced the 4th generation Apple TV at [[list of Apple Inc. media events#Apple Special Event (September 9, 2015)|an Apple Special Event]]. The 4th generation model uses a new operating system, [[tvOS]], with an [[app store]], allowing downloads of third-party apps for video, audio, games and other content. Upon release, third-party apps were available from a limited range of providers, with new [[API]]s providing opportunities for more apps. A requirement of new apps and games was that they must include interfacing with the new touchpad-enabled Siri remote, which was later relaxed for games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Apple TV game developers are required to support the Siri remote|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/09/16/apple-tv-siri-remote-required-for-games/|website=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=September 16, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.idownloadblog.com/2016/06/14/tvos-10-games-no-siri-remote/ Apple TV games are no longer required to support Siri Remote]. iDOwnloadBlog.

The 4th generation includes a 64-bit [[Apple A8]] processor, and adds support for [[Dolby Digital Plus]] audio. While similar to the form factor of the 2nd and 3rd generation models, the 4th generation model is taller. In contrast to the old remote's arrow button, the 4th generation Apple TV's touch remote uses swipe-to-select features, [[Siri]] support, a built-in microphone, volume control over HDMI [[Consumer Electronics Control|CEC]] and [[Consumer IR|IR]], and an [[accelerometer]] ([[Inertial measurement unit|IMU]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gil |first1=Lory |title=Siri Remote for Apple TV: The ultimate guide |url=https://www.imore.com/siri-remote |website=iMore |accessdate=3 December 2019 |language=en |date=3 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th generation Apple TV started shipping in October 2015. Upon launch, there were several unexpected issues such as incompatibility with [[Remote (Apple software)|Apple's own Remote]] app for iOS and [[watchOS]].&lt;ref name="AI remote info 1"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://appleinsider.com/articles/15/10/30/new-apple-tv-incompatible-with-apples-own-remote-app-for-ios-and-watchos|title=New Apple TV incompatible with Apple's own Remote app for iOS and watchOS|first=Mikey|last=Campbell|date=October 30, 2015|accessdate=January 12, 2016 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These issues were fixed by Apple on December 8, 2015 in tvOS 9.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.macrumors.com/2015/12/08/apple-tv-remote-support-new-apple-tv/|title=Apple Remote App for iOS Now Works With New Apple TV Following tvOS 9.1 Update|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 13, 2016, Apple released [[tvOS 10]], bringing an all new remote app, single-sign on, [[dark mode]], [[HomeKit]] support, and other features.

===5th generation (4K)===
At [[List of Apple Inc. media events#Apple Special Event (September 12, 2017)|an Apple Special Event]] on September 12, 2017, Apple announced the 5th generation Apple TV, named Apple TV 4K, which supports [[4K resolution|2160p]] output, [[high-dynamic-range video|HDR10]], [[Dolby Vision]], and includes a faster [[Apple A10X Fusion]] processor supporting [[High Efficiency Video Coding|HEVC]] hardware decoding.

Apple. September 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Externally it is similar to the 4th generation model, with the only differences being the addition of vents on the base, the removal of the [[USB-C]] port, and the addition of a white outline around the menu button on the included [[Siri Remote]].

==Features==
Apple TV allows consumers to use an [[HDTV]] to stream video, music, and podcasts as well as downloading apps and games from the tvOS App Store. The first, second, and third generations offered limited content which Apple had provisioned to work with Apple TV. These have now been discontinued&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/04/apple-tv-third-gen-discontinued/ |title=Apple discontinues third-gen Apple TV, removes it from online store |work=[[9to5Mac]] |access-date=October 8, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of the fourth generation Apple TV, with an OS based on [[iOS]] called tvOS which lets developers create their own apps with their own interface that run on Apple TV. These include multimedia, music apps, and games.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

=== App Store ===
*With the fourth generation Apple TV and tvOS, Apple announced an App Store which allows any developer to make apps using the APIs available specifically tailored towards the TV.&lt;ref name="api_4_gen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2015/10/03/tim-cook-apple-tv-universal-search/ |title=Tim Cook: Apple will offer an Apple TV API to open up universal search beyond initial launch partners |last=Mayo |first=Benjamin |date=October 3, 2015|work=[[9to5Mac]]|access-date=September 26, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, since tvOS is based on iOS, any developer can port over apps from iOS and with a few modifications, as Apple stated on stage, and can make them available for all tvOS users with the App Store. The App Store is not available to previous Apple TVs and is a feature of the fourth generation Apple TV onward.

Since tvOS and [[watchOS]] are based on iOS, they have inherited many of the accessibility features of [[iOS]] and [[macOS]]&lt;ref name="apple_accessiblity_tvOS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/accessibility/tvos/|title=Accessibility on tvOS|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|access-date=September 26, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are compatible with Apple's entire product line including the [[Apple Watch]] as a [[remote control]]ler for the Apple TV.

tvOS includes the Apple technologies of [[VoiceOver]], Zoom, and [[Siri]] to help the [[blindness|blind]] and those with low vision. Pairing a [[Bluetooth keyboard]] with the tvOS on the Apple TV enables another accessibility feature that also is an incorporation of VoiceOver. When typing, VoiceOver mirrors with an audio voice, each character pressed on the keyboard and repeated again when it is entered. The Apple TV is designed to work with the [[Apple Wireless Keyboard]] or the [[Magic Keyboard|Apple Magic Keyboard]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Apple TV with and without tvOS supports [[closed captioning]], so the deaf or hard of hearing can properly watch TV episodes and feature-length movies. Compatible episodes and movies are denoted with a CC (closed captioning) or SDH (Descriptive Audio) icon in the iTunes Store either on the Apple TV or in iTunes itself. The viewer can customize the captions in episodes or movies with styles and [[font]]s that are more conducive to their hearing and/or visual impairment.&lt;ref name="cc_4th_gen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202772|title=Turn on closed captions and subtitles on your Apple TV|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|access-date=September 26, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's Remote app on iOS devices allows control of the Apple TV from an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch.&lt;ref name="remote_app_cnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/how-to/what-to-do-if-you-lose-your-apple-tv-remote/|title=What to do if you lose your Apple TV remote|last=Elliott|first=Matt|date=March 2, 2017|website=[[CNET]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|access-date=September 26, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restrictions===
Similar to Google's redesign of YouTube, Apple has restricted access to most viewed charts on movies and podcasts. They are replaced by "Top Movies", "Top Podcasts", and "Editor's Picks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What's wrong with Apple TV |url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1140859/appletv.html |website=[[MacWorld]] |accessdate=13 August 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parental controls allow consumers to limit access to Internet media service content via "Restrictions" settings; individual services can be turned off (e.g., to reduce clutter), icons can be rearranged via the tap-and-hold technique ''Ã  la'' iOS. Internet media is split into four categories: "Internet Photos", "[[YouTube]]", "[[Podcast]]s", and "Purchase and Rental". Each of the categories is configured by a parental control of "Show", "Hide" or "Ask" to prompt for a 4-digit PIN. In addition, movies, TV shows, music and podcasts can be restricted by rating.&lt;ref name=ExtremeTech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/79958-hands-on-with-apple-tv-20 |title=Hands On with Apple TV 2.0 |first=Jim |last=Lynch |date=February 15, 2008 |publisher=[[ExtremeTech]] |accessdate=February 19, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Streaming video sources ===
Apps available for Apple TV can stream video from a variety of sources, including [[Netflix]], [[ESPN+]], [[Disney+]], [[Stan (company)|Stan]] ([[Australia]] only), [[Foxtel Now]] (Australia only), [[Hulu]], [[Now TV (UK)|Now TV]] ([[United Kingdom|UK]] only), [[Sling TV|SlingTV]], [[Amazon Video|Amazon Prime Video]], [[DirecTV]], [[YouTube]], [[Red Bull TV]], and [[Vevo]] along with [[HBO Now]], [[Showtime Anytime]], [[Starz]], and the [[TV Everywhere]] portals of several cable and broadcast networks, and the video subscription portals of all of the four major North American sports leagues: NFL TV app, [[MLB.tv]], [[NBA League Pass]], and [[National Hockey League#Out-of-market packages|NHL.tv]].

Apple TV in synchronization mode works in a way similar to the [[iPod]]. It is paired with an iTunes library on a single computer and can synchronize with that library, copying all or selected content to its own storage. Apple TV need not remain connected to the network after syncing.&lt;ref name=NoNetwork/&gt;&lt;ref name=syncHelp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.putques.com/sync-your-apple-tv-with-itune/ |title=iTunes for Windows 8.0 Help: Syncing your Apple TV with iTunes |publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] |accessdate=April 14, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302215237/http://www.putques.com/sync-your-apple-tv-with-itune/ |archivedate=March 2, 2014 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photos can be synced from [[iPhoto]], [[Aperture (software)|Aperture]], or from a folder on a [[Macintosh|Mac]], or Adobe Photoshop Album, [[Adobe Photoshop Elements|Photoshop Elements]], or from a hard disk folder in [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2265 |title=Apple TV: Syncing Photos via iTunes |publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] |accessdate=March 15, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226055718/http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2265 |archivedate=February 26, 2009 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple TV can also function as a [[peer-to-peer]] [[digital media player]], streaming content from iTunes libraries and playing the content over the network.&lt;ref name=arsReview&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/hardware/reviews/2007/03/appletv.ars|title=Apple TV: an in-depth review|first=Jacqui|last=Cheng|author2=Ecker, Clint|date=March 27, 2007|work=[[ArsTechnica]]|accessdate=April 2, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNNReview&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/ptech/03/27/apple.tv/index.html|title=Review: Apple TV best for iTunes addicts|first=John P.|last=Falcone|date=March 27, 2007|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=April 3, 2007|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070410041724/http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/ptech/03/27/apple.tv/index.html|archivedate=April 10, 2007 |url-status= live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1st generation Apple TVs can stream content from up to five computers or iTunes libraries. Also, five Apple TVs can be linked to the same iTunes library. The 2nd generation Apple TV onwards allows users to stream content from more than one iTunes library: these additional iTunes libraries can be on the same or on different computers. This is possible when Apple TV and every iTunes library from which you want to stream content meet all of the following conditions: (1) the Apple TV and the iTunes library you are streaming from are both on the same local network, (2) each uses the iTunes "Home Sharing" feature, and (3) each are using the same "Home Sharing" Apple ID.

4th generation Apple TVs and newer can also stream content locally using third party apps such as [[Plex (software)|Plex]] and [[VLC media player]].

====Supported formats====
Apple TV natively supports the following audio, video, and picture formats (although with the 4th generation, apps may use alternative built-in software in order to play other codecs and formats, e.g. [[VLC media player]]):

Apple TV streams video through an [[HDMI]] cable (Type A) connected to the TV's HDMI port. [[Sound|Audio]] is supported through the [[TOSLINK|optical]] or HDMI ports. The device also has a [[Micro-USB]] port, which is reserved for service and diagnostics. The device connects through [[Ethernet]] or [[Wi-Fi]] to the computer for digital content from the Internet and local networks. Apple TV does not come with audio, video or other cables, which must be acquired additionally as required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple TV technical specifications|url=https://www.apple.com/appletv/specs/|accessdate=June 4, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the previous Apple TV, media files could be transferred directly onto the device by syncing with another computer.

The device does not have [[RCA connector|RCA/composite video]] or [[F connector|F/RF]] connectors.&lt;ref name=CNNReview /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/appletv/specs.html|title=Apple TV&amp;nbsp;â€“ Tech Specs|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|accessdate=April 3, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407181857/http://www.apple.com/appletv/specs.html|archivedate=April 7, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with the 4th generation Apple TV, Apple removed the [[TOSLINK|optical]] audio port. Apple also enhanced the HDMI port by adding support for [[HDMI 1.4]]. The 4th generation also removed the [[Micro-USB]] port in favor of the reversible [[USB-C]] port and the 5th generation removed USB entirely.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

===AirPlay===
{{Main|AirPlay}}
AirPlay allows iOS devices or an [[AirPort]]-enabled computer with the [[iTunes]] music player to send a [[streaming media|stream]] of music to multiple (three to six, in typical conditions) stereos connected to an [[AirPort Express]] (the audio-only antecedent of Apple TV) or Apple TV.&lt;ref name=AirPlayHelp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3291|title=Apple TV: Using AirPlay|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=November 20, 2008|accessdate=March 12, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AirPort Express' streaming media capabilities use Apple's [[RAOP|Remote Audio Output Protocol]] (RAOP), a proprietary variant of [[RTSP]]/[[Real-time Transport Protocol|RTP]]. Using [[Wireless Distribution System|WDS]]-bridging,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2044|title=Apple WDS Setup|publisher=Support.apple.com|date=February 11, 2011|accessdate=March 28, 2012 |df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the AirPort Express can allow AirPlay functionality (as well as Internet access, file and print sharing, etc.) across a larger distance in a mixed environment of wired and up to 10 wireless clients.

Speakers attached to an AirPort Express or Apple TV can be selected from within the "Remote" iPhone/iPod Touch program, allowing full AirPlay compatibility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/itunes/remote |title=iTunes Remote |publisher=Apple |date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=March 28, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329190808/http://www.apple.com/itunes/remote/ |archivedate=March 29, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see "Remote control" section below).

Third-party keyboards that use the Apple layout may also be compatible.&lt;ref name="BluetoothWKB" /&gt;

On July 10, 2008, Apple released ''[[Remote (Apple software)|Remote]]'', a free [[iOS]] application that allows the [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]], and [[iPad]] to control the iTunes library on the Apple TV via [[Wi-Fi]].&lt;ref&gt;The Apple Remote Application can also be used to control your PC's iTunes library, Wi-Fi connected speaker system and more.{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/07/10/apples-remote-control-application-for-itunes-and-apple-tv|title=Apple's Remote: turns your iPhone into a WiFi remote control |first=Thomas |last=Ricker |work=[[Engadget]]|date=July 10, 2008|accessdate=July 14, 2008|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080714041642/http://www.engadget.com/2008/07/10/apples-remote-control-application-for-itunes-and-apple-tv |archivedate=July 14, 2008|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuaw.com/2008/07/10/apple-tv-2-1-update-goes-live-adds-mobileme-support |title=Apple TV 2.1 update goes live, adds MobileMe support|first=Cory|last=Bohon|publisher=The Unofficial Apple Weblog|date=July 10, 2008|accessdate=July 14, 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080714054244/http://www.tuaw.com/2008/07/10/apple-tv-2-1-update-goes-live-adds-mobileme-support |archivedate= July 14, 2008|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Apple Watch]] also has a remote app to control Apple TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://help.apple.com/watch/#/apd619078d99 |title=Control Apple TV |publisher=Help.apple.com |accessdate=July 10, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Remote App was updated on September 13, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Everything new in tvOS 10: Smarter Siri, dark mode, HomeKit, more |url=https://9to5mac.com/2016/09/13/tvos-10-whats-new-apple-tv/ |website=[[9to5mac]] |accessdate=13 August 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to take advantage of all the features of the Apple TV 4. This includes Siri, Touchpad, and Home Buttons, along with a now playing screen.

[[File:Apple tv gen 4 remote.jpeg|thumb|The [[Siri Remote|Apple Siri Remote]] is included with the fourth generation Apple TV and later, as well as being sold by itself.|alt=Apple Siri Remote Controller]]
On September 9, 2015, Apple announced the new Siri Remote for the 4th generation Apple TV (although in some territories, Apple have kept the name Apple TV Remote, due to Siri functionality not being enabled on it in that territory).&lt;ref name="Apple not siri remote 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/hk/en/tv/specs|title=Apple TV -Tech Specs - Apple (HK)|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|accessdate=November 4, 2015|df=mdy-all|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101202315/http://www.apple.com/hk/en/tv/specs/|archive-date=November 1, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a completely redesigned remote that features dual microphones for [[Siri]] support and a glass touch surface for navigation around the interface by swiping or tapping and scrubbing to fast forward or rewind. Also, it has a menu and home button, a Siri button to invoke Siri, a Play/Pause button, and a Volume Up/Down button to control the volume on the TV. The Siri Remote communicates with the Apple TV via Bluetooth rather than infrared, removing the requirement of a line-of-sight with the device. This new remote is only supported by the 4th generation Apple TV and later and will not work with earlier generations.

===Siri===
Beginning with the 4th generation Apple TV, the remote includes two microphones and a button to activate [[Siri]]. Siri on the Apple TV has all of the functions of Siri on iOS 9; it can also respond to requests specifically for the TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=9 Siri commands to use with your Apple TV remote |url=https://www.cnet.com/how-to/siri-commands-to-use-with-apple-tv-remote/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CNET]] |accessdate=12 August 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the viewer can ask Siri to search for a TV show or movie and it will search across multiple different sources to tell the user where the content is available to watch. It can also do things such as Play/Pause,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Everything You Can Say to Siri on the New Apple TV |url=https://fieldguide.gizmodo.com/everything-you-can-say-to-siri-on-the-new-apple-tv-1759487086 |website=[[Gizmodo]] |accessdate=12 August 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rewind/Fast Forward, skip back 15 seconds and temporarily turn on captioning when asked "what did he say?" or "what did she say?", open a specific app, and more.

==Software==
{{for|the media player application|Apple TV (software)}}
===1st generation===
The original Apple TV ran a modified build of [[Mac OS X Tiger|Mac OS X v10.4]] Tiger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/apple-tv/apple-tv-faq/apple-tv-operating-system-mac-os-x-applications-running-windows-ipod-games.html | title=What operating system do the Apple TV models use? Do they run Mac OS X? Do they run iOS? | publisher=EveryMac | date=April 12, 2013 | accessdate=September 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apple TV Software 1.0====
Apple TV software 1.0 presented the user with an interface similar to that of [[Front Row (software)|Front Row]]. Like Front Row on the Mac, it presents the user with seven options for consuming content. Movies, TV Shows, Music, Podcasts, Photos, Settings, and Sources. It was a modified version of OS x v10.4 Tiger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=From hobby to hero: The history of Apple TV |url= https://www.cultofmac.com/387297/hobby-hero-history-apple-tv/ |website=[[Cult of Mac]] |publisher=Cult of Mac |accessdate=12 August 2018 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apple TV Software 2.0====
In February 2008, Apple released a major and free upgrade to the Apple TV, labelled "Take Two"(2.0). This update did away with Front Row and introduced a new interface in which content was organized into six categories, all of which appeared in a large square box on the screen upon startup (movies, TV shows, music, [[YouTube]], podcasts, and photos) and presented in the initial menu, along with a "Settings" option for configuration, including software updates.&lt;ref name="MacNN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

====Apple TV Software 3.0====
In October 2009, Apple released a minor upgrade for the Apple TV called "Apple TV Software 3.0".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Picking the Ultimate Home Entertainment Box: Apple TV 3.0, why it's triple the meh |url=https://www.pcauthority.com.au/news/picking-the-ultimate-home-entertainment-box-apple-tv-30-why-its-triple-the-meh-160216 |website=PC Authority Australia |publisher=PC Authority Australia |accessdate=12 August 2018 |df=mdy-all |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813044202/https://www.pcauthority.com.au/news/picking-the-ultimate-home-entertainment-box-apple-tv-30-why-its-triple-the-meh-160216 |archive-date=August 13, 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; This update replaced the interface in version 2.0 with a new interface which presented seven horizontal columns across the top of the screen for the different categories of content (Movies, TV Shows, Music, Podcasts, Photos, Internet, and Settings).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hands On with Apple TV 3.0 |url=https://www.pcmag.com/feature/245546/hands-on-with-apple-tv-3-0 |website=[[PC Mag]] |accessdate=12 August 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This update also added features such as content filtering, iTunes Extras,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple Introduces Apple TV 3.0 Software With Redesigned User Interface |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2009/10/29Apple-Introduces-Apple-TV-3-0-Software-With-Redesigned-User-Interface/ |website=[[Apple Newsroom]] |publisher=Apple |accessdate=January 3, 2019|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; new fonts, and a new Internet radio app.

One new feature in particular was the 'Genius' playlist option allowing for easier and more user friendly playlist creating&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=12 Things You Need To Know About Apple TV 3.0 |url=https://gizmodo.com/5393023/12-things-you-need-to-know-about-apple-tv-30 |website=[[Gizmodo]] |accessdate=12 August 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2nd and 3rd generation===

The interface on Apple TV Software 4 is similar to that of previous versions, with only minor changes and feature additions throughout. In March 2012, Apple released a major new software update, with the Apple TV 3rd generation, labeled as Apple TV Software 5 (iOS 5.1),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Apple cutting off payment source changes for older versions of iOS |url= https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/06/28/apple-cutting-off-payment-source-changes-for-older-versions-of-ios-macos-apple-tv |website=[[AppleInsider]] |accessdate= 3 January 2019 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which shipped with the new 3rd generation Apple TV. This update completely revised the look of the home screen to make it resemble the icon grid seen on iOS. Instead of 7 columns, content and third-party channels are shown in a tiled grid format,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Apple TV 1080P Review (2012) |url= https://www.gottabemobile.com/apple-tv-1080p-review-2012/ |website= Gotta Be Mobile |accessdate= 3 January 2019 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be rearranged. Throughout the years, for Apple TV Software 5-6, Apple released minor revisions, content additions, and feature updates.

The Apple TV Software 7.0 features a flat look similar to iOS 7 and OS X Yosemite and adds features such as Peer-To-Peer AirPlay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 2013 Apple TV revision gets its first exclusive feature: iOS 8's Peer-to |url= https://9to5mac.com/2014/09/23/peer-to-peer-airplay-apple-tv-ios-8/ |website=[[9to5mac]] |accessdate= 12 August 2018 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Version 8.0 was skipped.

Apple TV Software 7.2.2 (iOS 8) is currently available for the Apple TV (3rd generation), as of March 2019. It does not support tvOS 9.0 or later. However, it does support [[Amazon Video]], which was automatically added to those Apple TVs running 7.2.2 on December 6, 2017.&lt;ref name=amazonvideo&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://9to5mac.com/2017/12/06/amazon-prime-video-app-available-apple-tv/ |title= Amazon Prime Video app rolling out to Apple TV App Store |date= 2017-12-06 |work=[[9to5Mac]] |access-date= 2017-12-06 |language= en-US |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2019 Apple TV Software 7.3 (iOS 8.4.2) was released to the public.  This update was the first update for the 3rd generation Apple TV since 2016.  This update adds the new Apple TV app to the home screen.  The Apple TV app brings compatibility to the Apple TV Channels service.  This update also fixes some security flaws found in Apple TV Software 7.2.2 and earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT210121|title=About the security content of Apple TV Software 7.3|website=Apple Support|language=en|access-date=2019-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, 2019, Apple TV Software 7.4 (iOS 8.4.3) was released to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/news/releases/?id=09242019a|title=Apple TV Software 7.4 (12H876) - Releases - Apple Developer|website=developer.apple.com|date=2019-09-24|access-date=2019-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===4th and 5th generation===
{{see also|tvOS}}
The fourth generation Apple TV and later run an [[operating system]] called ''[[tvOS]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=These are the most popular apps on Apple's new App Store |url=http://fortune.com/2015/11/02/new-apple-app-store/ |website=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |accessdate=13 August 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which does not support the earlier generations of Apple TV.

Apple's aim is to limit the size of application downloads and steering users toward downloading individual segments of apps in order to better manage storage space. Developers have reacted with criticism toward the download size limits, arguing that it leads to situations where game data is purged and has to be re-downloaded.&lt;ref name=polygon20151026 /&gt;

==Limitations==
===Functionality===
Apple TV contains neither a TV tuner nor a [[digital video recorder|personal video recorder]].&lt;ref name=arsReview /&gt;&lt;ref name=rogueReview/&gt; Both capabilities can be applied to the connected home computer through various third-party products, such as allowing PVR software to connect to iTunes and enable scheduled HDTV recordings to play automatically via Apple TV for playback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tuaw.com/2007/04/18/elgato-releases-eyetv-2-4-update|title=Elgato releases EyeTV 2.4 update|first=Erica|last=Sadun|date=April 18, 2007 |publisher=The Unofficial Apple Weblog|accessdate=April 20, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple TV prior to 4th generation does not support the [[Consumer Electronics Control|HDMI Consumer Electronics Control]] ([[HDMI CEC]]) protocol.

On the Apple TV (2nd generation), digital output audio is up-sampled to 48&amp;nbsp;kHz, including [[lossless compression|lossless]] CD rips at [[44,100 Hz|44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz]]. Although this is a higher frequency and the difference is not audible, it is seen by some as falling short of digital transmission of data standards due to the audio not being 'bit perfect'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avhub.com.au/editors-blog/sound-image/all-about-the-numbers-396105 |title=All about the numbers... |publisher=AVHub.com.au |date=February 23, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months into sales, [[Forrester Research]] predicted at the time that Apple would only sell a million Apple TV units, because consumers prefer advertisement-supported content over paid content. Forrester predicted that cable companies would be the clear winners over content providers such as the iTunes Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alwayson.goingon.com/permalink/post/14156 |title=Apple TV Sales Will Stall at 1 Million |first=Andy |last=Plesser |date=May 24, 2007 |publisher=AlwaysOn |accessdate=July 18, 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013154449/http://alwayson.goingon.com/permalink/post/14156 |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Apple released YouTube functionality and Jobs stated that Apple TV was a "DVD player for the Internet".
