'''Armas Clifford''' "'''Mike'''" '''Markkula Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɑr|ˈ|k|uː|l|ə}}; born February 11, 1942)&lt;ref name=FTLegends/&gt; is an American electrical engineer, businessman and investor. He was an [[angel investor]] and the second CEO of [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer, Inc.]], providing critical early funding and managerial support.

Markkula was introduced to [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Steve Wozniak]] when they were looking for funding to manufacture the [[Apple II]] personal computer they had developed, after having sold some units of the first version of this computer, the [[Apple I]]. With his guidance and funding, Apple ceased to be a partnership and was incorporated as a company.

[[Jeffrey Nordling]] portrayed him in the 1999 TNT film ''[[Pirates of Silicon Valley]]''. [[Dermot Mulroney]] later portrayed him in the 2013 film ''[[Jobs (film)|Jobs]]''.

==Early life==
Markkula's great-grandfather, Isak Ferdinand Markkula, was born in [[Sievi]], [[Finland]]. He and his wife moved to the United States in either 1865&lt;ref name=Kaleva&gt;[http://www.kaleva.fi/uutiset/pohjois-suomi/applen-perustajan-sukujuuret-sievissa/23729/ Profile],  kaleva.fi, April 7, 2007.{{in lang|fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1883, depending on the source.
Mike Markkula's first name ''Armas'' and last name ''Markkula'' are traditional [[Finnish language|Finnish]] names. His first name ''Armas'' means "dear" or "beloved" in the Finnish language.&lt;ref&gt;Kielitoimiston sanakirja (2012). Kotimaisten kielten keskuksen julkaisuja 166. Helsinki: Kotimaisten kielten keskus ja Kielikone. Internetpalvelu. {{ISBN|978-952-5446-68-5}}. ISSN 2242-461X; ISSN-L 2242-461X.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Markkula earned [[Bachelor of Science]] and [[Master of Science]] degrees in [[electrical engineering]] from the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref name=scu&gt;{{cite web|title=A.C. "Mike" Markkula Jr.|url=http://www.scu.edu/ethics/about/people/advisory/markkula.html|publisher=Santa Clara University|accessdate=2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He made millions on [[stock option]]s he acquired as a marketing manager for [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] and [[Intel]], able to retire at 32.&lt;ref name=markoff19970901&gt;{{cite news|last=Markoff|first=John|title=An 'Unknown' Co-Founder Leaves After 20 Years of Glory and Turmoil|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/01/business/an-unknown-co-founder-leaves-after-20-years-of-glory-and-turmoil.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=2011-02-04|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1997-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apple===
He was lured out of retirement by Steve Jobs, who was referred to him by [[Regis McKenna]] and venture capitalist [[Don Valentine]].{{r|markoff19970901}} Valentine&amp;mdash;who after meeting the young, unkempt Jobs asked McKenna, ''"Why did you send me this renegade from the human race?"''&amp;mdash;was not interested in funding Apple, but mentioned Jobs' new company to Markkula.&lt;ref name="time19820215"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,925280,00.html|title=The Seeds of Success|accessdate=2011-02-23|date=1982-02-15|publisher=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs visited Markkula and convinced him of the market for the Apple II and for personal computers in general.{{r|markoff19970901}} 

In 1977, Markkula brought his business expertise along with $250,000 (with $80,000 as an [[equity investment]] in the company and $170,000 as a loan) and became a one-third owner of Apple and employee number 3.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Livingston, Founders at Work - Stories of Startups' Early Days, Interview with Steve Wozniak, pg. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steve Wozniak]], who designed the first two Apple computers, credits Markkula for the success of Apple more than himself.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Zasky, [http://failuremag.com/article/steve-wozniak-interview "The Failure Interview: Apple Computer Co-Founder Steve Wozniak"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215110532/http://failuremag.com/article/steve-wozniak-interview|date=2013-12-15}}, ''Failure Magazine'', July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He helped the new company obtain [[line of credit|credit]] and venture capital,{{r|time19820215}} brought in [[Michael Scott (Apple Computer)|Michael Scott]] as the first president and CEO, then took the job himself from 1981 to 1983 despite having promised his wife that he would only stay at Apple for four years,{{r|markoff19970901}} and that he would retire by 1984.{{r|time19820215}} 

Markkula served as chairman from 1985-97, when a new board was formed after Jobs returned to the company. As chairman he approved [[Jef Raskin]]'s 1979 plan to start designing what would become the [[Macintosh]], then prevented Jobs from killing the project in favor of his own [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=And_Another_Thing....txt|title=And Another Thing...|author=Andy Hertzfeld|publisher=Folklore.org |date=March 1982 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927120311/http://folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=And_Another_Thing....txt|archivedate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1985, Markkula took [[John Sculley]]'s side in a dispute with Jobs, causing the latter to leave the company; he would later help to force Sculley out in 1993.{{r|markoff19970901}}

In addition to providing what ''[[The New York Times]]'' later described as "adult supervision" to the younger Jobs and Wozniak, as a trained engineer Markkula also possessed technical skills. He wrote several early Apple II programs, served as a [[beta tester]] for Apple hardware and software, and wrote one of the first three programs available for the unsuccessful [[Apple III]]. Wozniak was motivated to design the [[Disk II]] floppy disk drive system after Markkula found that a checkbook-balancing program he had written loaded too slowly from a [[data cassette]].{{r|markoff19970901}}&lt;ref name="coventry20131006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lowendmac.com/2013/apple-iii-chaos-apples-first-failure|title=Apple III Chaos: Apple's First Failure|publisher=Low End Mac|date=2013-10-06|accessdate=July 1, 2014|author=Coventry, Joshua}}&lt;/ref&gt; Markkula retired from Apple after Jobs returned as interim CEO in 1996. He supported Jobs' 1997 return.

===After Apple===
After he retired from Apple, he went on to work at [[Echelon Corporation]], ACM Aviation, San Jose Jet Center and Rana Creek Habitat Restoration and to endow the [[Markkula Center for Applied Ethics]] at [[Santa Clara University]], where he now chairs the Board.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Markkula was an investor in Crowd Technologies, a startup developing a web application called [[Piqqem]] that applies the [[wisdom of crowds]] to stock market predictions. He is an investor in [[Scotland]]-based [[LiveCode (company)|LiveCode]], Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/business/companies/tech/livecode-goes-open-source-as-runrev-raises-500-000-1-2885696|title=LiveCode goes open source as RunRev raises £500,000|last=Ranscombe|first=Peter|date=April 10, 2013|website=The Scotsman|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200122034338/https://www.scotsman.com/business/companies/tech/livecode-goes-open-source-as-runrev-raises-500-000-1-2885696|archive-date=January 22, 2020|access-date=2020-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
