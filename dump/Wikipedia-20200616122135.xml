'''Roman Syria''' was an early [[Roman province]] annexed to the [[Roman Republic]] in 64 BC by [[Pompey]] in the [[Third Mithridatic War]] following the defeat of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|King of Armenia]] [[Tigranes the Great]].&lt;ref name="Books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sicker|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Sicker|title=Between Rome and Jerusalem: 300 Years of Roman-Judaean Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKK4ge9FD14C&amp;pg=PA39|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-97140-3|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the partition of the [[Herodian Kingdom of Judea]] into tetrarchies in 6 AD, it was gradually absorbed into Roman provinces, with Roman Syria annexing the [[Herodian Tetrarchy]].

== Provincia Syria ==

During the early empire, the Roman army in Syria accounted for three legions with auxiliaries{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} who defended the border with [[Parthia]]. Following the partition of Judea into tetrarchies in 6 CE, it was gradually absorbed into Roman provinces, with Roman Syria initially annexing the Tetrarchy around 34 AD.

Syrian province forces were directly engaged in the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] of 66–70 AD. In 66 AD, [[Cestius Gallus]], legate of Syria, brought the Syrian army, based on [[Legio XII Fulminata]], reinforced by auxiliary troops, to restore order in Judaea and quell the revolt. The legion, however, was ambushed and destroyed by Jewish rebels at the [[Battle of Beth Horon (66)|Battle of Beth Horon]], a result that shocked the Roman leadership. The future emperor [[Vespasian]] was then put in charge of subduing the Jewish revolt. In the summer of 69, Vespasian, with the Syrian units supporting him, launched his bid to become Roman emperor. He defeated his rival [[Vitellius]] and ruled as emperor for ten years when he was succeeded by his son [[Titus]].

Based on an inscription recovered from [[Tel Dor|Dor]] in 1948, Gargilius Antiquus was known to have been the governor of a province in the eastern part of the Empire, possibly Syria, between his consulate and governing Asia.&lt;ref name=Gera-Cotton&gt;Dov Gera and Hannah M. Cotton, [http://dor.huji.ac.il/Download/Article/QedemReports2_Ch14.pdf "A Dedication from Dor to a Governor of Syria"], ''Israel Exploration Journal'', 41 (1991), pp. 258–66&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, an inscription in Greek was recovered off the coast of Dor by [[Haifa University]] underwater archaeologists, which attests that Antiquus was governor of the province of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] between 120 and 130, possibly prior to the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/archaeology/1.756193 Divers Find Unexpected Roman Inscription From the Eve of Bar-Kochba Revolt] Haaretz.com (Last accessed 6 June 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creation of Syria Palæstina ==
{{main|Syria Palaestina}}
As related by [[Theodor Mommsen]],
{{quote|The governor of Syria retained the civil administration of the whole large province undiminished, and held for long alone in all Asia a command of the first rank. [...] It was only in the course of the second century that a diminution of his prerogatives occurred, when [[Hadrian]] took [[Legio III Gallica|one of the four legions]] from the governor of Syria and handed it over to the governor of Palestine.&lt;ref name="Mommsen 1886 117–118"&gt;{{harvnb|Mommsen|1886|pp=117–118}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
"Hadrian stationed [[Legio III Gallica|an extra legion]] in [[Judea (Roman province)|Judaea]], renaming it Syria Palaestina."&lt;ref name="Adkins &amp; Adkins"&gt;{{harvnb|Adkins|Adkins|1998|p=121}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was following the defeat of the [[Bar Kokhba Revolt]] in 135 AD. The Syria-based legion, [[Legio III Gallica]], took part in the quelling of the revolt in 132–136, and in the aftermath, the emperor [[Hadrian]] renamed  the greatly depopulated province of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] and its extra legion ''Syria Palaestina''.

[[Septimius Severus]] divided the remainder of the province of Syria into [[Coele Syria (Roman province)|Syria Coele]] and [[Syria Phoenice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Marquardt|1892|p=373}}: "Tandis que la Judée ou Syria Palaestina demeurait ainsi séparée de la Syrie depuis l'an 66 après J.-C., la Syrie elle-même fut plus tard divisée en deux provinces : la Syria magna ou Syria Coele, et la Syria Phoenice".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adkins|Adkins|1998|p=121}}: "Septimius Severus divided the remaining province into Syria Coele and Syria Phoenice".&lt;/ref&gt; with Antioch and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] as their respective provincial capitals.

As related by [[Theodor Mommsen]],
{{quote|It was [[Septimius Severus|Severus]] who at length withdrew the first place in the Roman military hierarchy from the Syrian governor. After having subdued the province—which had wished at that time to make [[Pescennius Niger|Niger]] emperor, as it had formerly done with its governor [[Vespasian]]—amidst resistance from the capital Antioch in particular, he ordained its partition into a northern and a southern half, and gave to the governor of the former, which was called [[Coele Syria (Roman province)|Coele-Syria]], two legions, to the governor of the latter, the province of [[Syria Phoenice|Syro-Phoenicia]], one [legion].&lt;ref name="Mommsen 1886 117–118"&gt;{{harvnb|Mommsen|1886|pp=117–118}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From the later 2nd century, the [[Roman Senate]] included several notable Syrians, including [[Claudius Pompeianus]] and [[Avidius Cassius]].

Syria was of crucial strategic importance during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. In 244 AD, Rome was ruled by a native Syrian from Philippopolis (modern day [[Shahba]]) in the province of Arabia Petraea. The emperor was Marcus Iulius Philippus, more commonly known as [[Philip the Arab]]. Philip became the 33rd emperor of Rome upon its millennial celebration.

Roman Syria was invaded in 252/253 (the date is disputed) after a Roman field army was destroyed in the [[Battle of Barbalissos]] by the King of Persia [[Shapur I]] which left the Euphrates river unguarded and the region was pillaged by the Persians. In 259/260 a similar event happened when [[Shapur I]] again defeated a Roman field army and captured the Roman emperor, Valerian, alive at the [[Battle of Edessa]]. Again Roman Syria suffered as cities were captured, sacked and pillaged.

From 268 to 273, Syria was part of the breakaway [[Palmyrene Empire]].

=== Dominate reform===
Following the reforms of [[Diocletian]], Syria Coele became part of the [[Diocese of the East]].&lt;ref name="ODB1999"&gt;{{cite book | first = Alexander (Ed.) | last = Kazhdan | title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6 | page=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime between 330 and 350 (likely c. 341), the province of ''[[Euphratensis]]'' was created out of the territory of ''Syria Coele'' along the western bank of the [[Euphrates]] and the former [[Kingdom of Commagene]], with [[Manbij|Hierapolis]] as its capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Alexander (Ed.) | last = Kazhdan | title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6 | page=748}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syria in the Byzantine Empire===
{{see|History of the Byzantine Empire}}
[[File:Mosaic of the Female Musicians.jpg|thumb|20 square meter [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era mosaic found in [[Maryamin, Homs|Maryamin]], [[Syria]], currently located in the Hama museum|alt=]]
After c. 415 ''Syria Coele'' was further subdivided into ''Syria I'' (or ''[[Syria Prima]]''), with the capital remaining at [[Antioch]], and ''Syria II'' (''Syria Secunda'') or ''Syria Salutaris'', with capital at [[Apamea on the Orontes]]. In 528, [[Justinian I]] carved out the small coastal province ''[[Theodorias (province)|Theodorias]]'' out of territory from both provinces.&lt;ref name="ODB1999"/&gt;
[[File:Church of Saint Simeon Stylites 17.jpg|thumb|[[Church of Saint Simeon Stylites]], one of the oldest surviving churches in the world]]
The region remained one of the most important provinces of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. It was [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628|occupied]] by the [[Sasanians]] between 609 and 628, then reconquered by the emperor [[Heraclius]], but  lost again to the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|advancing Muslims]] after the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] and the [[Battle of the Iron Bridge|fall of Antioch]].&lt;ref name="ODB1999"/&gt;
The city of [[Antioch]] was reconquered by [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephorus Phocas]] in 963, along with other parts of the country, at that time under the [[Hamdanids]], although still under the official suzerainty of the [[Abbasids|Abbasid]] caliphs and also claimed by the [[Fatimids|Fatimid]] caliphs. After emperor [[John I Tzimiskes|John Kurkuas]]'s failed to conquer Syria up to Jerusalem a Muslim "reconquest" of Syria followed in the late 970s undertaken by the Fatimid Caliphate which resulted in the ouster of the Byzantines from most parts of Syria. However, Antioch and other northern parts of Syria remained in the empire and other parts were under the protection of the [[Macedonian dynasty|emperors]] through their Hamdanid, [[Mirdasid dynasty|Mirdasid]], and [[Marwanids|Marwanid]] proxies, until the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] arrival, who after three decades of incursions, conquered Antioch in 1084. Antioch was captured again during the 12th century by the revived armies of the [[Byzantine Empire under the Komnenos dynasty|Comnenii]]. However, by that time the city was regarded as part of Asia Minor and not of Syria.
