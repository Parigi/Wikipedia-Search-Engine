'''Logo''' is an [[educational programming language]], designed in 1967 by [[Wally Feurzeig]], [[Seymour Papert]], and [[Cynthia Solomon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/6226 |title=Logo Manual |last=Abelson |first=Hal |last2=Goodman |first2=Nat |date=December 1974 |website=Artificial Intelligence Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology |access-date=August 28, 2016 |last3=Rudolph |first3=Lee |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911020834/https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/6226 |archive-date=September 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Logo'' is not an acronym: the name was coined by Feurzeig while he was at [[Bolt, Beranek and Newman]],&lt;ref name="goldenberg198208"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-08/1982_08_BYTE_07-08_Logo#page/n209/mode/2up |title=Logo – A Cultural Glossary |last=Goldenberg |first= E. Paul |date=August 1982 |work=Byte |access-date=19 October 2013|pages=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; and derives from the Greek ''logos'', meaning ''word'' or ''thought''.

A general-purpose language, Logo is widely known for its use of [[turtle graphics]], in which commands for movement and drawing produced line or [[vector graphics]], either on screen or with a small robot termed a [[Turtle (robot)|turtle]]. The language was conceived to teach concepts of programming related to [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] and only later to enable what Papert called "[[kinesthetic|body-syntonic]] reasoning", where students could understand, predict, and reason about the turtle's motion by imagining what they would do if they were the turtle. There are substantial differences among the many dialects of Logo, and the situation is confused by the regular appearance of turtle graphics programs that are named Logo.

Logo is a [[Multi-paradigm programming language|multi-paradigm]] adaptation and dialect of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], a [[functional programming]] language.&lt;ref name=cslsPreface &gt;CSLS Vol 1, Preface .pxvi, Harvey 1997&lt;/ref&gt; There is no standard Logo, but [[UCBLogo]] has the best facilities for handling lists, files, I/O, and [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]] in scripts, and can be used to teach all computer science concepts, as [[UC Berkeley]] lecturer [[Brian Harvey (lecturer)|Brian Harvey]] did in his ''Computer Science Logo Style'' trilogy.&lt;ref name=csls&gt;''Computer Science Logo Style'', Brian Harvey, MIT Press (3 volumes) {{ISBN|0-262-58148-5}}, {{ISBN|0-262-58149-3}}, {{ISBN|0-262-58150-7}}. Available [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704014342/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ |date=2013-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logo is usually an interpreted language, although compiled Logo dialects (such as Lhogho and Liogo) have been developed. Logo is not case-sensitive but retains the case used for formatting purposes.

==History==
Logo was created in 1967 at [[Bolt, Beranek and Newman]] (BBN), a [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] research firm, by [[Wally Feurzeig]], [[Cynthia Solomon]], and [[Seymour Papert]].&lt;ref name="mit.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/index.html |title=Logo Foundation |website=el.media.mit.edu |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721122057/http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/index.html |archive-date=2011-07-21 |access-date=2011-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its intellectual roots are in [[artificial intelligence]], [[mathematical logic]] and [[developmental psychology]]. The first four years of Logo research, development and teaching work was done at BBN. The first implementation of Logo, called Ghost, was written in [[LISP]] on a [[PDP-1]]. The goal was to create a mathematical land where children could play with words and sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://logothings.wikispaces.com/ |title=logothings |website=logothings.wikispaces.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207111525/http://logothings.wikispaces.com/ |archive-date=2011-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modeled on LISP, the design goals of Logo included accessible power{{Clarify |date=March 2008}} &lt;!-- what kinda of power? --&gt; and informative error messages. The use of virtual [[Turtle (robot)|Turtles]] allowed for immediate visual feedback and debugging of graphic programming.

The first working [[turtle (robot)|Logo turtle robot]] was created in 1969. A display turtle preceded the physical floor turtle. Modern Logo has not changed very much from the basic concepts predating the first turtle. The first turtle was a tethered floor roamer, not [[radio-control]]led or [[wireless]]. At BBN Paul Wexelblat developed a turtle named Irving that had touch sensors and could move forwards, backwards, rotate, and ding its bell. The earliest year-long school users of Logo were in 1968–69 at Muzzey Jr. High in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]]. The virtual and physical turtles were first used by fifth-graders at the Bridge School in the same city in 1970–71.

==Turtle and graphics==
{{see also|Turtle graphics}}

Logo's most-known feature is the turtle (derived originally from [[Turtle (robot)|a robot of the same name]]),&lt;ref name="mit.edu"/&gt; an on-screen "[[Pointer (graphical user interfaces)|cursor]]" that showed output from commands for movement and small retractable pen, together producing line graphics. It has traditionally been displayed either as a triangle or a turtle icon (though it can be represented by any icon). Turtle graphics were added to the Logo language by Seymour Papert in the late 1960s to support Papert's version of the [[turtle (robot)|turtle robot]], a simple robot controlled from the user's workstation that is designed to carry out the drawing functions assigned to it using a small retractable pen set into or attached to the robot's body.

As a practical matter, the use of turtle geometry instead of a more traditional model mimics the actual movement logic of the turtle robot. The turtle moves with commands that are relative to its own position, ''LEFT 90'' means spin left by 90 degrees. Some Logo implementations, particularly those that allow the use of concurrency and multiple turtles, support [[collision detection]] and allow the user to redefine the appearance of the turtle cursor, essentially allowing the Logo turtles to function as [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]].

Multiple turtles are supported by [[MSWLogo]], as well as 3D graphics. Input from COM ports and LPT ports are also allowed by MSWLogo through windows GUI. Interrupts can be triggered via keyboard and mouse events. Simple [[GIF]] animations may also be produced on MSWLogo version 6.5 with the ''gifsave'' command.

Turtle geometry is also sometimes used in environments other than Logo as an alternative to a strictly coordinate-addressed graphics system. For instance, the idea of turtle graphics is also useful in [[Lindenmayer system]] for generating [[fractal]]s.

Some modern derivatives of Logo allow thousands of independently moving turtles. There are two popular implementations: [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s [[StarLogo]] and [[Northwestern University]] Center for Connected Learning's (CCL) [[NetLogo]]. They allow exploring [[emergence|emergent phenomena]] and come with many experiments in social studies, biology, physics, and other areas. NetLogo is widely used in agent-based simulation in the biological and social sciences.

Although there is no one agreed-upon standard, there is a broad consensus on core aspects of the language. As of March 2020 there were 308 implementations and dialects of Logo, each with its own strengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pavel.it.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/logotree/pdf/LogoTree.pdf |title=The Logo Tree Project |website=elica.net |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306084150/http://elica.net/download/papers/LogoTreeProject.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-06 |access-date=2020-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of those 308 are no longer in wide use, but many are still under active development. Commercial Logos that are still widely used in schools include ''[[MicroWorlds]] Logo'' and ''Imagine Logo''.

* Apple Logo for the [[Apple II Plus]] and Apple Logo Writer for the [[Apple IIe]], developed by Logo Computer Systems, Inc. (LCSI), were the most broadly used and prevalent early implementations of Logo that peaked in the early to mid-1980s.
* [[Atari Logo]] was released on cartridge by Atari for the [[Atari 8-bit family]].
* Color Logo was released in 1983 on cartridge (26-2722) and disk (26-2721) by Tandy for the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]]
* Commodore Logo was released, with the subtitle "A Language for Learning", by [[Commodore Electronics]]. It was based on MIT Logo and enhanced by Terrapin, Inc. The [[Commodore 64]] version (C64105) was released on diskette in 1983; the [[Commodore Plus/4|Plus/4]] version (T263001) was released on cartridge in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zimmers.net/commie/docs/cbm-products.txt |title=Canonical List of Commodore Products |date=2017-10-30 |access-date=2017-12-03 |last1=Brain |first1=Jim |last2=Zimmerman |first2=Bo |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220005631/http://www.zimmers.net/commie/docs/cbm-products.txt |archive-date=2017-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plus4world.powweb.com/software/Logo |title=Logo – Software Details |website=Plus/4 World |access-date=2017-12-03 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204171250/http://plus4world.powweb.com/software/Logo |archive-date=2017-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ExperLogo was released in 1985 on floppy by Expertelligence Inc. for the [[Macintosh 128K]].
* Hot-Logo was released in the mid-1980s by EPCOM for the [[MSX]] 8-bit computers with its own set of commands in Brazilian Portuguese. 
* TI Logo (for the [[TI 99/4A]] computer) was also used in primary schools, emphasizing Logo's usefulness in teaching computing fundamentals to novice programmers.
* IBM marketed their own version of Logo (P/N 6024076), also developed by Logo Computer Systems, Inc. (LCSI), for their then-new IBM PC.
* [[UCBLogo]], also known as Berkeley Logo, is free and cross-platform standard Logo last released in 2009. Subsequently, George Mills at MIT used UCBLogo as the basis for ''[[MSWLogo]]'' which is more refined and also free. After that, Jim Muller wrote a book, ''The Great Logo Adventure'', which was a complete Logo manual and which used MSWLogo as the demonstration language. It is now out of print, but Jim has released all the files in pdf format. (Check the Logo Foundation website for details.) MSWLogo has evolved into [http://sourceforge.net/projects/fmslogo/ FMSLogo: An Educational Programming Environment].

* [[Acornsoft Logo]], released in 1985 for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron.
* In February 1990, ''Electron User'' published Timothy Grantham's simple implementation of Logo for the [[Acorn Electron]] under the article "Talking Turtle".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/mags/eu/ills/7_05/s-p20.jpg Talking Turtle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170328011620/http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/mags/eu/ills/7_05/s-p20.jpg |date=2017-03-28 }} page 20 and 21&lt;/ref&gt;
* Work continues to be done in writing Logo implementations. In 2012, the LibreOffice team developed [[LibreLogo]] as an extension to some LibreOffice versions. This Logo is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and allows vector graphics to be written in Writer. At least two web based Logos using Berkeley Logo, HTML5, CSS3 and [[JQuery]] can be found.
* [http://www.pool.rnd.team POOL] is a dialect of LOGO with object-oriented extensions, implemented in 2014. POOL programs are compiled and run in the graphical IDE on [[Microsoft Windows]]. Simplified, cross-platform environment is also available for systems supporting [[.NET Framework]].
* [http://qlogo.org/ QLogo] is an open-source and cross-platform rewrite of [[UCBLogo]] with nearly full UCB compatibility that uses hardware-accelerated graphics.

===ObjectLOGO===
'''ObjectLOGO''' is a variant of Logo with [[object-oriented programming]] extensions and lexical scoping. Version 2.7 was sold by Digitool, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitool.com/ol-specs.html Object Logo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430083030/http://www.digitool.com/ol-specs.html |date=2008-04-30 }} page on the Digitool website (accessed 4 March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  It is no longer being developed or supported, and does not run on versions of the Mac operating system later than version 7.5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitool.com/ol-purchase.html Object Logo ordering page] on the Digitool website (accessed 4 March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lego Logo===
'''Lego Logo''' was a version of Logo  which could manipulate robotic [[Lego]] bricks attached to a computer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://llk.media.mit.edu/papers/BCK.html Behavior Construction Kits]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was implemented on the [[Apple II]] computing platform and was used in American and other grade schools in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucls.uchicago.edu/students/projects/1994-95/Lego-Logo/ProjectDescription.html '''Lego/LOGO Project'''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720072907/http://www.ucls.uchicago.edu/students/projects/1994-95/Lego-Logo/ProjectDescription.html |date=2011-07-20 }} at UCLS&lt;/ref&gt; Lego Logo was a precursor to [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]].

===Acornsoft Logo===
'''Acornsoft Logo''' is a commercial implementation of Logo for the 8-bit [[BBC Micro]] and [[Acorn Electron]] computers.&lt;ref name="field"&gt;{{cite book | title=LOGO on the BBC computer and Acorn Electron | publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] | author=Field, Graham | year=1985 | isbn=0-333-39566-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acornsoft Logo was developed for [[Acorn Computers]] as a full implementation of Logo. It features multiple screen [[turtle (robot)|turtle]]s and four-channel sound. It was provided on two 16kB [[Read Only Memory|ROM]]s, with utilities and [[device driver|driver]]s as accompanying software.&lt;ref name="tmu four logos"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nostalgia8.nl/logo/docs/mudeel1.jpg | title=Four Logos for the BBC Micro | publisher=[[The Micro User]] | work=The Micro User Education Special | accessdate=February 20, 2012 | author=Radburn, Derek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Logo was a primary influence on the [[Smalltalk]] programming language. It is also the main influence on the [[Etoys (programming language)|Etoys]] educational programming environment and language, which is essentially a Logo variant written in [[Squeak]] (itself a variant of [[Smalltalk]]). Logo influenced the procedure/method model in [[AgentSheets]] and AgentCubes to program agents similar to the notion of a turtle in Logo. Logo provided the underlying language for Boxer. Boxer was developed at [[University of California, Berkeley]] and MIT and is based on a ''literacy model'', making it easier to use for nontechnical people.{{citation needed |date=September 2015}}

[[KTurtle]] is a variation of Logo implemented at [[Qt (software)|Qt]] for the [[KDE]] environment loosely based on Logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edu.kde.org/kturtle/ |title=The KDE Education Project – KTurtle |website=edu.kde.org |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827165231/http://edu.kde.org/kturtle/ |archive-date=2006-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two more results of Logo's influence are [[Kojo (programming language)|Kojo]], a variant of Scala, and [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]], a visual, drag-and-drop language which runs in a web browser.

In 2015, [[Primo Toys|Cubetto]], an educational robotics system for children aged three years and older, was developed through crowd-sourced funding. Cubetto was influenced both by LOGO and by [[Maria Montessori|Montessori]]. Cubetto features a small cubic Turtle that turns only through 90 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.primotoys.com/ |title=Cubetto: A toy robot teaching kids code &amp; computer programming |website=Primo Toys |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902141735/https://www.primotoys.com/ |archive-date=2016-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cubetto has been described as an update of the button-box MIT LOGO system TORTIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://harveycohen.net/oznaki |title=OZNAKI Project |website=harveycohen.net |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820163758/http://harveycohen.net/oznaki/ |archive-date=2016-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
