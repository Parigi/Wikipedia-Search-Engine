{{short description|Word, phrase, number, or other sequence of units that may be read the same way in either direction}}
A  '''palindrome''' is a word, [[palindromic number|number]], phrase, or other sequence of [[Character (symbol)|characters]] which reads the same backward as forward, such as ''madam'', ''racecar''. There are also numeric palindromes, including date/time stamps using short digits ''11/11/11 11:11'' and long digits ''02/02/2020.'' Sentence-length palindromes may be written when allowances are made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers, such as "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!".

[[File:Ambigram_palindrome_ΝΙΨΟΝΑΝΟΜΗΜΑΤΑΜΗΜΟΝΑΝΟΨΙΝ_(Wash_your_sins,_not_only_your_face,_in_Greek).jpg|thumb|200px|Palindrome ΝΙΨΟΝ ΑΝΟΜΗΜΑΤΑ ΜΗ ΜΟΝΑΝ ΟΨΙΝ ([[:en:Nipson anomemata me monan opsin|Nipson anomemata me monan opsin]], ''Wash your sins, not only your face'') inscribed in ancient Greek upon a holy water font. The phrase can be read from left to right or from right to left.]]

Composing literature in palindromes is an example of [[constrained writing]].

The word ''palindrome'' was first published by Henry Peacham in his book, ''The Truth of Our Times'' (1638). It is derived from the Greek roots ''{{lang|grc-Latn|palin}}'' ({{lang|grc|πάλιν}}; "again") and ''{{lang|grc-Latn|dromos}}'' ({{lang|grc|δρóμος}}; "way, direction"); however, the Greek language uses a different word, καρκινικός 'carcinic' (lit. ''crab-like'') to refer to letter-by-letter reversible writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greek-language.gr/greekLang/modern_greek/tools/lexica/search.html?lq=%CE%BA%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BA%CE%B9%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%82&amp;dq=|title=Combined word search for καρκινικός|last=Triantaphylides Dictionary|first=Portal for the Greek Language|date=|website=www.greek-language.gr|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=2019-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Martin Leake]], ''Researches in Greece'', 1814, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The ancient Greek poet [[Sotades]] (3rd century BCE) invented a form of [[Ionic meter]] called Sotadic or Sotadean verse, which is sometimes said to have been palindromic,&lt;ref name="hbw"/&gt; but no examples survive,&lt;ref name="pepp-pal"/&gt; and the exact nature of the "reverse" readings is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Kwapisz, ''The Paradign of Simias: Essays on Poetic Eccentricity'', p. 62-68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Preminger, ed., ''Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'', 1965, {{jstor|j.ctt13x0qvn}}, ''s.v.'' 'Sotadean', p. 784&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Century Dictionary]]'', 1889, ''s.v.'' 'Sotadic', p. '''5''':5780. "Sotadic verse... A palindromic verse; so named apparently from some ancient examples of Sotadean verse being palindromic."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sator Square at Oppède.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sator Square]].]]
A palindrome was found as a graffito at [[Herculaneum]], a city buried by ash in 79 CE. This palindrome, called the [[Sator Square]], consists of a sentence written in Latin: "[[Sator Square|Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas]]" ("The sower Arepo holds with effort the wheels"). It is remarkable for the fact that the first letters of each word form the first word, the second letters form the second word, and so forth. Hence, it can be arranged into a [[word square]] that reads in four different ways: horizontally or vertically from either top left to bottom right or bottom right to top left. As such, they can be referred to as palindromatic. {{citation needed|reason=Palindromatic not found in OED|date=August 2015}}

A palindrome with the same square property is the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] palindrome, "We explained the glutton who is in the honey was burned and incinerated", (&lt;span class="script-hebrew" style="font-size:145%; font-family:'SBL Hebrew', David, Narkisim, 'Times New Roman', 'Ezra SIL SR', FrankRuehl, 'Microsoft Sans Serif', 'Lucida Grande'" dir="rtl"&gt;פרשנו&amp;nbsp;רעבתן&amp;nbsp;שבדבש&amp;nbsp;נתבער&amp;nbsp;ונשרף&lt;/span&gt;; ''perashnu: ra`avtan shebad'vash nitba`er venisraf''), credited to [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] in 1924,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and referring to the [[Halacha|halachic]] question as to whether a fly landing in honey makes the honey ''[[Kashrut|treif]]'' (non-kosher).

[[File:Greek palindrome on the font.jpg|thumb|Palindrome on the font at [[St Martin, Ludgate]]]]

The palindromic Latin riddle "''In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni''" ("we go in a circle at night and are consumed by fire") describes the behavior of moths. It is likely that this palindrome is from medieval rather than ancient times. The second word, borrowed from Greek, should properly be spelled ''gyrum''.

[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Greeks]] often inscribed the palindrome, "Wash [thy] sins, not only [thy] face" {{lang|grc|ΝΙΨΟΝ ΑΝΟΜΗΜΑΤΑ ΜΗ ΜΟΝΑΝ ΟΨΙΝ}} ("''[[Nipson anomemata me monan opsin|Nip&amp;#860;s
on anomēmata mē monan op&amp;#860;s
in]]''"), attributed to [[Gregory of Nazianzus]],&lt;ref name="pepp-pal"&gt;Alex Preminger, ed., ''Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'', 1965, {{jstor|j.ctt13x0qvn}}, ''s.v.'' 'palindrome', p. 596&lt;/ref&gt; on [[baptismal font]]s; most notably in the basilica of [[Hagia Sophia]], i.e. of the Holy Wisdom of God, in [[Constantinople]]. A variant, also a palindrome, replaces the plural {{lang|grc|ΑΝΟΜΗΜΑΤΑ}} ("sins") by the singular {{lang|grc|ΑΝΟΜΗΜΑ}} ("sin"). This practice was continued in many churches in Western Europe, such as the font at [[St. Mary's Church, Nottingham]] and also the font of St. Stephen d'Egres, [[Paris]]; at St. Menin's Abbey, [[Orléans]]; at [[Dulwich College]]; and at the following churches in England: [[Worlingworth]] (Suffolk), [[Harlow]] (Essex), [[Knapton]] (Norfolk), [[St Martin, Ludgate]] (London), and [[Hadleigh, Suffolk|Hadleigh]] (Suffolk).

A Greek poet in 1802 Vienna even composed a poem, Ποίημα Καρκινικόν (''Carcinic Poem''), in [[Ancient Greek]], where every one of the 455 lines was a palindrome.&lt;ref name="nmm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Αμβρόσιος Ιερομόναχος του Παμπέρεως ([[Hieromonk]] Ambrosios Pamperis), Ποίημα Καρκινικόν, Vienna, 1802 [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Poiema_karkinikon_meta_scholion_kai_tou/UeJiAAAAcAAJ full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, there are dozens of palindrome ''words'', such as ''eye'', ''madam'', and ''deified'', but English writers generally only cited Latin and Greek palindromic sentences in the early 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;S(ilvanus) Urban, "Classical Literature: On Macaronic Poetry", ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine|The Gentleman's Magazine, or Monthly Intelligencer'', London, [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Gentleman_s_Magazine_Or_Monthly_Intellig/ZfdfAAAAcAAJ?pg=PA35 '''100''':part 2:34-36 (New Series '''23''')] (July 1830)&lt;/ref&gt; even though [[John Taylor (poet)|John Taylor]] had coined one in 1614: "Lewd did I live, &amp;amp; evil I did dwel" (with the [[ampersand]] being something of a "fudge"&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lederer, ''The Word Circus: A Letter-perfect Book'', 1998, {{isbn|0877793549}}, p.54&lt;/ref&gt;). This is generally considered to be the first English-language palindrome sentence, and was long reputed (notably by [[James Harris (grammarian)|James "Hermes" Harris]]) to be the ''only'' one, despite many efforts to find others.&lt;ref name="nmm"&gt;"On Palindromes"
''[[The New Monthly Magazine]]'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=vP2YF5SEn9UC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172 '''2''':170-173] (July-December 1821)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gugrof"&gt;"Ingenious Arrangement of Words", ''The Gazette of the Union, Golden Rule, and Odd Fellows' Family Companion'' [https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Gazette_of_the_Union_Golden_Rule_and/qSTnAAAAMAAJ?pg=PA30 '''9''':30 (July 8, 1848)]&lt;/ref&gt; (Taylor had also composed two other, "rather indifferent", palindromic lines of poetry: "Deer Madam, Reed", "Deem if I meed".&lt;ref name="hbw"&gt;H.B. Wheatley, ''Of Anagrams: A Monograph Treating of Their History from the Earliest Ages...'', London, 1862, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DcYDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11 p. 9-11]&lt;/ref&gt;) Then in 1848, a certain "J.T.R." coined "Able was I ere I saw Elba", which became famous after it was (implausibly) attributed to [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref&gt;"Able Was I Ere I Saw Elba", ''Quote Investigator'' [https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/09/15/saw-elba/#note-7218-1 September 15, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gugrof"/&gt;

In recent history, there have been competitions related to palindromes, such as the 2012 World Palindrome Championship, set in Brooklyn, USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/3771063/mark-saltveit-world-palindrome-championship/|title="Madam, I'm Adam": Meet the World Palindrome Champion|last=Steinmetz|first=Katy|date=2015-04-04|website=Time|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Famous palindromes ===
Some well-known English palindromes are, "Able was I ere I saw [[Elba]]" (1848),&lt;ref&gt;Alluding to the first exile of [[Napoleon]] to Elba&lt;/ref&gt; "A man, a plan, a canal – Panama" (1948),&lt;ref name="MercerPanama"&gt;By Leigh Mercer, published in ''Notes and Queries,'' 13 Nov. 1948, according to ''The Yale Book of Quotations,'' F. R. Shapiro, ed. (2006, {{ISBN|0-300-10798-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt; "Madam, I'm Adam" (1861),&lt;ref&gt;''Do you give it up?: A collection of the most amusing conundrums, riddles, etc. of the day'', London, 1861, [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Do_you_give_it_up_A_collection_of_conund/tcwBAAAAQAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=%22madam%20i%20%27m%20adam%22 p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt; and "Never odd or even".

English palindromes of notable length include mathematician [[Peter Hilton]]'s "Doc, note: I dissent. A fast never prevents a fatness. I diet on cod"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Types ==

=== Characters, words, or lines ===
The most familiar palindromes in English are character-unit palindromes. The characters read the same backward as forward. Some examples of palindromic words are ''redivider'', ''deified'', ''civic'', ''radar'', ''level'', ''rotor'', ''kayak'', ''reviver'', ''racecar'', ''madam'', and ''refer''.&lt;!-- per [[WP:INDISCRIMINATE}}, please don't add further examples just because you can; these are EXAMPLES only --&gt;

There are also word-unit palindromes in which the unit of reversal is the word ("Is it crazy how saying sentences backwards creates backwards sentences saying how crazy it is?"). Word-unit palindromes were made popular in the [[Logology (linguistics)|recreational linguistics]] community by [[J. A. Lindon]] in the 1960s. Occasional examples in English were created in the 19th century. Several in French and Latin date to the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also line-unit palindromes.&lt;ref&gt;"Never Odd Or Even, and Other Tricks Words Can Do" by O.V. Michaelsen (Sterling Publishing Company: New York), 2005 p124-7&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2016}}

=== Sentences and phrases ===
[[File:Ambigram_Dogma_I_am_god.png|thumb|[[Ambigram]] of the palindrome "Dogma I am God"]]
Palindromes often consist of a sentence or phrase, e.g., "Mr. Owl ate my metal worm", "Do geese see God?", "Was it a car or a cat I saw?", "Murder for a jar of red rum" or "Go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog". Punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are usually ignored. Some, such as "Rats live on no evil star", "Live on time, emit no evil", and "Step on no pets", include the spaces.

=== Semordnilap ===
'''Semordnilap''' (palindromes spelled backward) is a name coined for words that spell a different word in reverse. The word was coined by [[Martin Gardner]] in his notes to C.C. Bombaugh's book ''Oddities and Curiosities of Words and Literature'' in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last      = Bombaugh

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this is the word ''stressed'', which is ''desserts'' spelled backward.

Some semordnilaps are deliberate creations. An example in electronics (although rarely used now) is the [[mho]], a unit of electrical conductance, which is [[ohm]] spelled backwards, the unit of [[electrical resistance]] and the reciprocal of conductance. Similarly, the [[daraf]], a unit of [[elastance]], is [[farad]] spelled backwards, the unit of [[capacitance]] and the reciprocal of elastance. In fiction, many characters have names deliberately made to be semordnilaps of other names or words, such as [[Alucard (disambiguation)|Alucard]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; (a semordnilap of "[[Dracula]]").

Semordnilaps are also known as '''emordnilaps''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also sometimes been called antigrams,&lt;ref name="anagrammy" /&gt; though this term usually refers to [[anagram]]s which have opposite meanings. As of October 2018, none of these terms have been accepted as official entries in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/latest-word-on-levidrome-oxford-says-it-s-not-ready-but-linguist-begs-to-differ-1.23462827&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Names ===
Some names are palindromes, such as the [[given name]]s Hannah, Ava, Anna, Eve, Bob and Otto, or the [[surname]]s Harrah, Renner, Salas, and Nenonen.
[[Lon Nol]] (1913–1985) was Prime Minister of Cambodia. [[Nisio Isin]] is a Japanese novelist and [[manga]] writer, whose pseudonym (西尾 維新, ''Nishio Ishin'') is a palindrome when romanized using the [[Kunrei-shiki]] or the [[Nihon-shiki]] systems, and is often written as NisiOisiN to emphasize this. Some people have changed their name in order to make it palindromic (such as actor [[Robert Trebor]] and rock-vocalist [[Ola Salo]]), while others were given a palindromic name at birth (such as the philologist [[Revilo P. Oliver]], the flamenco dancer [[Sara Baras]], and the sportswriter [[List_of_Sports_Illustrated_writers|Mark Kram]]).

There are also palindromic names in fictional media. "Stanley Yelnats" is the name of the main character in ''[[Holes (novel)|Holes]]'', a 1998 novel and [[Holes (film)|2003 film]]. Four of the fictional ''[[Pokémon]]'' [[List of Pokémon|species]] have palindromic names in English ([[Eevee]], Girafarig, Ho-Oh, and Alomomola).

The 1970s pop band [[ABBA]] is a palindrome using the starting letter of the first name of each of the four band members.

=== Numbers ===
{{Main|Palindromic number}} {{Main|Periodic continued fraction}}
A palindromic number is a number whose digits, with [[decimal]] representation usually assumed, are the same read backward, for example, 91019. They are studied in [[recreational mathematics]] where palindromic numbers with special properties are sought. A [[palindromic prime]] is a palindromic number that is a [[prime number]], for example, 191 and 313.

The [[continued fraction]] of {{sqrt|''n''}} + ⌊{{sqrt|''n''}}⌋  is a repeating palindrome when ''n'' is an integer, where essentially, for any positive ''x'', ⌊''x''⌋ denotes the [[Floor and ceiling functions|integer part]] of ''x''.

The question of whether [[Lychrel number]]s exist is an unsolved problem in mathematics about whether all numbers become palindromes when they are continuously reversed and added. For example, 56 is not a Lychrel number as 56 + 65 = 121, and 121 is a palindrome. The number 59 becomes a palindrome after three iterations: 59 + 95 = 154; 154 + 451 = 605; 605 + 506 = 1111, so 59 is not a Lychrel number either. Numbers such as 196 are thought to never become palindromes when this reversal process is carried out and are therefore suspected to be Lychrel numbers. If a number is not a Lychrel number, it is called a "delayed palindrome" (56 has a delay of 1 and 59 has a delay of 3). In January 2017 the number 1,999,291,987,030,606,810 was published in OEIS as [[oeis:A281509|A281509]], and described as "The Largest Known Most Delayed Palindrome", with a delay of 261. Several smaller 261-delay palindromes were published separately as [[oeis:A281508|A281508]].

Remarkably, a 2018 paper has demonstrated that every positive integer can be written as the sum of three palindromic numbers in every number system with base 5 or greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Cilleruelo|first=Javier|last2=Luca|first2=Florian|last3=Baxter|first3=Lewis|date=2016-02-19|title=Every positive integer is a sum of three palindromes|eprint=1602.06208|class=math.NT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A day or timestamp is a palindrome when its digits are the same when reversed. Only the digits are considered in this determination and the component separators (hyphens, slashes, and dots) are ignored. Short digits may be used as in ''[[11/11/11]] 11:11'' or long digits as in ''02/02/2020''.

A notable palindrome day is this century's 2 Feb 2020 because this date is a palindrome regardless of the [[date format by country]] (yyyy-mm-dd, dd-mm-yyyy, or mm-dd-yyyy) used in various countries. For this reason, this date has also been termed as a "Universal Palindrome Day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |display-authors= 0 |first= Susam |last= Pal |url= https://susam.in/blog/universal-palindrome-day/ |title= Universal Palindrome Day |date= Feb 2, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51349158 |title= #PalindromeDay: Geeks around the world celebrate 02/02/2020 |publisher= BBC |date= 2 Feb 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other universal palindrome days include, almost a millennium previously, ''11/11/1111'', the future ''12/12/2121'', and in a millenium ''03/03/3030''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.npr.org/2020/02/02/802015917/why-a-day-like-sunday-hasnt-been-seen-in-900-years |title= Why A Day Like Sunday Hasn't Been Seen In 900 Years |publisher= NPR |date= Feb 2, 2020 |first= Amy |last= Held }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classical music ===
[[File:Berg lulu palindrome mirror point.png|thumb|Center part of palindrome in Alban Berg's opera ''Lulu'']]
[[Joseph Haydn]]'s [[Symphony No. 47 (Haydn)|Symphony No. 47]] in G is nicknamed "the Palindrome". In the third movement, a [[minuet]] and [[trio (music)|trio]], the second half of the minuet is the same as the first but backwards, the second half of the ensuing trio similarly reflects the first half, and then the minuet is repeated.

The interlude from [[Alban Berg]]'s opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' is a palindrome, as are sections and pieces, in [[arch form]], by many other composers, including [[James Tenney]], and most famously [[Béla Bartók]]. [[George Crumb]] also used musical palindrome to text paint the [[Federico García Lorca]] poem "¿Por qué nací?", the first movement of three in his fourth book of [[Madrigal (music)|Madrigals]]. [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s final composition, ''The Owl and the Pussy Cat'', is a palindrome.&lt;ref&gt;A helpful list is at http://deconstructing-jim.blogspot.com/2010/03/musical-palindromes.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The first movement from [[Constant Lambert]]'s [[ballet]] ''[[Horoscope (ballet)|Horoscope]]'' (1938) is entitled "Palindromic Prelude". Lambert claimed that the theme was dictated to him by the ghost of [[Bernard van Dieren]], who had died in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

British composer [[Robert Simpson (composer)|Robert Simpson]] also composed music in the palindrome or based on palindromic themes; the slow movement of his [[Symphony No. 2 (Simpson)|Symphony No. 2]] is a palindrome, as is the slow movement of his [[String Quartet No. 1 (Simpson)|String Quartet No. 1]]. His hour-long [[String Quartet No. 9 (Simpson)|String Quartet No. 9]] consists of thirty-two variations and a fugue on a palindromic theme of Haydn (from the minuet of his Symphony No. 47). All of Simpson's thirty-two variations are themselves palindromic.

''Hin und Zurück'' ("There and Back": 1927) is an operatic 'sketch' (Op. 45a) in one scene by Paul Hindemith, with a German libretto by Marcellus Schiffer. It is essentially a dramatic palindrome. Through the first half, a tragedy unfolds between two lovers, involving jealousy, murder and suicide. Then, in the reversing second half, this is replayed with the lines sung in reverse order to produce a happy ending.

The music of [[Anton Webern]] is often palindromic. Webern, who had studied the music of the Renaissance composer [[Heinrich Isaac]], was extremely interested in symmetries in music, be they horizontal or vertical. An example of horizontal or linear symmetry in Webern's music is the first phrase in the second movement of the [[symphony]], Op. 21. A striking example of vertical symmetry is the second movement of the [[Variations for piano (Webern)|Piano Variations]], Op. 27, in which Webern arranges every pitch of this [[dodecaphonic]] work around the central pitch axis of A4. From this, each downward reaching interval is replicated exactly in the opposite direction. For example, a G{{Music|sharp}}3—13 half-steps down from A4 is replicated as a B{{Music|flat}}5—13 half-steps above.

Just as the letters of a verbal palindrome are not reversed, so are the elements of a musical palindrome usually presented in the same form in both halves. Although these elements are usually single notes, palindromes may be made using more complex elements. For example, [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]'s composition ''[[Mixtur]]'', originally written in 1964, consists of twenty sections, called "moments", which may be [[Permutation|permuted]] in several different ways, including retrograde presentation, and two versions may be made in a single program. When the composer revised the work in 2003, he prescribed such a palindromic performance, with the twenty moments first played in a "forwards" version, and then "backwards". Each moment, however, is a complex musical unit, and is played in the same direction in each half of the program.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Frisius, ''Karlheinz Stockhausen II: Die Werke 1950–1977; Gespräch mit Karlheinz Stockhausen, "Es geht aufwärts"'' (Mainz, London, Berlin, Madrid, New York, Paris, Prague, Tokyo, Toronto: Schott Musik International, 2008): 164–65. {{ISBN|978-3-7957-0249-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, [[Karel Goeyvaerts]]'s 1953 electronic composition, ''[[Nummer 5]] (met zuivere tonen)'' is an ''exact'' palindrome: not only does each event in the second half of the piece occur according to an axis of symmetry at the centre of the work, but each event itself is reversed, so that the note attacks in the first half become note decays in the second, and vice versa. It is a perfect example of Goeyvaerts's aesthetics, the perfect example of the imperfection of perfection.&lt;ref&gt;M[orag] J[osephine] Grant, ''Serial Music, Serial Aesthetics: Compositional Theory in Post-war Europe'' (Cambridge, U.K.; New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001): 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[classical music]], a [[crab canon]] is a [[canon (music)|canon]] in which one line of the melody is reversed in time and pitch from the other.
A large-scale musical palindrome covering more than one movement is called "chiasic", referring to the cross-shaped Greek letter "[[Chi (letter)|χ]]" (pronounced /ˈkaɪ/.)  This is usually a form of reference to the crucifixion; for example, the ''{{lang|la|[[Mass in B minor structure#Crucifixus|Crucifixus]]}}'' movement of Bach's [[Mass in B minor]]. The purpose of such palindromic balancing is to focus the listener on the central movement, much as one would focus on the center of the cross in the crucifixion. Other examples are found in Bach's cantata BWV 4, ''[[Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4|Christ lag in Todes Banden]]'', Handel's ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' and Fauré's [[Requiem (Fauré)|Requiem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A [[table canon]] is a rectangular piece of sheet music intended to be played by two musicians facing each other across a table with the music between them, with one musician viewing the music upside down compared to the other. The result is somewhat like two speakers simultaneously reading the [[Sator Square]] from opposite sides, except that it is typically in two-part polyphony rather than in unison.

== Long palindromes ==
The longest palindromic word in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is the [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] ''tattarrattat'', coined by [[James Joyce]] in ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922) for a knock on the door.&lt;ref name="Joyce1982"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Guinness Book of Records'' gives the title to ''detartrated'', the [[preterite]] and past participle of ''detartrate'', a chemical term meaning to remove [[tartrate]]s. [[Rotary tiller|Rotavator]], a trademarked name for an agricultural machine, is often listed in dictionaries. The term ''redivider'' is used by some writers, but appears to be an invented or derived term—only ''redivide'' and ''redivision'' appear in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary. ''[[Malayalam]]'', a language of southern India, is of equal length.

In English, two palindromic novels have been published: ''Satire: Veritas'' by David Stephens (1980, 58,795 letters), and ''Dr Awkward &amp; Olson in Oslo'' by Lawrence Levine (1986, 31,954 words).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Biological structures ==
{{Main|Palindromic sequence}}
[[File:DNA palindrome.svg|thumb|600px|right|Palindrome of [[DNA structure]]&lt;br /&gt;A: Palindrome, B: Loop, C: Stem]]
In most [[genome]]s or sets of [[gene]]tic instructions, palindromic motifs are found. The meaning of palindrome in the context of genetics is slightly different, however, from the definition used for words and sentences. Since the [[DNA]] is formed by two paired strands of [[nucleotides]], and the nucleotides always pair in the same way ([[Adenine]] (A) with [[Thymine]] (T), [[Cytosine]] (C) with [[Guanine]] (G)), a (single-stranded) sequence of DNA is said to be a palindrome if it is equal to its complementary sequence read backward. For example, the sequence &lt;tt&gt;ACCTAGGT&lt;/tt&gt; is palindromic because its complement is &lt;tt&gt;TGGATCCA&lt;/tt&gt;, which is equal to the original sequence in reverse complement.

A palindromic [[DNA]] sequence may form a [[stem-loop|hairpin]]. Palindromic motifs are made by the order of the [[nucleotide]]s that specify the complex chemicals ([[protein]]s) that, as a result of those [[genetics|genetic]] instructions, the [[cell (biology)|cell]] is to produce. They have been specially researched in [[bacteria]]l chromosomes and in the so-called Bacterial Interspersed Mosaic Elements (BIMEs) scattered over them. Recently{{when|date=January 2011}} a research genome sequencing project discovered that many of the bases on the [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]] are arranged as palindromes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Computation theory ==
In [[automata theory]], a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all palindromes in a given [[alphabet]] is a typical example of a [[formal language|language]] that is [[context-free language|context-free]], but not [[Regular language|regular]]. This means that it is impossible for a [[finite automaton|computer with a finite amount of memory]] to reliably test for palindromes. &lt;!-- (Must say "on one pass" because, if it were allowed random access to the data, the test becomes trivial: simply check data[n] == data[L-n] for all n up to L/2 where L is the length.) --&gt;&lt;!-- The preceding comment does not take into account that if the memory (including registers) is only M bits, the computer can only represent these values of n from 0 to 2^M-1, so consider the problem when L &gt;= 2^M. --&gt; (For practical purposes with modern computers, this limitation would apply only to impractically long letter-sequences.)

In addition, the set of palindromes may not be reliably tested by a [[deterministic pushdown automaton]] which also means that they are not [[LR parser|LR(k)-parsable]] or [[LL parser|LL(k)-parsable]]. When reading a palindrome from left-to-right, it is, in essence, impossible to locate the "middle" until the entire word has been read completely.

The '''palindromic density''' of an infinite word ''w'' over an alphabet ''A'' is defined to be zero if only finitely many prefixes are palindromes; otherwise, letting the palindromic prefixes be of lengths ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''k''=1,2,... we define the density to be

:&lt;math&gt; d_P(w) = \left( { \limsup_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n_{k+1}}{n_k} } \right)^{-1} \ . &lt;/math&gt;
