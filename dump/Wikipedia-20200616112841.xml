'''Siri''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪr|i}} {{respell|SIRR|ee}}) is a [[virtual assistant]] that is part of [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iOS]], [[iPadOS]], [[watchOS]], [[macOS]], and [[tvOS]] [[operating system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204389 |title=Use Siri on all your Apple devices |website=support.apple.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/google-assistant-beats-alexa-siri-again-in-smartphone-iq-test-2087042 |title=Google Assistant beats Alexa, Siri |website=gadgets.ndtv.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The assistant uses voice queries and a [[natural-language user interface]] to answer questions, make recommendations, and perform actions by delegating requests to a set of [[Internet]] services. The software adapts to users' individual language usages, searches, and preferences, with continuing use. Returned results are individualized.

Siri is a [[Corporate spin-off|spin-off]] from a project originally developed by the [[SRI International]] Artificial Intelligence Center. Its [[speech recognition]] engine was provided by [[Nuance Communications]], and Siri uses advanced [[machine learning]] technologies to function. Its original American, British, and Australian [[voice acting|voice actors]] recorded their respective voices around 2005, unaware of the recordings' eventual usage in Siri. The voice assistant was released as an app for iOS in February 2010, and it was acquired by Apple two months later. Siri was then integrated into [[iPhone 4S]] at its release in October 2011. At that time, the separate app was also removed from the iOS [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]. Siri has since become an integral part of Apple's products, having been adapted into other hardware devices over the years, including newer [[iPhone]] models, as well as [[iPad]], [[iPod Touch]], [[Macintosh|Mac]], [[AirPods]], [[Apple TV]], and [[HomePod]].

Siri supports a wide range of user commands, including performing phone actions, checking basic information, scheduling events and reminders, handling device settings, searching the Internet, navigating areas, finding information on entertainment, and is able to engage with iOS-integrated apps. With the release of [[iOS 10]] in 2016, Apple opened up limited third-party access to Siri, including third-party messaging apps, as well as payments, [[ride-sharing]], and [[Voice over IP|Internet calling]] apps. With the release of [[iOS 11]], Apple updated Siri's voices for more clear, human voices, started supporting follow-up questions and language translation, and additional third-party actions.

Siri's original release on [[iPhone 4S]] in 2011 received mixed reviews. It received praise for its [[Speech recognition|voice recognition]] and contextual knowledge of user information, including calendar appointments, but was criticized for requiring stiff user commands and having a lack of flexibility. It was also criticized for lacking information on certain nearby places, and for its inability to understand certain [[English accents]]. In 2016 and 2017, a number of media reports said that Siri lacked innovation, particularly against new competing voice assistants. The reports concerned Siri's limited set of features, "bad" voice recognition, and undeveloped service integrations as causing trouble for Apple in the field of [[artificial intelligence]] and cloud-based services; the basis for the complaints reportedly due to stifled development, as caused by Apple's prioritization of user [[privacy]] and executive power struggles within the company.&lt;ref name="WSJ innovation" /&gt;

== Development ==
Siri is a [[spin-out]] from the [[SRI International]] Artificial Intelligence Center, and is an offshoot of the US [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]]'s (DARPA)-funded [[CALO]] project.&lt;ref name="HuffPost origins"&gt;{{cite news |first=Biance |last=Bosker |title=SIRI RISING: The Inside Story Of Siri's Origins – And Why She Could Overshadow The iPhone |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/22/siri-do-engine-apple-iphone_n_2499165.html |newspaper=Huffington Post |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=January 24, 2013 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was co-founded by Dag Kittlaus, [[Tom Gruber]], and [[UCLA]] alumnus [[Adam Cheyer]].&lt;ref name="HuffPost origins" /&gt; Kittlaus named Siri after a co-worker in Norway, and it means "beautiful woman who leads you to victory" in Norwegian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.networkworld.com/article/2221246/steve-jobs-wasn-t-a-fan-of-the-siri-name.html|title=Steve Jobs wasn't a fan of the Siri name|last=Heisler|first=Yoni|date=2012-03-28|website=Network World|language=en|access-date=2019-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Siri's [[speech recognition]] engine was provided by [[Nuance Communications]], a speech technology company.&lt;ref name="Nuance confirmed"&gt;{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Bostic |title=Nuance confirms its voice technology is behind Apple's Siri |url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/05/30/nuance-confirms-its-technology-is-behind-apples-siri |website=AppleInsider |date=May 30, 2013 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was acknowledged by neither Apple nor Nuance for years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=MG |last=Siegler |title=Siri, Do You Use Nuance Technology?

The initial Siri prototype was implemented using the Active platform, a joint project between the Artificial Intelligence Center of [[SRI International]] and the Vrai Group at [[Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]]. The Active platform was the focus of a Ph.D. thesis led by Didier Guzzoni, who joined Siri as its chief scientist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/114758 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180604060137/https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/114758 |title=Active: a unified platform for building intelligent applications |last=Guzzoni |first=Didier |date=2008 |accessdate=June 4, 2018 |archivedate=June 4, 2018 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Siri was acquired by [[Apple Inc.]] in April 2010 under the direction of [[Steve Jobs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2011/10/06/steve-jobs-leaves-a-legacy-in-a-i-with-siri/|title=Steve Jobs Leaves A Legacy In A.I. With Siri|last=Olson|first=Parmy|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple's first notion of a digital personal assistant was originally a concept video in 1987, called the [[Knowledge Navigator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kelly |last=Hodgkins |title=Apple's Knowledge Navigator, Siri and the iPhone 4S |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/05/apples-knowledge-navigator-siri-and-the-iphone-4s/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 5, 2011 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Adam |last=Rosen |title=Apple Knowledge Navigator Video from 1987 Predicts Siri, iPad and More |url=http://www.cultofmac.com/120716/apple-knowledge-navigator-video-from-1987-predicts-siri-ipad-and-more/ |website=Cult of Mac |date=October 4, 2011 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voices ===
The original American voice of Siri was provided in July 2005 by [[Susan Bennett]], unaware that it would eventually be used for the voice assistant.&lt;ref name="McKee 2017"&gt;{{cite book |last=McKee |first=Heidi |title=Professional Communication and Network Interaction: A Rhetorical and Ethical Approach |series=Routledge Studies in Rhetoric and Communication |publisher=Taylor and Francis |publication-place=London |year=2017 |isbn=978-1-351-77077-4 |oclc=990411615 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wv8nDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA167 |access-date=1 December 2018 |page=167 |quote=Siri's voices were recorded in 2005 by a company who then licensed the voices to Apple for use in Siri.

The original British male voice was provided by [[Jon Briggs]], a former technology journalist.&lt;ref name="McKee 2017" /&gt; Having discovered that he was the voice of Siri by watching television, he first spoke only about his role in November 2011, also acknowledging his voice work was done "five or six years ago" without knowing the recordings' final usage form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Warman |title=The voice behind Siri breaks his silence |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/8879705/The-voice-behind-Siri-breaks-his-silence.html |website=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date=November 10, 2011 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Vlad |last=Savov |title=British voice of Siri only found out about it when he heard himself on TV |url=https://www.theverge.com/2011/11/10/2551519/british-voice-of-siri-only-found-out-about-it-when-he-heard-himself |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=November 10, 2011 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Australian voice was provided by [[Karen Jacobsen]], a [[voice-over]] artist known in Australia for her work as the ''[[GPS]] girl''.&lt;ref name="McKee 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian voices"&gt;{{cite news |first=Hannah Jane |last=Parkinson |title=Hey, Siri!

As part of an interview between all three voice actors and ''[[The Guardian]]'', Briggs stated that "the original system was recorded for a US company called Scansoft, who were then bought by Nuance. Apple simply licensed it."&lt;ref name="Guardian voices" /&gt;

With [[iOS 11]], Apple auditioned hundreds of candidates to find a new female voices, then recorded hours of speech, including different personalities and expressions, and built a new [[Speech synthesis|text-to-speech]] voice based on [[deep learning]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jordan |last=Kahn |title=Apple engineers share behind-the-scenes evolution of Siri &amp; more on Apple Machine Learning Journal |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/08/23/evolution-siri-machine-learning-journal/ |website=9to5Mac |date=August 23, 2017 |accessdate=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integration ==
Siri was originally released as a [[software|stand-alone application]] for the [[iOS]] operating system in February 2010, and at the time, the developers were also intending to release Siri for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[BlackBerry OS|BlackBerry]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Erick |last=Schonfeld |title=Siri's IPhone App Puts A Personal Assistant in Your Pocket |url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/04/siri-iphone-personal-assistant/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=February 4, 2010 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, Apple acquired Siri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jenna |last=Wortham |title=Apple Buys a Start-Up for Its Voice Technology |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/technology/29apple.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 29, 2010 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Katie |last=Marsal |title=Apple acquires Siri, developer of personal assistant app for iPhone |url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/10/04/28/apple_acquires_siri_developer_of_personal_assistant_app_for_iphone |website=AppleInsider |date=April 28, 2010 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Leena |last=Rao |title=Confirmed: Apple Buys Virtual Personal Assistant Startup Siri |url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/28/apple-buys-virtual-personal-assistant-startup-siri/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=April 28, 2010 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 4, 2011, Apple introduced the [[iPhone 4S]] with a [[beta version]] of Siri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jordan |last=Golson |title=Siri Voice Recognition Arrives On the iPhone 4S |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2011/10/04/siri-voice-recognition-arrives-on-the-iphone-4s/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=October 4, 2011 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Velazco |title=Apple Reveals Siri Voice Interface: The "Intelligent Assistant" Only For iPhone 4S |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/04/apple-reveals-siri-voice-interface-the-intelligent-assistant/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 4, 2011 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the announcement, Apple removed the existing standalone Siri app from [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]].&lt;ref name="TechCrunch app removal" /&gt; ''[[TechCrunch]]'' wrote that, despite the Siri app's support for [[iPhone 4]], its removal from App Store might also have had a financial aspect for the company, in providing an incentive for customers to upgrade devices.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch app removal"&gt;{{cite web |first=Greg |last=Kumparak |title=The Original Siri App Gets Pulled From The App Store, Servers To Be Killed |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/04/the-original-siri-app-gets-pulled-from-the-app-store-servers-killed/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 4, 2011 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-party developer Steven Troughton-Smith, along with 13-year-old Zak Shafi (@zshafi), however, managed to [[Porting|port]] Siri to iPhone 4, though without being able to communicate with Apple's servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mark |last=Gurman |title=Siri voice command system ported from iPhone 4S to iPhone 4 (video) |url=https://9to5mac.com/2011/10/14/siri-voice-command-system-ported-from-iphone-4s-to-iphone-4-video/ |website=9to5Mac |date=October 14, 2011 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, Shafi and Troughton-Smith, working with an anonymous person nicknamed "Chpwn", managed to fully hack Siri, enabling its full functionalities on iPhone 4 and [[iPod Touch]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mark |last=Gurman |title=Siri hacked to fully run on the iPhone 4 and iPod touch, iPhone 4S vs iPhone 4 Siri showdown video (interview) |url=https://9to5mac.com/2011/10/29/siri-hacked-to-fully-run-on-the-iphone-4-and-ipod-touch-iphone-4s-vs-iphone-4-siri-showdown-video-interview/ |website=9to5Mac |date=October 29, 2011 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shafi split from the group, founding SimplySiri with other developers to provide public access to the new founded exploit. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Zak |last=Shafi |title=Siri ported to iPhone 4 with SimplySiri (video) |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=UXMPJDYVXx4|website=YouTube |date=December 4, 2011 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Additionally, developers were also able to successfully create and distribute legal ports of Siri to any device capable of running [[iOS 5]], though a [[proxy server]] was required for Apple server interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Spire: A New Legal Siri Port For Any iOS 5 Device |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/27/spire-a-new-legal-siri-port-for-any-ios-5-device/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=December 27, 2011 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venture capital firm Mangrove Capital Partners predicted that Apple will launch a SiriOS at its developer conference in 2020 to further grow the Siri ecosystem. SiriOS could rival something like Amazon's Alexa Skills platform, which makes it easy for developers to implement Alexa functionality. Apple currently offers SiriKit to developers, but one possibility is that a SiriOS could work across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://9to5mac.com/2019/07/20/sirios-launch-2020-report/ |title=Annual ‘Voice Tech Report’ predicts Apple will launch a ‘SiriOS’ in 2020 |work=9to5mac |access-date=2019-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features and options ==
Apple offers a wide range of voice commands to interact with Siri, including, but not limited to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Sarah Jacobsson |last1=Purewal |first2=Jason |last2=Cipriani |title=The complete list of Siri commands |url=https://www.cnet.com/how-to/the-complete-list-of-siri-commands/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=February 16, 2017 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Phone and Text actions, such as "Call Sarah", "Read my new messages", "Set the timer for 10 minutes", and "Send email to mom"
* Check basic information, including "What's the weather like today?" and "How many dollars are in a Euro?"
* Schedule events and reminders, including "Schedule a meeting" and "Remind me to"
* Handle device settings, such as "Take a picture", "Turn off [[Wi-Fi]]", and "Increase the brightness"
* Search the Internet, including "Define{{nbsp}}...", "Find pictures of{{nbsp}}...", and "Search [[Twitter]] for{{nbsp}}..."

Siri also offers numerous pre-programmed responses to amusing questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How To Make Siri Sing Your Favorite Song |url=https://www.initfix.com/how-to-make-siri-sing/ |accessdate=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such questions include "What is the meaning of life?" to which Siri may reply "All evidence to date suggests it's chocolate"; "Why am I here?", to which it may reply "I don't know. Frankly, I've wondered that myself"; and "Will you marry me?", to which it may respond with "My [[End-user license agreement|End User Licensing Agreement]] does not cover marriage. My apologies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What's the Meaning of Life?

Initially limited to female voices, Apple announced in June 2013 that Siri would feature a gender option, adding a male voice counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Samantha |last=Murphy |title=Siri Gets a Male Voice |url=http://mashable.com/2013/06/10/siri-gets-male-voice/ |website=[[Mashable]] |date=June 10, 2013 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, Apple added the ability for users to speak "Hey Siri" to enable the assistant without the requirement of physically handling the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jason |last=Cipriani |title=What you need to know about 'Hey, Siri' in iOS 8 |url=https://www.cnet.com/how-to/what-you-need-to-know-about-hey-siri-in-ios-8/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=September 18, 2014 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, the "Hey Siri" feature was updated to include individualized voice recognition, a presumed effort to prevent non-owner activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mitchel |last=Broussard |title=Apple's 'Hey Siri' Feature in iOS 9 Uses Individualized Voice Recognition |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2015/09/11/apples-hey-siri-feature-voice/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=September 11, 2015 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Tofel |title=Apple adds individual voice recognition to "Hey Siri" in iOS 9 |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-adds-individual-voice-recognition-to-hey-siri-in-ios-9/ |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=September 11, 2015 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the announcement of [[iOS 10]] in June 2016, Apple opened up limited third-party developer access to Siri through a dedicated [[application programming interface]] (API). The API restricts usage of Siri to engaging with third-party messaging apps, payment apps, ride-sharing apps, and Internet calling apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Husain |last=Sumra |title=Apple Opens Siri to Third-Party Developers With iOS 10 |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2016/06/13/apple-siri-api-third-party-developers/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=June 13, 2016 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nathan |last=Olivarez-Giles |title=Apple iOS 10 Opens Up Siri and Messages, Updates Music, Photos and More |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-ios-10-opens-up-siri-and-messages-updates-music-photos-and-more-1465851484 |website=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] |date=June 13, 2016 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[iOS 11]], Siri is able to handle follow-up questions, supports language translation, and opens up to more third-party actions, including task management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Lucas |last=Matney |title=Siri gets language translation and a more human voice |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/siri-gets-voice-translation-and-a-more-human-voice/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 5, 2017 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chaim |last=Gartenberg |title=Siri on iOS 11 gets improved speech and can suggest actions based on how you use it |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15732136/apple-siri-update-announced-new-features-wwdc-2017 |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 5, 2017 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, users are able to type to Siri,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sean |last=O'Kane |title=The 9 best iOS 11 features Apple didn't talk about onstage |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15742046/apple-ios-11-features-updates-siri-wwdc-2017 |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 5, 2017 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a new, privacy-minded "on-device learning" technique improves Siri's suggestions by privately analyzing personal usage of different iOS applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Welch |title=Apple announces iOS 11 with new features and better iPad productivity |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15732070/apple-ios-11-announced-iphone-update-new-features-wwdc-2017 |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 5, 2017 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Siri received mixed reviews during its beta release as an integrated part of iPhone 4S in October 2011.

MG Siegler of ''[[TechCrunch]]'' wrote that Siri was "great," praising the potential for Siri after losing the beta tag: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The amount of times Siri hasn't been able to understand and execute my request is astonishingly low.{{nbsp}}... Just imagine what will happen when Apple partners with other services to expand Siri further. And imagine when they have an API that any developer can use. This really could alter the mobile landscape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=MG |last=Siegler |title=The iPhone 4S: Faster, More Capable, And You Can Talk To It |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/11/iphone-4s-review/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 11, 2011 |accessdate=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[David Pogue]] also praised Siri's [[natural language understanding|language understanding]] and ability to understand context: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[Siri] thinks for a few seconds, displays a beautifully formatted response and speaks in a calm female voice.{{nbsp}}... It's mind-blowing how inexact your utterances can be. Siri understands everything from, 'What's the weather going to be like in Tucson this weekend?' to 'Will I need an umbrella tonight?'{{nbsp}}... Once, I tried saying, 'Make an appointment with Patrick for Thursday at 3.' Siri responded, 'Note that you already have an all-day appointment about "Boston Trip" for this Thursday. Shall I schedule this anyway?' Unbelievable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Pogue |authorlink=David Pogue |title=New iPhone Conceals Sheer Magic |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/technology/personaltech/iphone-4s-conceals-sheer-magic-pogue.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 11, 2011 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jacqui Cheng of ''[[Ars Technica]]'' wrote that Apple's claims of what Siri could do were bold, and the early demos "even bolder": &lt;blockquote&gt;"Though Siri shows real potential, these kinds of high expectations are bound to be disappointed.{{nbsp}}... Apple makes clear that the product is still in beta—an appropriate label, in our opinion."&lt;ref name="cheng2011" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; While praising its ability to "decipher our casual language" and deliver "very specific and accurate result," sometimes even providing additional information, Cheng noted and criticized its restrictions, particularly when the language moved away from "stiffer commands" into more human interactions. One example included the phrase "Send a text to Jason, Clint, Sam, and Lee saying we're having dinner at Silver Cloud," which Siri interpreted as sending a message to Jason only, containing the text "Clint Sam and Lee saying we're having dinner at Silver Cloud." She also noted a lack of proper editability, as saying "Edit message to say: We're at Silver Cloud and you should come find us," generated "Clint Sam and Lee saying we're having dinner at Silver Cloud to say we're at Silver Cloud and you should come find us."&lt;ref name="cheng2011"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jacqui |last=Cheng |title=iPhone 4S: A Siri-ously slick, speedy smartphone |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/10/iphone-4s-a-siri-ously-slick-speedy-smartphone/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=October 18, 2011 |accessdate=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Google]]'s executive chairman and former chief, [[Eric Schmidt]], conceded that Siri could pose a competitive threat to the company's core search business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Emma |last=Barnett |title=Google's Eric Schmidt: Apple's Siri could pose 'threat' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/eric-schmidt/8873664/Googles-Eric-Schmidt-Apples-Siri-could-pose-threat.html |website=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date=November 7, 2011 |accessdate=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Siri was criticized by [[Abortion-rights movements|pro-abortion rights organizations]], including the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]], after users found that Siri could not provide information about the location of birth control or abortion providers nearby, sometimes directing users to [[crisis pregnancy center]]s instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dominic |last=Rushe |title=Siri's abortion bias embarrasses Apple as it rues 'unintentional omissions' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/dec/01/siri-abortion-apple-unintenional-omissions |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=December 1, 2011 |accessdate=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jared |last=Newman |title=Siri Is Pro-Life, Apple Blames a Glitch |url=http://techland.time.com/2011/12/01/siri-is-pro-life-apple-blames-a-glitch/ |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 1, 2011 |accessdate=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John D. |last=Sutter |title=Siri can't direct you to an abortion clinic |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/01/tech/mobile/abortion-clinic-siri-iphone/ |website=[[CNN]] |date=December 1, 2011 |accessdate=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natalie Kerris, a spokeswoman for Apple, told ''The New York Times'': &lt;blockquote&gt;"Our customers want to use Siri to find out all types of information, and while it can find a lot, it doesn't always find what you want.{{nbsp}}... These are not intentional omissions meant to offend anyone. It simply means that as we bring Siri from beta to a final product, we find places where we can do better, and we will in the coming weeks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jenna |last=Wortham |title=Apple Says Siri's Abortion Answers Are a Glitch |url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/apple-says-siris-abortion-answers-are-a-glitch/ |website=Bits |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 30, 2011 |accessdate=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 2016, ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' reported that, in then-recent months, Siri had begun to confuse the word "abortion" with "[[adoption]]", citing "health experts" who stated that the situation had "gotten worse." However, at the time of ''Fast Company''{{'}}s report, the situation had changed slightly, with Siri offering "a more comprehensive list of [[Planned Parenthood]] facilities", although "Adoption clinics continue to pop up, but near the bottom of the list."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Christina |last=Farr |title=Apple Maps Stops Sending People Searching For "Abortion" To Adoption Centers |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3055887/apple-maps-stops-sending-people-searching-for-abortion-to-adoption-centers |website=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |publisher=Mansueto Ventures |date=January 28, 2016 |accessdate=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mikey |last=Campbell |title=Apple correcting Siri "abortion" search issue uncovered in 2011 |url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/01/29/apple-correcting-siri-abortion-search-issue-uncovered-in-2011 |website=AppleInsider |date=January 29, 2016 |accessdate=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Siri has also not been well received by some English speakers with distinctive accents, including [[Scottish English|Scottish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Henry |last=Chu |title=Scottish burr beyond Siri's recognition |url=http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/scottish-burr-beyond-siris-recognition-20120203-1qwuy.html |website=[[The Age]] |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |date=February 4, 2012 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Americans from [[Boston accent|Boston]] or the [[Southern American English|South]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Lauren |last=Effron |title=iPhone 4S's Siri Is Lost in Translation With Heavy Accents |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/siri-lost-translation-heavy-accents/story?id=14834111 |website=[[ABC News]] |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date=October 28, 2011 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Frank M. Fazio filed a class action lawsuit against Apple on behalf of the people who bought iPhone 4S and felt misled about the capabilities of Siri, alleging its failing to function as depicted in Apple's Siri commercials. Fazio filed the lawsuit in California and claimed that the iPhone 4S was merely a "more expensive iPhone 4" if Siri fails to function as advertised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Meghan |last=Kelly |title=Siri ads "false and misleading," according to class action lawsuit |url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/03/13/siri-apple-law-suit/ |website=[[VentureBeat]] |date=March 13, 2012 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Palazzolo |title=So Sirious: iPhone User Sues Apple over Voice-Activated Assistant |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2012/03/12/so-sirious-iphone-user-sues-apple-over-voice-activated-assistant/ |website=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] |date=March 12, 2012 |accessdate=June 10, 2017}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 22, 2013, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken in San Francisco dismissed the suit but said the plaintiffs could amend at a later time.

In June 2016, ''[[The Verge]]''{{'}}s Sean O'Kane wrote about the then-upcoming major iOS 10 updates, with a headline stating "Siri's big upgrades won't matter if it can't understand its users": &lt;blockquote&gt;"What Apple didn't talk about was solving Siri's biggest, most basic flaws: it's still not very good at voice recognition, and when it gets it right, the results are often clunky. And these problems look even worse when you consider that Apple now has full-fledged competitors in this space: [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]], [[Microsoft]]'s [[Cortana (software)|Cortana]], and Google's [[Google Assistant|Assistant]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sean |last=O'Kane |title=Siri's big upgrades won't matter if it can't understand its users |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/14/11925076/siri-apple-wwdc-ios-updates-voice-recognition |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 14, 2016 |accessdate=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Also writing for ''The Verge'', [[Walt Mossberg]] had previously questioned Apple's efforts in cloud-based services, writing:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Walt |last=Mossberg |title=Mossberg: Can Apple win the next tech war? |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/25/11765624/walt-mossberg-apple-wwdc-2016-siri-ai-bots |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=May 25, 2016 |accessdate=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...{{nbsp}}perhaps the biggest disappointment among Apple's cloud-based services is the one it needs most today, right now: Siri. Before Apple bought it, Siri was on the road to being a robust digital assistant that could do many things, and integrate with many services—even though it was being built by a startup with limited funds and people. After Apple bought Siri, the giant company seemed to treat it as a backwater, restricting it to doing only a few, slowly increasing a number of tasks, like telling you the weather, sports scores, movie and restaurant listings, and controlling the device's functions. Its unhappy founders have left Apple to build a new AI service called [[Viv (software)|Viv]]. And, on too many occasions, Siri either gets things wrong, doesn't know the answer, or can't verbalize it. Instead, it shows you a web search result, even when you're not in a position to read it."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In October 2016, ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'' reported that Apple had plans to unify the teams behind its various cloud-based services, including a single campus and reorganized cloud computing resources aimed at improving the processing of Siri's queries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mark |last=Gurman |title=Apple Said to Plan Improved Cloud Services by Unifying Teams |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-06/apple-is-said-to-plan-improved-cloud-services-by-unifying-teams |website=Bloomberg Technology |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=October 6, 2016 |accessdate=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; although another report from ''The Verge'', in June 2017, once again called Siri's voice recognition "bad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sean |last=O'Kane |title=Apple still hasn't fixed Siri's biggest problem |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/7/15742936/apple-siri-problems-voice-recognition-wwdc-2017 |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 7, 2017 |accessdate=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' published an extensive report on the lack of innovation with Siri following competitors' advancement in the field of voice assistants. Noting that Apple workers' anxiety levels "went up a notch" on the announcement of Amazon's Alexa, the ''Journal'' wrote: "Today, Apple is playing catch-up in a product category it invented, increasing worries about whether the technology giant has lost some of its innovation edge." The report gave the primary causes being Apple's prioritization of user privacy, including randomly-tagged six-month Siri searches, whereas Google and Amazon keep data until actively discarded by the user and executive power struggles within Apple. Apple did not comment on the report, while [[Eddy Cue]] said: "Apple often uses generic data rather than user data to train its systems and has the ability to improve Siri's performance for individual users with information kept on their iPhones."&lt;ref name="WSJ innovation"&gt;{{cite web |first=Tripp |last=Mickle |title='I'm Not Sure I Understand'—How Apple's Siri Lost Her Mojo |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-siri-once-an-original-now-struggles-to-be-heard-above-the-crowd-1496849095 |website=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] |date=June 7, 2017 |accessdate=2017-06-10}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tim |last=Hardwick |title=Apple's Concern With User Privacy Reportedly Stifling Siri Development |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/08/apple-struggling-to-develop-siri-privacy/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=June 8, 2017 |accessdate=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Swearing ==
The iOS version of Siri ships with a vulgar content filter; however, it is disabled by default and must be enabled by the user manually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://osxdaily.com/2017/12/28/disable-explicit-language-siri-ios/ |title=How to Disable Bad Language in Siri on iPhone and iPad |date=2017-12-28 |work=OS X Daily |access-date=2018-05-05 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if Siri can be triggered into cursing, broadcasting discriminatory content, and so on, the actions will most likely be carried out. Over its history, multiple methods and techniques have been used to trigger Siri into swearing. The language-filter is not perfect and can still be bypassed.

In 2018, [[Ars Technica]] reported a new glitch that could be exploited by a user requesting the definition of "mother" be read out loud. Siri would issue a response and ask the user if they would like to hear the next definition; when the user replies with "yes," Siri would mention "mother" as being short for "motherfucker."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/04/iphones-weirdest-glitch-yet-ask-siri-to-define-mother-twice-learn-a-bad-word/ |title=iPhone's weirdest glitch yet: Ask Siri to define "mother" twice, learn a bad word |work=Ars Technica |access-date=2018-04-29 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in multiple [[YouTube]] videos featuring the responses and/or how to trigger them. Apple fixed the issue silently, although it is unconfirmed if the videos specifically brought it to their attention. The content is picked up from third-party sources such as the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] and not a supplied message from the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.news18.com/news/tech/apple-iphone-siri-mother-caught-cursing-on-an-fixes-the-bug-silently-1734967.html |title=Siri Caught Cursing on an iPhone; Apple Fixes The Bug Silently |work=News18 |access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown whether this glitch was exploited with the vulgar content filter enabled.
