{{About||the album by The Agonist|Eye of Providence (album)|the type of Orthodox icon|Eye of Providence (icon)|Eye of God|Eye of God (disambiguation)||}}
{{Redirect|All-seeing eye}}The '''Eye of Providence''' (or the '''all-seeing eye of God''') is a [[symbol]]—used in various religions (and other institutions)—that depicts an eye, often enclosed by a [[triangle]] and surrounded by [[Ray (optics)|rays]] of [[light]], or [[Glory (religion)#Glory in art|glory]], meant to represent the concept of [[divine providence|''divine providence'']], whereby the eye of [[God]] watches over [[human]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-saints.info/catholic-symbols/eye-christian-symbol.htm|title=The eye as a Christian symbol|website=catholic-saints.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/symbols/eye_of_god.htm|title=The Eye as a religious symbol|website=Religiousfacts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasonry.bcy.ca/symbolism/eye.html|title=Freemasonry and the All-seeing Eye|website=Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Human history#Modern history|modern era]], a well-recognized depiction of the eye is that on the reverse of the [[Great Seal of the United States]], which appears on the [[United States one-dollar bill|U.S. one-dollar bill]]. 

== Use by governments and confederations ==

=== United States ===
[[File:SealOfTheUS Prototype.png|thumb|Original design for the [[Great Seal of the United States]] by [[Pierre Eugene du Simitiere|Simitiere]]]][[File:Coat of Arms of Brasłaŭ, Belarus.svg|thumb|Coat of arms of [[Braslaw]], [[Belarus]]|262x262px]]In 1782, the Eye of Providence was adopted as part of the [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] featured on the reverse side of the [[Great Seal of the United States]]. It was first proposed as an element of the Great Seal by the first of three design committees in 1776, and is thought to be the suggestion of the artistic consultant, [[Pierre Eugene du Simitiere]].&lt;ref name="GSUSbooklet"&gt;[[Bureau of Public Affairs]]. July 2003. "[https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/27807.pdf The Great Seal of the United States]." Washington: [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State Archive]];

See also "[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/rls/dos/9087.htm Great Seal]." Bureau of Public Affairs. 2002. Both retrieved 6 June 2020.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his original proposal to the committee, Du Simitiere placed the Eye over [[Coat of arms|shields]] so as to symbolize each of the original [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen states of the Union]]. On the version of the seal that would eventually be approved, the Eye is positioned above an unfinished [[pyramid]] of thirteen steps (again symbolizing the original States, but also incorporating the nation's potential for future growth). Such symbolism is explained through the motto that appears above the Eye, ''[[annuit cœptis]]'', meaning "He approves [our] undertakings" (or "has approved").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greatseal.com/mottoes/coeptis.html|title=Annuit Coeptis - History of Motto Above Great Seal's Eye of Providence|website=greatseal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greatseal.com/symbols/thirteen.html|title=Thirteen - America's Number On the Great Seal of the United States|website=greatseal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps due to its use in the design of the Great Seal, the Eye has made its way into other American seals and logos, such as, for example:

*The [[Seal of Colorado]]
* The [[List of United States county and city insignia|city seal]] of [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]], [[Wisconsin]]
*[[DARPA]]'s [[Information Awareness Office]]

==== U.S. Currency ====
The Eye of Providence has been used among various forms currency throughout U.S. history, including:

*the [[United States one-dollar bill]], as part of the Great Seal
* the [[Vermont copper|Vermont Copper]]
*[[Nova Constellatio]] patterns of 1783&lt;ref&gt;Spurrier, Lianna. 7 November 2018. "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bVMPYc17rc Lost &amp; Found: The Nova Constellatio Set]" (video, 5:40). ''[[YouTube]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lithuania ===
The Eye of Providence appears on several [[Lithuania|Lithuanian]] insignia, including:

*The Coat of Arms of [[Alovė]]
*The Coat of Arms of [[Baisogala]]
*The Coat of Arms of [[Kalvarija, Lithuania|Kalvarija]]
*The Coat of Arms and Flag of [[Plungė]]
* The Coat of Arms and Flag of [[Šiauliai]]

=== Other countries ===
[[File:Bandeira da Confedereção do Equador.png|thumb|The Eye as depicted in the palm featured on the flag of the [[Confederation of the Equator]].|alt=|217x217px]]The Eye of Providence appears on the [[Coat of arms|Coat of Arms]] of [[Braslaw|Brasłaŭ]], [[Belarus]], and of [[Wilamowice]], [[Poland]]. The Eye was also part of the flag and coat of arms adopted by the [[Confederation of the Equator]], a short lived 1824 [[Secession|secessionist revolt]] in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern provinces]] of [[Brazil]]. In the [[United Kingdom]], the symbol was part of the [[Guards Division (United Kingdom)|Guards Division]] insignia, created in 1915.

In [[Estonia]], the [[50 krooni]] note shows the Eye as part of a depiction of the [[pipe organ]] of the [[Käina]] church. Likewise, the (old) 500 [[Ukrainian hryvnia]] note also depicts the Eye.

The Eye was included in the original publication of France's [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], which also borrows [[iconography]] from the [[Ten Commandments]]. Similarly, the symbol is featured on the front page of the [[Constitution of Serbia]] from 1835.

== Freemasonry ==
[[File:MasonicEyeOfProvidence.gif|thumb|An early [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] version of the Eye, with clouds and a semi-circular [[Glory (religion)|glory]].|alt=An early Masonic version of the Eye of Providence with clouds and a semi-circular glory|left]]
Today, the Eye of Providence is often associated with [[Freemasonry]], first appearing as part of the standard Freemason [[iconography]] in 1797 with the publication of [[Thomas Smith Webb]]'s ''Freemasons Monitor''.&lt;ref&gt;[[S. Brent Morris|Morris, S. Brent]]. 13 January 2010. "[http://web.mit.edu/dryfoo/Masons/Essays/eyepyr.html The Eye in the Pyramid]." ''Short Talk Bulletin''. Silver Spring, MD: [[Masonic Service Association]]. Retrieved 6 June 2020.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Smith Webb|Webb, Thomas Smith]]. [1791] 1821. ''The Freemasons Monitor or Illustrations of Masonry''. Salem, MA: Cushing and Appleton. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In this use, the Eye, representing the [[Omniscience|all-seeing]] eye of [[God]], serves as a reminder that humanity's thoughts and deeds are always observed by God—who is referred to in Masonry as the [[Great Architect of the Universe]]. Typically, the Masonic Eye of Providence has a [[Semicircle|semicircular]] [[Glory (religion)|glory]] below it, and is sometimes enclosed by a [[triangle]].

Popular among [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]] is the claim that the Eye of Providence shown atop an unfinished [[pyramid]] on the [[Great Seal of the United States]] indicates the influence of Freemasonry in the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding of the United States]]. However, common Masonic use of the Eye dates to 14 years after the creation of the Great Seal. Furthermore, the only [[Freemasonry in the Americas|Mason]] among the members of the various design committees for the Great Seal was [[Benjamin Franklin]], whose ideas for the seal were not adopted. Likewise, various Masonic organizations have explicitly denied any connection to the creation of the Seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/anti-masonry02.html#eye_pyramid|website=Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon|title=Anti-masonry Frequently Asked Questions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/masonic_dollar.html|website=Pietre-Stones Review of Freemasonry|title=The "Masonic" One Dollar: Fact or Fiction?|first=David, W.Bro.|last=Barrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in religion ==

=== Christianity ===
The association of an eye with the concept of [[Divine Providence]] is found in [[Christianity]]. In [[Renaissance|Renaissance European]] [[iconography]], the Eye, surrounded by a triangle, was an explicit image of the Christian [[Trinity]].{{Failed verification|date=July 2018|reason=the source provided explicitly connects this to Christianity only in the 18th century, not the renaissance.}}  Seventeenth-century depictions of the Eye sometimes show it surrounded by clouds or [[sunburst]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Potts|first=Albert M.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rFvu92GyDQoC&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The World's Eye|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=1982|isbn=978-0-8131-3130-6|pages=68–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eye of God in a triangle is still used in [[church architecture]] and [[Christian art]] to symbolize the Trinity and God's [[omnipresence]] and divine providence.

The Eye of Providence is notably featured on the following Christian buildings, among others:

*The [[Kazan Cathedral, Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]
* The [[Salt Lake Temple]], [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]
*[[Jesuit Church, Mannheim]], [[Germany]]

=== Eastern religion ===
The Eye of Providence is a symbol found in [[Hinduism]], particularly throughout the path of [[Sanātanī|Sanātanī dharma]], and is the component part of drawing many [[Yantra|''yantras'']], which are invoked for various purposes. For example, in the [[Yoga#History|ancient yoga]], the symbol is drawn with specific [[Vedas|Vedic]] [[Mantra|mantras]] in order to purify the seat of the [[yogi]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Satyananda Saraswati|Saraswati, Satyananda]], and Vittalananda Saraswati. [1998] 2015. ''Siva Puja and Advanced Yajna''. Temple of the Divine Mother, Inc. {{ISBN|9781887472623}}. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Buddhism]], the Eye belongs to [[Abhijñā]], one of the higher powers, and can be achieved during [[samadhi|''samadhi'']], or intensive [[Meditation|meditative]] concentration. What is known in [[Pali]] as ''Dibba-cakkhu'', meaning Divine Eye or Divine Vision, allows one to see into the working law of [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]. One can 'see' knowing others' karmic destinations; [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|death and subsequent rebirth]].

In [[Caodaism|Đạo Cao Đài]] (Caodaism), the Eye of Providence, known as "The Divine Eye," convinces believers that God witnesses everything, everywhere, continuously.

== Miscellaneous uses ==
Commonly in the context of a reference to the '''[[Illuminati]]''', numerous video games, TV shows, films, books, and websites contain depictions of the Eye.

=== University and college insignia ===
Several universities and college [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities]] use the Eye of Providence in their coats of arms, seals, or badges, notably: 

* [[Delta Tau Delta]], based in [[Bethany, West Virginia|Bethany]], [[West Virginia]]
* [[Phi Kappa Psi]], based in [[Canonsburg, Pennsylvania]] 
* [[Phi Delta Theta]], based in [[Oxford, Ohio]]. 
* [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]], based in [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]]

* The [[University of Chile]], [[Santiago]], [[Chile]]
* The [[University of Mississippi]], [[Oxford, Mississippi|Oxford]], [[Mississippi]]
