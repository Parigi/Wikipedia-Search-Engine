=== WWDC 2012 (June 11–15, 2012) ===

WWDC 2012 was held in Moscone Center West from June 11 to 15. The ticket price remained the same as the 2010 WWDC, selling at US$1,599. Apple changed the purchasing process by requiring purchases to be made using an Apple ID associated with a paid Apple developer account. Tickets went on sale shortly after 8:30am Eastern Time on Wednesday April 25, 2012, and were sold out within 1 hour and 43 minutes. The keynote highlighted the launch of [[Apple Maps]], and also announced new models of the [[MacBook Air]] and [[MacBook Pro]] including one with [[Retina Display]]. Apple also showcased [[OS X Mountain Lion]] and [[iOS 6]].

In prior years, attendees were required to be at least 18 years old. In 2012, Apple changed this requirement to at least 13 years after a minor who was "accidentally" awarded a student scholarship in 2011 successfully petitioned Tim Cook to retain the award. Despite the change, Beer Bash attendees were still required to be 18 years old, and 21 years old to consume alcohol, in accord with local and federal laws. [[Neon Trees]] performed at the WWDC Bash.

This keynote was streamed live exclusively on iOS devices and OS X, through the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser on June 11, 2012.

=== Apple Special Event (September 12, 2012) ===
[[Phil Schiller]], Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, took the wraps off the new [[iPhone]] for press gathered at the company's San Francisco event, calling the device "the most beautiful product we've ever made, bar none." The [[iPhone 5]] is made entirely of glass and aluminum, Schiller said, adding that the "exacting level of standards" exhibited by the phone is Apple's best hardware engineering to date.

It's the thinnest and lightest iPhone, at 7.6mm thin, and 112 grams. Schiller said those measurements make it the world's thinnest smartphone. The [[iPhone 5]] was also volumetrically smaller than the previous model, the [[iPhone 4S]].

=== Apple Special Event (October 23, 2012) ===
On October 23, Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the new [[iPad Mini (1st generation)|iPad Mini]], [[iPad 4|fourth generation iPad]] with Retina display, new [[iMac]], and the 13-inch [[MacBook Pro]] with Retina display.
