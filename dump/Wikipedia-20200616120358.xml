The '''[[Great Recession]] in Russia''' was a crisis during 2008–2009 in the [[Russia]]n financial markets as well as an economic recession that was compounded by political fears after the [[2008 South Ossetian war|war with Georgia]] and by the plummeting price of Urals heavy [[Price of petroleum|crude oil]], which lost more than 70% of its value since its record peak of US$147 on 4 July 2008 before rebounding moderately in 2009. According to the [[World Bank]], Russia’s strong short-term [[macroeconomic]] fundamentals made it better prepared than many [[emerging economies]] to deal with the crisis, but its underlying structural weaknesses and high dependence on the price of a single commodity made its impact more pronounced than would otherwise be the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTRUSSIANFEDERATION/Resources/rer17_eng.pdf | title = Russian economic report | number = 171 | publisher = [[World Bank]] | accessdate = 12 August 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2008 during the onset of the crisis, Russian markets plummeted and more than $1&amp;nbsp;trillion had been wiped off the value of Russia's shares,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-CreditCrisis/idUSTRE4AC5M020081113 |agency = Reuters | title= Russian stocks shed over trillion in crisis | date= 13 November 2008| accessdate = 28 November 2008 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090109212019/https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-CreditCrisis/idUSTRE4AC5M020081113 | archivedate = 9 January 2009| url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Russian stocks rebounded in 2009 becoming the world’s best performers, with the [[MICEX Index]] having more than doubled in value and regaining half its 2008 losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aR48z1j0bBrU | title = Russian Stocks Cut to 'Neutral' at JPMorgan on Commodity Risks | publisher = [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] | accessdate = 16 December 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the crisis progressed, [[Reuters]] and the [[Financial Times]] speculated that the crisis would be used to increase the Kremlin's control over key strategic assets in a reverse of the "loans for shares" sales of the 1990s, when the state sold off major assets to the [[business oligarch|oligarch]]s in return for loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSLA60378720081013 |agency=Reuters |title=Kremlin holds key as crisis threatens oligarchs |date=13 October 2008 |accessdate=29 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218191443/https://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSLA60378720081013 |archivedate=18 December 2008 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to this earlier speculation, in September 2009 the Russian government announced plans to sell state energy and transport holdings in order to help plug the [[Federal budget of Russia|budget deficit]] and to help improve the nation's aging infrastructure. The state [[Earmark (politics)|earmarked]] about 5,500 enterprises for [[divestment]] and plans to sell shares in companies that are already publicly traded, including [[Rosneft]], the country’s biggest oil producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=agAUNSXARKTk | title = Russia's Planned State Asset Sales to Outshine Pee | publisher = [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] | accessdate = 16 December 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From July 2008 – January 2009, Russia's [[foreign exchange reserves]] (FXR) fell by $210&amp;nbsp;billion from their peak to $386&amp;nbsp;billion as the central bank adopted a policy of gradual devaluation to combat the sharp devaluation of the [[Russian ruble|ruble]]. The ruble weakened 35% against the dollar from the onset of the crisis in August to January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aPzxsrEg7GUc | publisher = [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |title=Ruble Gain Versus Dollar 'Inevitable,' Zadornov Says| accessdate = 16 December 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As the ruble stabilized in January the reserves began to steadily grow again throughout 2009, reaching a year-long high of $452&amp;nbsp;billion by year's-end.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.easybourse.com/bourse-actualite/accor/press-release-fitch-downgrades-russia-to-bbb-FR0000120404-609688 Fitch Downgrades Russia To BBB] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130121204915/http://www.easybourse.com/bourse-actualite/accor/press-release-fitch-downgrades-russia-to-bbb-FR0000120404-609688 |date=21 January 2013 }}, Dow Jones (via Easy Bourse), 4 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=RUREFEG:IND Russian foreign reserves] [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] Retrieved on 16 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Russia is a major exporter of commodities such as oil and metals, so its economy had been hit hard&lt;ref name=badnews&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.stratfor.com/memberships/124716/analysis/20081003_global_market_brief_implications_russias_declining_oil_production | title = The Implications of Russia's Declining Oil Production | publisher = [[Stratfor]] | date = 3 October 2008 | access-date = 12 October 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081009030540/http://www.stratfor.com/memberships/124716/analysis/20081003_global_market_brief_implications_russias_declining_oil_production | archive-date = 9 October 2008 | url-status = dead }}.&lt;/ref&gt; by the decline in the price of many commodities.  The Russian stock market declined significantly.  Foreign investors had pulled billions of dollars out of Russia on concerns over escalating geopolitical tensions with the West following the military conflict between Georgia and Russia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080817/116091756.html | title = South Ossetia conflict wipes $7bln off Russian market – Kudrin | publisher = [[RIA Novosti]] | place = [[Russia|RU]] | date = 17 August 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as concerns about state interference in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/04/news/international/powell_KGB.fortune/ |publisher=CNN | first=Bill | last=Powell | title=How the KGB (and friends) took over Russia's economy | date=9 September 2008| accessdate= 12 October 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081013184508/http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/04/news/international/powell_KGB.fortune/| archivedate= 13 October 2008| url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those concerns were underscored in July by Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]]'s criticism of steel company [[Mechel]] collapsing the company's stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.russiaprofile.org/page.php?pageid=Business&amp;articleid=a1218030204 | title = No Time to Panic | first = Sergi | last = Balashov | publisher = Russia profile | date = 6 August 2008 | access-date = 12 October 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080817152652/http://www.russiaprofile.org/page.php?pageid=Business&amp;articleid=a1218030204 | archive-date = 17 August 2008 | url-status = dead }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.theotherrussia.org/2008/07/29/putin-and-russias-collapsing-stock-market/ | title = Putin and Russia's Collapsing Stock Market | first = Yulia | last = Latynina | author-link = Yulia Latynina | publisher = The other Russia | date = 29 July 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2008/09/22/afx5454115.html | title = Russia's Medvedev gives boost to Mechel's owner | newspaper = [[Forbes]] | date = 22 September 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2008/07/understanding_the_attack_on_me.htm | title = Understanding the Attack on Mechel | first = Robert | last = Amsterdam | author-link = Robert Amsterdam | date = 29 July 2008 | access-date = 12 October 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205015941/http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2008/07/understanding_the_attack_on_me.htm | archive-date = 5 December 2008 | url-status = dead }}.&lt;/ref&gt; By September 2008, the RTS stock index plunged almost 54%, making it one of the worst performing markets in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/financial-turmoil-accelerates-russia/story.aspx?guid=%7BAD559BFE%2D5E6C%2D4033%2D87C6%2D36EA9D4DFA18%7D | title = Financial turmoil accelerates in Russia | newspaper = MarketWatch | date = 17 September 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Russian involvement in the US [[subprime mortgage crisis]] contributed to the volatility in Russia's financial system. The [[Central Bank of Russia|Russian Central Bank]] owned US$100&amp;nbsp;Billion of [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] of the two American mortgage giants [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] that were [[Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac|taken over by the US government]]. This investment appeared to be bound for write-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Julian |last= Delasantellis |title= Paulson placates China, Russia – for now | url = http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Global_Economy/JI10Dj03.html |work=[[Asia Times Online]] |date= 9 September 2008|accessdate=17 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many analysts, including [[Andrei Illarionov]], former economic policy adviser to then-President Vladimir Putin, claim that in Russia the crisis in the stock market was deepened dramatically by internal factors, including concerns over state interference in the economy fueled in June by Putin's criticism of [[Mechel]] and the conflict over [[TNK-BP]], lack of transparency in banking and political risks associated with escalating geopolitical tensions following the [[2008 South Ossetia war]] in August.&lt;ref name ="illarionov"&gt;{{Citation | first = Andrei | last = Illarionov | url = http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/1016/42/371419.htm | title = Fighting Financial Fires With Blini | newspaper = [[The Moscow Times]] | date = 3 October 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Sweden)|Swedish Foreign minister]] [[Carl Bildt]] said on 17 September that the current Russian financial crisis is "obviously more worrying" than the ongoing [[subprime mortgage crisis]] in view of the political development in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language = sv | url = http://di.se/Avdelningar/Artikel.aspx?stat=0&amp;ArticleID=2008%5c09%5c17%5c301279&amp;SectionId=Ettan&amp;menusection=Startsidan;Huvudnyheter | title = Carl Bildt bloggar om krisen |trans-title=Carl Bildt blogs about crisis | newspaper = Dagens industri | date = 17 September 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Russia's overt reliance on the oil and natural gas sector made it particularly vulnerable.

According to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' and [[Gazeta.ru]], as the Russian market declined in September, a conspiracy theory circulated within Russian leadership that the U.S. government had incited American investors to withdraw their capital from Russia, in punishment for the war in Georgia.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;{{Citation | first = Gregory L | last = White | title = Russian Rescue Package Expands to $120&amp;nbsp;Billion | newspaper = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | date = 19 September 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Дмитрий | last = Бутрин | url= http://www.gazeta.ru/column/butrin/2844738.shtml | script-title=ru:Плесень конспирологии | newspaper = [[Gazeta.ru]] | date = 29 September 2008 | language = ru}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 July 2008, [[Mechel]]'s stock plunged by almost 38 percent after Russia's Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] criticized its CEO [[Igor Zyuzin]], and accused the company of selling resources to Russia at higher prices than those charged to foreign countries. The comments, which raised fears of another attack similar to that made on [[Yukos]] in 2004, contrasted sharply with previous efforts by President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] to improve Russia's reputation as an investor-friendly country.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news

===Money markets===

The crisis in [[money market]]s was imminent since spring, when [[Central Bank of Russia]] warned the public of a gradual contraction in bank lending due to unfolding world liquidity crisis. However, the regulator preferred to combat inflation, raising the [[refinancing rate]] and [[Bank reserves|bank reserve contributions]]. 1 September hike in reserve rate alone withdrew nearly 100&amp;nbsp;billion roubles from the money market.&lt;ref name=RUB&gt;{{cite news | title=Russia's Banking Crisis | url=http://eng.expert.ru/printissues/expert/2008/38/vtoroe_dno_besplatno/ | author=Maxim Rubchenko | publisher=Expert Online |date=29 September 2008 |accessdate=17 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081201073046/http://eng.expert.ru/printissues/expert/2008/38/vtoroe_dno_besplatno/| archivedate= 1 December 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The raise coincided with a seasonal peak in tax payments and left the banking system in a worse state of liquidity than that of August 1998.&lt;ref name=RUB/&gt; A subsequent drop in rouble-to-dollar exchange rate and dollar-denominated prices of Russian corporate securities forced investors to [[Crowding out (economics)|crowd out]], worsening the [[positive feedback]] loop. The interbank [[money market]] that traditionally relied on Russian corporate stock as a [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] for the [[repurchase agreement]]s, immediately imploded in what was called "a crisis of trust" or even "elimination of trust":&lt;ref name=ASP&gt;{{ cite news | title=Russia's Top Economist Needs to Face Reality | url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=27448 | publisher=Saint Peterburg Times|date=24 October 2008 | author=[[Anders Åslund]] |accessdate=17 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081025234421/http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=27448| archivedate= 25 October 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the borrowers defaulted on loans, leaving lenders with impaired collateral, other banks stopped lending as a precaution.&lt;ref name=RUB/&gt;

Money market crunch passed its first lowest mark 15–17 September. 17 September the government lent the country's three biggest banks, [[Sberbank]], [[VTB Bank]] and [[Gazprombank]], 1.13&amp;nbsp;trillion [[Russian ruble|rubles]] (US$44&amp;nbsp;billion) for at least three months to boost [[Market liquidity|liquidity]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=a1sZsKZ32kvU&amp;refer=europe Russian Exchanges Halt Trading for Second Day; VTB Declines], Bloomberg, 17 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the Central Bank lowered the [[reserve requirement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbr.ru/pw.aspx?file=/press/if/080917_1833473.htm Press Release of the Central Bank] (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed 24 September by Central Bank loans to keep the current accounts afloat and prevent a [[bank run]].

On 18 September, [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] ordered ministers to inject 500&amp;nbsp;billion [[Russian rouble|roubles]] of funds from the [[Federal budget of Russia|state budget]] into the markets and pledged that the financial system would receive "all necessary support".&lt;ref name="timesonline1"/&gt; On 7 October, Medvedev announced an additional $36&amp;nbsp;billion for banks on top of the $150&amp;nbsp;billion approved in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a16BnNfBwIkw&amp;refer=home|title=Russia Providing $200&amp;nbsp;Billion for Banks, Builders|publisher=[[Bloomberg LP]]|last=Mauldin|first=William|date=7 October 2008|accessdate=12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 September, [[Vladimir Putin]] announced a government policy aimed at refinancing Russian corporations that previously relied on foreign loans. Government authorized [[Vnesheconombank]] as its principal agent in distributing state loans to these corporations, amounting initially up to 50&amp;nbsp;billion US dollars, or 8% of Russia's foreign currency assets. At the same time Putin recommended the Central Bank to extend [[unsecured loan|unsecured]] stabilization loans to Russian banks,&lt;ref name=K30&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.kommersant.com/p1033709/VEB_nonresident_debt_redemption/| title=VEB to Guarantee Redemption of All Corporate Debt by Year-End | publisher=[[Kommersant]] |date=30 September 2008 | accessdate=17 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081010115919/http://www.kommersant.com/p1033709/VEB_nonresident_debt_redemption/| archivedate= 10 October 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was duly implemented.&lt;ref name=K1811/&gt; The policy was immediately dubbed "soft re-[[nationalisation]]" and criticized for selective picking of "eligible" borrowers.&lt;ref name=ASP/&gt; The 50&amp;nbsp;billion installment covers only the current portion of 477&amp;nbsp;billion US dollars owed by Russian corporations to foreign lenders; total assets of the government and the Central Bank combined are estimated at 550&amp;nbsp;billion US dollars.&lt;ref name=K30/&gt;

On 23 October, [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] changed the long-term outlook on the sovereign credit ratings of Russia from stable to negative, warning of the costs of bailing out troubled banks and a rising risk of a budget deficit in 2009. It also lowered Russia's Transfer and Convertibility (T&amp;C) assessment to [[Bond credit rating|BBB+]] from [[Bond credit rating|A-]]. At the same time, the 'BBB+' long-term foreign currency, the 'A-' long-term local currency ratings and the short-term ratings of [[Bond credit rating|A-2]] were affirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lse.co.uk/MacroEconomicNews.asp?ArticleCode=49l823n6gf5uvqg |title=TEXT-S&amp;P release on Russian Federation |agency=Reuters |work=Macroeconomic News |publisher=London South East |date=23 October 2008 |accessdate=4 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 December 2008, [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] additionally lowered Russia's foreign currency credit ratings to [[Bond credit rating|BBB]] (long term) and [[Bond credit rating|A-3]]. It also lowered Russia's Transfer and Convertibility (T&amp;C) assessment to [[Bond credit rating|BBB]] and the long-term local currency assessment to [[Bond credit rating|BBB+]]. On the other hand, the short-term credit rating in local currency was left intact as A-2.

===Tax and state budget policy===
{{see also|Federal budget of Russia}}
20 November [[Vladimir Putin]] announced government package of tax reforms. Corporate profit tax rate (24% in 2008) is to be reduced to 20%.&lt;ref name=R20&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Russia/idUSTRE4AJ57P20081120|title=Crisis will not sink Russian economy: Putin|agency=Reuters   |date=20 November 2008 |accessdate=20 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Profit tax base will decrease for companies investing in capital assets as the immediately recoverable depreciation allowance is raised from 10% to 30% of the asset cost. There will be no change in [[value added tax]] rates (maximum 18%) in 2009, but the government considered changing VAT accrual rules in favor of the taxpayers. Minister of finance [[Alexey Kudrin]], who resisted tax breaks until September,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Russia/idUSLH37815520080918|title=Russia boosts markets support, shares up in London|accessdate=20 November 2008 |agency=Reuters   |date=18 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081219120216/https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Russia/idUSLH37815520080918| archivedate= 19 December 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; concurred with Putin's proposal, estimating that they will save the businesses around 500&amp;nbsp;billion roubles annually.&lt;ref name=GA20&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/financial/2008/11/20/2889490.shtml|title=Dobro ot krizisa (Добро от кризиса)|publisher=gazeta.ru |date=20 November 2008|language=Russian|accessdate=20 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in November, Kudrin announced that the state has accepted the fact of a long-term drop in oil prices and that the existing [[Federal budget of Russia|state budget plans]] will hold unchanged if the oil prices stabilize on 50 dollars per barrel mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia's Finance Minister Declared Oil Price|url=http://www.kommersant.com/p1056193/r_500/Oil_budget_Kudrin/|publisher=Kommersant|date=13 November 2008|accessdate=15 November 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606105313/http://www.kommersant.com/p1056193/r_500/Oil_budget_Kudrin/|archive-date=6 June 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with tax breaks effective, Kudrin estimated that the 2009 state budget will break even or, in worst case, bear no more than 1% deficit.&lt;ref name=R20/&gt;&lt;ref name=GA20/&gt; The deficit will be covered by Stabilisation Fund, without resorting to borrowing.&lt;ref name=R20/&gt;

In December the government lifted import tariffs on industrial equipment imported by metallurgy, construction, forestry and textile industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gov't Lifts Industrial Equipment Duties |url=http://www.kommersant.com/p1089030/customs_and_duties/ |publisher=Kommersant, 5 December 2008 |accessdate=12 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309080445/http://www.kommersant.com/p1089030/customs_and_duties/ |archive-date=9 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time enforcing increased tariffs on imported cars.

On 15 April 2009, Finance Minister [[Alexei Kudrin]] said the federal budget will show a deficit of 7.4% of GDP in 2009. In comparison, the US expects a budget deficit of 13.5% of GDP, Britain 9.3%, and France 6.6%. According to Kudrin forecast for the 2010 deficit is 5%. Kudrin warned, that Russia must cut down its budget deficit before 2011. "Our vulnerability to the crisis is higher than that of the countries with more diversified economies. This is why 2009 should be a unique year. We must not have a comparable budget deficit in subsequent years. We must work to reduce it to 3% in 2011," he said.&lt;ref name="budget_deficit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20090415/121134126.html |title=Russia reviews forecast for its budget deficit |date=15 April 2009 |publisher=[[RIA Novosti]] |accessdate=25 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hFCtOV0u?url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20090415/121134126.html |archivedate=3 June 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian economic crisis==
At the end of November 2008, The Russian economy as a whole was not in a state of recession. The government forecast for 2009 stood at a 6.7% annual growth rate while a November 2008 [[World Bank]] report projected 3% growth for 2009,&lt;ref name=R21&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/reutersEdge/idUSTRE4AK4L620081121 | title=Russia acknowledges financial crisis has hit hard |agency=Reuters   |date=21 November 2008 | accessdate=22 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a revised projection issued 30 March 2009 by the World Bank projects a 4.5% decrease for 2009 with unemployment projected to rise to 12% by the end of 2009. The World Bank report expressed concern about the condition of the poor and recommended increases in social support payments such as unemployment payments and child support payments.

In the middle of December 2008 Russian officials confirmed that possibility of a recession was inevitable. "Russia is headed for a recession", the country's deputy economy minister, [[Andrei Klepach]], has said. Asked whether Russia would have a recession, he said: "It's started already.

===Steel industry===

Russian steel industry is dependent on foreign markets and domestic construction and automobile industries. Crisis in the industry was first publicly reported in the end of September – early October.

Some of Evraz facilities were converted to a four-day working week; the company reduced output to an estimated 50–60% of its capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sekonomit na zarplate (Сэкономить на зарплате) |url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml?2008/11/14/168972 |publisher=[[Vedomosti]] |date=14 November 2008 |language=Russian |accessdate=15 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226064233/http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml?2008%2F11%2F14%2F168972 |archivedate=26 December 2008 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 November [[Goskomstat]] insider reported an unprecedented drop in industrial prices – minus 6.6% monthly, following a 0.8% drop in September (the agency itself delayed its regular monthly report).

===Agriculture, food industry and retail===

Russia had a high grain harvest in 2008, but so it was elsewhere in the world, bringing the prices down. To support the trade, [[Dmitry Medvedev]] authorized a state export subsidy of 40 US dollars per [[metric ton]]. This, according to the minister of agriculture, is sufficient to maintain exports at 20–25&amp;nbsp;million metric tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Harvester Operators to Be Fed from Budget | url=http://www.kommersant.com/p1056449/Subvention_agriculture/ | publisher=Kommersant | date=12 November 2008 | accessdate=16 November 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606110417/http://www.kommersant.com/p1056449/Subvention_agriculture/ | archive-date=6 June 2011 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The food industry is, however, locked between high costs of farm produce and tight price and credit terms dictated by retail chains. Food industry executives anticipate that the chains will eventually lose part of their clients to street markets, as the suppliers are forced to develop this independent sales channel.&lt;ref name=POMI&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.expert.ru/articles/2008/11/14/pomidor/ | title= Iz setey na rynok (Из сетей на рынок) | publisher=Expert Online |date=14 November 2008 | language=Russian | accessdate=16 November 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081206022955/http://expert.ru/articles/2008/11/14/pomidor/| archivedate= 6 December 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic retail chains, [[Leverage (finance)|heavily leveraged]],&lt;ref name=RVR/&gt; were experiencing [[liquidity crisis]] at least since April 2008.&lt;ref name=KAPR&gt;{{cite news | title=Chains Drown in Debts | url=http://www.kommersant.com/p879075/top_50_Russian_retailers_rating/ | publisher=Kommersant, 14 April 2008 | accessdate=16 November 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227084550/http://www.kommersant.com/p879075/top_50_Russian_retailers_rating | archive-date=27 February 2009 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first chain to go bankrupt in May 2008, [[Grossmart]] (190 stores in Moscow region), had a particularly high debt-to-[[EBITDA]] ratio of 6 to 1.&lt;ref name=KAPR/&gt;&lt;ref name=E9&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.expert.ru/articles/2008/09/01/document430708/ | title=Vremya defoltov (Время дефолтов) | language=Russian | publisher=Expert Online |date=1 September 2008 | accessdate=16 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arbat Prestige]], subject to government attacks since 2007, defaulted on its bonds in June.&lt;ref name=E9/&gt; In November 2008 nine leading food retail chains (out of nearly 300) received access to government-backed financing.&lt;ref name=POMI/&gt; Nevertheless, retailers are pressing food suppliers for longer credit terms or bigger [[cash discount]]s, demanding up to 50% price cut for cash payment. Suppliers, in a mirror move, raised "regular" credit prices by 20–60%. Rather than submit to the chains' demands, they simply refuse to sell; visible depletion of stocks has affected only a few affected chains.&lt;ref name=RVR/&gt;

==Social impact==

===Unemployment===

A proprietary [[Ernst &amp; Young]] survey of 113 clients that leaked into Russian press in November summarized their losses at 8% of managerial and 6% of low-level jobs by end of October. All companies in the survey practiced some sort of reducing labor costs. One company in four practiced unpaid "vacations"; 8% of clients settled for reduced working hours.&lt;ref name=V2411&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml?2008/11/24/170362 |title=Glavnye uvolnenia vperedi (Главные увольнения впереди) |publisher=[[Vedomosti]] |date=24 November 2008 |accessdate=7 December 2008 |language=Russian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226064243/http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml?2008%2F11%2F24%2F170362 |archivedate=26 December 2008 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Federal Migratory Service]] announced in November that 1123 Russian companies reported upcoming layoffs of 45 thousand.&lt;ref name=FMSN/&gt;

By late November, Kremlin First Deputy Chief of Staff, [[Vladislav Surkov]], was warning that the middle classes should be defended from poverty during the crisis. He called for swift measures to protect the middle class from layoffs and to support consumption.&lt;ref name=R2811&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/afxnewslimited/feeds/afx/2008/11/28/afx5755046.html | title=Kremlin says to defend Russian middle class in crisis | author=Guy Faulconbridge |agency=Reuters   |date=28 November 2008 | accessdate=7 December 2008 | work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "If the 1980s were the times of the intellectuals and the 1990s were the times of the oligarchs then the 00s can be seen as the epoch of the middle classes,' Surkov said in a speech published on the Web site of the ruling United Russia party ... The main task of the state during the slump must become the preservation of the middle class, the defence of the middle class from the waves of poverty and confusion that are coming from the West," he said.&lt;ref name=R2811/&gt;

According to official statements released 9 December, rate of unemployment growth peaked in the middle of November and slowed down in subsequent weeks. In the week ending 3 December overall unemployment grew by 1.6% to 1.315&amp;nbsp;million people, following a 2.3% increase in the preceding week. The state also reported an increase in unpaid vacations and reduced working week employees to 149.3 thousands. The number increased by 84% in a single week ending 3 December. The trade unions anticipate that official unemployment will peak at around 2 million people in 2009, when hidden forms of unemployment become visible to statisticians.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=1091372&amp;ThemesID=437 | title=Monitoring Minzdrava (Мониторинг Минздрава) | language=Russian | publisher=[[Kommersant]], 9 December 2008 | accessdate=9 December 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081215132313/http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=1091372&amp;ThemesID=437| archivedate= 15 December 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet on 12 December Putin announced completely different unemployment numbers – 4.6&amp;nbsp;million in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://rg.ru/2008/12/15/putin.html | title=Banki v prioritete (Банки в приоритете) | publisher=Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 15 December 2008 | accessdate=15 December 2008 | language=Russian | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081215075857/http://www.rg.ru/2008/12/15/putin.html| archivedate= 15 December 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009 the unemployment rate peaked at a seven-year high of 9.4%, then began to steadily decline, falling to 7.7% as of October.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=RUREFEG:IND Russian unemployment rates] [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] Retrieved on 16 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumer price inflation===
Official consumer price inflation in January–August 2008 reached 14.8%.&lt;ref name=RVR&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc-rss.aspx?DocsID=1050454 | title=Raznitsa v roznitse (Разница в рознице) | publisher=Sekret firmy |date=3 November 2008 | language=Russian | accessdate=17 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of November, food price inflation for an 11-month period reached 15.3%. Overall price inflation, taking into account consumer and industrial prices, reached 12.5% compared to 10.6% for the same period of 2007.
