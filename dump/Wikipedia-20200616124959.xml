      <text bytes="12031" xml:space="preserve">'''Constrained writing''' is a [[literary technique]] in which the writer is bound by some condition that forbids certain things or imposes a pattern.&lt;ref name="SS1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Andrews|first=Dale| title=Constrained Writing | url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2013/02/constrained-writing.html | publisher=SleuthSayers| location=Washington| date=2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constraints are very common in [[poetry]], which often requires the writer to use a particular verse form.

==Description==

Constraints on writing are common and can serve a variety of purposes. For example, a text may place restrictions on its [[vocabulary]], e.g. [[Basic English]], [[E-Prime|copula-free text]], [[defining vocabulary]] for dictionaries, and other limited vocabularies for teaching [[English as an additional language|English as a second language]] or to children.

In poetry, formal constraints abound in both mainstream and experimental work. Familiar elements of poetry like [[rhyme]] and [[Meter (poetry)|meter]] are often applied as constraints. Well-established verse forms like the [[sonnet]], [[sestina]], [[villanelle]], [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]], and [[haiku]] are variously constrained by meter, rhyme, repetition, length, and other characteristics.

Outside of established traditions, particularly in the [[avant-garde]], writers have produced a variety of work under more severe constraints; this is often what the term "constrained writing" is specifically applied to. For example: 

* [[Reverse-lipogram]]s: each word must contain a particular letter.
* [[Univocalic|Univocalic poetry]], using only one vowel.
* Mandated vocabulary, where the writer must include specific words (for example, Quadrivial Quandary&lt;REF&gt;[http://www.quadrivialquandary.com QuadrivialQUandary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; solicits individual sentences containing all four words in a daily selection).
* Bilingual homophonous poetry, where the poem makes sense in two different languages at the same time, constituting two simultaneous homophonous poems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zuckermann.org/poetry.html Bilingual Homophonous Poetry] – Italo-Hebraic Bilingual Homophonous Poem by linguist [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], in which the Hebrew poem sounds identical to the Italian one, both making full sense – see Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2006), "Shir Du-Leshoni" (Bilingual Poem), ''Ho!, Literary Magazine'' 3, pp. 256–257.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[alliteration|Alliterative]]s or [[tautogram]]s, in which every word must start with the same letter (or subset of letters; see ''[[Alphabetical Africa]]'').
* [[Lipogram]]: a letter (commonly e or o) is outlawed.
* [[Acrostic]]s: first letter of each word/sentence/paragraph forms a word or sentence.
* [[Abecedarius]]: first letter of each word/verse/section goes through the alphabet.
* [[Palindrome]]s, such as the word "[[radar]]", read the same forwards and backwards.
* [[Anglish]], favouring Anglo-Saxon words over Greek and Roman/Latin words.
* [[Pilish]], where the lengths of consecutive words match the digits of the [[pi|number π]].
* [[Anagram]]s, words or sentences formed by rearranging the letters of another.
* Limitations in punctuation, such as [[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]]'s book ''[[True History of the Kelly Gang]]'', which features no [[comma]]s.
* [[One syllable article]], a form unique to [[Chinese literature]], using many characters all of which are [[homophone]]s; the result looks sensible as writing but is very confusing when read aloud.
* Chaterism, where the length of words in a phrase or sentence increases or decreases in a uniform, mathematical way.
* [[Aleatory]], where the reader supplies a random input.
* [[Erasure (artform)|Erasure]], which involves erasing words from an existing text and framing the result on the page as a poem. 

The [[Oulipo]] group is a gathering of writers who use such techniques. The [[Outrapo]] group uses [[theatrical constraints]].&lt;ref name=CB2&gt;{{cite web| last=Lundin|first=Leigh| title=L'Oulipo| url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=7124 |work=Constrained Writing| publisher=Criminal Brief |accessdate=28 February 2013| location=Orlando| date=2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of constrained writing forms that are restricted by length, including:
* [[Six-Word Memoirs]]: 6 words
* [[Haiku]]: ~ 3 lines (5–7–5 syllables or 2–3–2 beats recommended.)
* [[Minisaga]]: 50 words, +15 for title
* [[Drabble]]: 100 words
* [[Twiction]]: espoused as a specifically constrained form of [[microfiction]] where a story or poem is exactly 140 characters long.
* [[Sijo]]: three lines average 14–16 syllables, for a total of 44–46: theme (3, 4,4,4); elaboration (3,4,4,4); counter-theme (3,5) and completion (4,3).

== Examples ==

* [[Ernest Vincent Wright]]'s ''[[Gadsby (novel)|Gadsby]]'' (1939) is an English-language novel consisting of 50,000 words, none of which contain the letter "e".
* In 1969, French writer [[Georges Perec]] published ''[[La Disparition]]'', a novel that did not include the letter "e". It was translated into English in 1995 by [[Gilbert Adair]]. Perec subsequently joked that he incorporated the "e"s not used into ''La Disparition'' in the novella ''{{ill|Les Revenentes|fr}}'' (1972), which uses no vowels other than "e". ''Les Revenentes'' was translated into English by [[Ian Monk]] as ''The Exeter Text: Jewels, Secrets, Sex''.
*  [[Georges Perec|Perec]] also wrote ''[[Life A User's Manual]]'' using the [[Knight's Tour]] method of construction. The book is set in a fictional Parisian block of flats, where  Perec devises the elevation of the building as a 10&amp;times;10 grid: 10 storeys, including basements and attics and 10 rooms across, including 2 for the stairwell. Each room is assigned to a chapter, and the order of the chapters is given by the knight's moves on the grid. 
* Several of the [[Psalms]] are [[Abecedarius|abecedarian]] in the Hebrew alphabet
* The 2004 French novel ''[[Le Train de Nulle Part]]'' (''The Train from Nowhere'') by [[Michel Thaler]] was written entirely without [[verb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://chronicle.com/article/A-New-Novel-No-Verbs-in/102731/ A New Novel, No Verbs, in France, No Less]'' by Scott McLemee, The Chronicle of Higher Education, June 2, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''let me tell you'' (2008), a novel by the Welsh writer [[Paul Griffiths (writer)|Paul Griffiths]], uses only the words allotted to Ophelia in ''[[Hamlet]]''.
* Experimental Canadian poet [[Christian Bök]]’s ''[[Eunoia (book)|Eunoia]]'' is a [[univocalic]] that uses only one vowel in each of its five chapters.
* One famous piece of constrained writing in the [[Chinese language]] is ''The [[Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den]]'' which consists of 92 characters, all with the sound ''shi''. Another is the ''[[Thousand Character Classic]]'' in which all 1000 characters are unique without any repetition.
* "[[Cadaeic Cadenza]]" is a short story by [[Mike Keith (mathematician)|Mike Keith]] using the first 3835 digits of [[pi]] to determine the length of words.  ''Not A Wake'' is a book using the same constraint based on the first 10,000 digits.
* ''[[Never Again (novel)|Never Again]]'' is a novel by [[Doug Nufer]] in which no word is used more than once.
* ''[[Ella Minnow Pea]]'' is a book by [[Mark Dunn]] where certain letters become unusable throughout the novel.
* ''[[Alphabetical Africa]]'' is a book by [[Walter Abish]] in which the first chapter only uses words that begin with the letter "a", while the second chapter incorporates the letter "b", and then "c", etc. Once the alphabet is finished, Abish takes letters away, one at a time, until the last chapter, leaving only words that begin with the letter "a".
* [[Lucy Aikin|Mary Godolphin]] wrote versions of ''Robinson Crusoe'', ''Aesop's Fables'', ''The Swiss Family Robinson'', and other books using only monosyllabic words.
* [[Dr. Seuss|Theodor Geisel]], also known as Dr. Seuss, wrote the well-known children's book ''[[Green Eggs and Ham]]'' using only 50 different words on a 50 dollar bet with [[Bennett Cerf]].&lt;ref name="Snopes"&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/language/literary/greenegg.htm Urban Legends Reference Pages: Language (Green Eggs and Ham)], ''[[Snopes]],'' Accessed on 26 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Gates of Paradise]]'' is a book by [[Jerzy Andrzejewski]] where the whole text is just two sentences, one of which is very long.
* ''[[Zero degree|Zero Degree]]'' is a postmodern lipogrammatic novel written in 1998 by [[Tamil language |Tamil]] author [[Charu Nivedita]], later translated into Malayalam and English. The Tamil words 'oru' and 'ondru' (the English equivalents are 'a', 'an' and 'one') have not been mentioned anywhere in the novel, except one chapter. Keeping with the numerological theme of Zero Degree, the only numbers expressed in either words or symbols are numerologically equivalent to nine (with the exception of two chapters). This Oulipian ban includes the very common word one. Many sections of the book are written entirely without punctuation, or using only periods. 
* In the book [[A Gun Is Not Polite]], author Jonathan Ruffian rearranges given sentences containing the word "gun" as found on the internet into micro fiction.
* Uruguayan musician, comedian and writer [[Leo Maslíah]]'s 1999 novel ''Líneas'' (''Lines'') is written entirely with paragraphs comprising a single sentence.
* A novel ''Gorm, Son of Hardecnut'' (''Горм, сын Хёрдакнута'')&lt;ref name="Горм, сын Хёрдакнута"&gt;[http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/gorm-son-of-hardecnut-peter-vorobieff/1101716540 Gorm, son of Hardecnut by Peter Vorobieff], Accessed on 16 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Gorm the Old]]) by Peter Vorobieff is written in Russian without any words borrowed from English, French, Latin, or modern German since the 17th century. (Cf. [[Anglish]].) The book also never uses many common words, including "human", "please", and "thank you".
* Examples of [[Erasure (artform)|erasure]] include [[Tom Phillips (artist)|Tom Phillips]]'s ''[[A Humument]]'' (1970); [[Mary Ruefle]]'s ''A Little White Shadow'' (2006), an erasure of the Victorian novel of the same name by [[Emily Malbone Morgan]]; [[Janet Holmes]]'s ''The ms of my kin'' (2009), an erasure of poetry by [[Emily Dickinson]]; [[Matthea Harvey]]'s ''Of Lamb'' (2011), an erasure of a biography of [[Charles Lamb]]; [http://www.deerbrookeditions.com/kin-s-fur ''ALL '''KIN'''D'''S''' OF '''FUR'''''], [https://margaretyocom.com/ Margaret Yocom's] erasure of a controversial tale from the Brothers Grimm (2018); and many more.
* [[Anna Rabinowitz]]'s ''Darkling'' (2001) is a book-length acrostic about the [[Holocaust]].
* The 17th-century [[Odia language|Odia]] poet [[Upendra Bhanja]] wrote multiple epics (Satisha Bilasa, Kala Kautuka, Baidehisha Bilasha, etc.) with the same syllable at the beginning of each sentence.{{clarify|date=April 2020}}
