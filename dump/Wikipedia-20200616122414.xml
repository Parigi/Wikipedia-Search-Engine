'''Solar power in California''' includes utility-scale [[solar power plant]]s as well as local [[distributed generation]], mostly from rooftop [[photovoltaics]]. It has been growing rapidly because of high [[insolation]], community support, declining solar costs, and a [[Renewable Portfolio Standard]] which requires that 33% of [[California]]'s electricity come from [[renewable resource]]s by 2020, and 60% by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/840|title=California: Renewables Portfolio Standard|author=|publisher=Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency|date=2015-10-07|accessdate=2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Much of this is expected to come from solar power via [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] facilities or [[concentrated solar power]] facilities.

In 2019, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reported a total of 27,400 MW of solar capacity installed (3,125 MW in 2019 alone), making up 20% of all electricity produced in the state. California currently ranks as the highest solar power generating state in the nation, producing enough solar capacity to power 7.7 million homes in the state. In 2019, SEIA estimated that California will increase its solar capacity by 16,000 MW over the next 5 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Over the last 20 years, California has been home to a number of world's largest solar facilities, many of which are located in the [[Mojave Desert]]. In 1991, the 354 MW [[Solar Energy Generating Systems]] plant (located in [[San Bernardino County, California]]) held the title until being bested by the 392 MW [[Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System]], a solar thermal plant located in San Bernardino County near the [[Nevada]] border. 

The early to mid 2010s saw the sharpest increase in solar development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/renewables/tracking_progress/documents/renewable.pdf|title=California Energy Commission â€“ Tracking Progress|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2013, California had 490 MW of [[concentrated solar power]] and 5,183 MW of photovoltaics capacity in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irecusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Final-Solar-Report-7-3-14-W-2.pdf|title=U.S. Solar Market Trends 2013|author=Sherwood, Larry|publisher=Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC)|date=July 2014|accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the 550 MW [[Topaz Solar Farm]] became the new "world's largest operational" solar facility and went online in [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]], California.  A second 550 MW facility, [[Desert Sunlight Solar Farm]], also went online in [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]] in 2014 and was constructed by [[First Solar]].  Both these were superseded, however, by the [[Solar Star]] photovoltaic project that went online with 579 MW in June 2015 in Antelope Valley, California, which is located in southern [[Kern County, California|Kern County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Solar-Star-Largest-PV-Power-Plant-in-the-World-Now-Operational|title = Solar Star, Largest PV Power Plant in the World, Now Operational|last = Wesoff|first = Eric|date = 26 June 2015|work = Greentech Media|access-date = 28 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While California hosted the three largest photovoltaic facilities in the world (as of July 2015), there are yet several proposals for even larger facilities seeking regulatory approval in California, such as the 2.7 GW [[Westlands Solar Park]].

In December 2017, the Solar on Multifamily Affordable Housing (SOMAH) program was approved by the [[California Public Utilities Commission]]. The program will allocate one billion dollars from the state's greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program over the following decade to incentivize owners of affordable, multi-family buildings to install solar, with a goal of adding 300MW of capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/california-will-spend-1-billion-on-low-income-multifamily-solar|title=California Will Spend $1 Billion on Low-income, Multifamily Solar|last1=Cohen|first1=Josh|date=8 January 2018|website=Next City|accessdate=2019-09-15 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313092621/https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/california-will-spend-1-billion-on-low-income-multifamily-solar | archive-date=2018-03-13 | url-status=live | quote=California is ready to spend $1 billion over the next decade on rooftop solar installation for low-income residents. In December, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved the creation of the Solar on Multifamily Affordable Housing (SOMAH) program. Funded by the statewide greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program, it will provide $100 million in annual solar installation incentives for the owners of affordable multifamily buildings. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

California also leads the nation in the number of homes which have solar panels installed, totaling over 230,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-no-solar-20140810-story.html|title=Rules prevent solar panels in many states with abundant sunlight|author=Evan Halper|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2014-08-09|accessdate=2014-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many were installed because of the [[California Solar Initiative|Million Solar Roof 
Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsc.ncsu.edu/programs/million_solar_roofs_initiative.cfm Million Solar Roofs Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, the 5 commissioners of the [[California Energy Commission]] (CEC) voted unanimously to require that nearly all new homes (both single-family and multi-family) under four stories in the state be built with photovoltaic solar panes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=California Energy Commission|date=December 2018|title=2019 Building Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential Buildings|url=https://ww2.energy.ca.gov/2018publications/CEC-400-2018-020/CEC-400-2018-020-CMF.pdf|journal=2019 Building Energy Efficiency Standards|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developers can pursue community solar projects instead of rooftop panel systems for individual properties if they receive approval from the CEC and local utility company.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|title=An overview of the California solar mandate|url=https://news.energysage.com/an-overview-of-the-california-solar-mandate/|last=Thoubboron|first=Kerry|date=November 7, 2019|website=Energy Sage|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2020, the CEC decided to give developers the option to build new homes that retrieve solar power from rooftop solar panels or from the Sacramento Municipality Utility District (SMUD)'s offsite solar installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title=California Energy Commission approves first community solar proposal under 2019 Energy Code|url=https://www.energy.ca.gov/news/2020-02/california-energy-commission-approves-first-community-solar-proposal-under-2019|date=February 20, 2020|publisher=California Energy Commission|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Regulators loosen California's groundbreaking rule to require residential rooftop solar|url=https://calmatters.org/environment/2020/02/california-rooftop-solar-mandate-smud-community-neighborhood-solar-shares/|last=Kranking|first=Carlyn|date=February 20, 2020|website=Cal Matters|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2019-11-13/california-will-still-require-rooftop-solar-panels-on-new-homes-at-least-for-now|title=California will still require rooftop solar panels on new homes â€” at least for now|last=Roth|first=Sammy|date=2019-11-14|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The size of the systems to be installed is to be somewhat limited and is intended to perform a supplementary role. Builders will be able to decrease the size of the system further if they incorporate power storage into the home. The justification for the smaller size of the systems is due to the high amount of solar power produced by the grid during the daytime, much of which is attributable to California's extensive use of utility grade solar systems. This overlap would devalue a more powerful home solar system, as the energy it would displace from the grid would be largely solar generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2018/05/04/california-to-become-first-u-s-state-mandating-solar-on-new-homes/|title=California to become first U.S. state mandating solar on new homes|last=Collins|first=Jeff|date=4 May 2018|website=The Orange County Registrar|access-date=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Affordable housing|Housing affordability]] is also a concern with this measure, an area where California already struggles greatly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/opportunity/affordability|title=Best States 2018: How They Were Ranked|last=US News Staff|date=27 February 2018|website=US News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302101321/https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/opportunity/affordability|archive-date=2017-03-02|url-status=dead|access-date=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2017 survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, 37.8% of California homeowners with mortgages are "cost-burdened," with housing costs exceeding 30% of the household income, and 16.3% face housing costs exceeding 50% of the household income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=California's Housing Affordability Crisis Hits Renters and Households With the Lowest Incomes the Hardest|url=https://calbudgetcenter.org/resources/californias-housing-affordability-crisis-hits-renters-and-households-with-the-lowest-incomes-the-hardest/|last=Kimberlin|first=Sara|date=April 2019|website=California Budget and Policy Center|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CEC predicts that the requirement of photovoltaic panels will increase the cost of a newly-built single-family home by about $40 per month in extra mortgage payments, but eventually save about $80 on electricity costs.''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=An overview of the California solar mandate|url=https://news.energysage.com/an-overview-of-the-california-solar-mandate/|last=Thoubboron|first=Kerry|date=November 7, 2019|website=Energy Sage|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' The CEC released data showing that the system would more than pay for itself, however charitable organizations such as [[Habitat for Humanity]] have expressed their concerns as this will require the organization to receive additional donations in order to pay for the photovoltaic panels that the group would be required to install on every house it builds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/9/17335832/california-solar-panel-housing-politics-renewable-energy|title=California is requiring solar panels on all new houses: here's what that means|last=Chen|first=Angela|date=9 May 2018|website=The Verge|access-date=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photovoltaics==
In 2011, California's goal to install 3,000 MW of distributed generation by 2016 was expanded to 12,000 MW by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irecusa.org/2012/07/irec-releases-new-report-12000-mw-of-distributed-generation-by-2020-in-ca/ 12,000 MW of Renewable Distributed Generation by 2020]&lt;/ref&gt; 
California has more photovoltaics installed than any other federal state, and 48% of the U.S. total in 2010. For the first time in 2008 the installed photovoltaics exceeded the state's 354&amp;nbsp;MW of solar thermal (CSP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energyalmanac.ca.gov/renewables/solar/pv.html California Solar Photovoltaic Statistics &amp; Data] retrieved 01 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://irecusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IREC-Solar-Market-Trends-Report-June-2011-web.pdf Solar Market Trends]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://openpv.nrel.gov/search?&amp;state=CA&amp;maxdate=1325289600&amp;pagenum=1&amp;nppage=25|title=The Open PV Project - Search|last=(DAV-SEAC)|first=NREL Data Analysis and Visualization Group|website=openpv.nrel.gov|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are plans to build over 15,000 MW of utility scale photovoltaic plants in California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seia.org/research-resources/major-solar-projects-list Major Projects List]&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2012, small systems of less than 10 kWp were averaging $5.39/W, and large systems of over 500 kWp were averaging $2.77/W.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.californiasolarstatistics.ca.gov/reports/quarterly_cost_per_watt/|title=California Solar Statistics|website=www.californiasolarstatistics.ca.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

California has the technical potential to install 128.9 GW of rooftop solar panels, which would generate 194,000 GWh/year, about 74% of the total electricity used in California in 2013. This is environmentally desirable because it would conserve large swaths of desert by placing panels atop preexisting structures instead. 128 GW, though, is three to four times as much electricity as is used at once, which requires that most of the noon output will need to be [[Energy storage|stored]] or exported on a sunny day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy16osti/65298.pdf Rooftop Solar Photovoltaic Technical Potential in the United States: A Detailed Assessment]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Milestones ===
On May 13, 2017, the [[California Independent System Operator]] (CAISO) reported that the state had broken a new renewable energy record, with non-hydro renewables providing 67.2% of the total electricity on the ISO's grid, with another 13.5% being provided by hydro. The ISO reported that solar was providing approximately 17.2% of the total electricity.

On March 5, 2018, at around 1 PM, utility grade solar energy met 50% of California's total electrical power demand for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/california-sets-two-new-solar-records#gs.StZ8dRou|title=California Sets Two New Solar Records|last=Pyper|first=Julia|date=6 March 2018|website=Green Tech Media|access-date=7 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government support==

===Renewable Portfolio Standard===
Solar power in California has been growing rapidly. The most recent [[Renewables Portfolio Standard]] (RPS), SB 100 effective January 1, 2019, requires that 60% of California's electricity come from [[renewable resource]]s by 2030, and 100% by 2045.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/rps/&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this is expected to come from solar power.

According to a recent report by the California Public Utilities Commission, California failed to meet the 20% renewables by 2010 target. [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] and [[Southern California Edison]] were the closest to meeting the goal. PG&amp;E generated 17.7% of the electricity it sold in 2010 from renewable sources while SCE was the closest to hitting the RPS goal by producing 19.4% of its electricity from renewable sources in 2010. [[San Diego Gas &amp; Electric]], on the other hand, generated only 11.9% of its electricity from renewable sources in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solar-california.org/2011/03/california-utilities-do-not-meet-2010-renewable-energy-goal/ California Utilities Do Not Meet 2010 Renewable Energy Goal]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2014, California had 7,808 MW&lt;!--2900 MW rooftop PV, 4152 MW utility PV, 676 MW CSP--&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/california|title=California Solar|accessdate=2014-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; of solar and 5,830 MW&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.awea.org/Resources/state.aspx?ItemNumber=5232|title=U.S. Wind Industry Report|author=|publisher=[[American Wind Energy Association]]|date=2014|accessdate=2014-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; of wind farms. California adopted feed-in tariffs, a tool similar to what Europe has been using, to encourage the solar power industry. Proposals were raised aiming to create a small-scale solar market in California that brings the benefits of the German market, such as [[distributed generation]], which avoids the need for transmission because power is generated close to where it is used, and avoid the drawbacks such as excessively high payments that could become a burden on utility customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20091006-710542.html |title=California Eyes Euro-Style Market For Solar |publisher=Dow Jones Newswires |date=October 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010104535/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20091006-710542.html |archivedate=October 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===California Solar Initiative===
The California Solar Initiative is a 2006 initiative to install 3,000&amp;nbsp;MW of additional solar power by 2016. Included in it is the Million Solar Roof Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/puc/energy/solar/ The California Solar Initiative] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223101636/http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUC/energy/solar/ |date=2009-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, this goal was expanded to 12,000&amp;nbsp;MW by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyseba/2011/08/09/the-ebay-of-electricity/2/|title=The eBay of Electricity|last=Seba|first=Tony|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s Million Solar Roofs Program, California has set a goal to create 1,940 megawatts&lt;ref name="CAsolartargets"&gt;[http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/puc/energy/solar/aboutsolar.htm About the California Solar Initiative] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307050146/http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUC/energy/Solar/aboutsolar.htm |date=2013-03-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; of new, solar-produced electricity by 2016 â€” moving the state toward a cleaner energy future and helping lower the cost of solar systems for consumers. The California Solar Initiative has "a total budget of $2.167 billion between 2007 and 2016 and a goal to install approximately 1,940 MW of new solar generation capacity."

According to the CPUC, homeowners, businesses, and local governments installed 158&amp;nbsp;MW of solar photovoltaics (PV) in 2008, doubling the 78&amp;nbsp;MW installed in 2007, giving California a cumulative total of 441&amp;nbsp;MW of distributed solar PV systems, the highest in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PUBLISHED/NEWS_RELEASE/96627.htm CPUC Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2016, 4,216 MW have been installed in 537,647 projects.

The CSI initially offered cash incentives on solar PV systems of up to $2.50 per AC watt. These incentives, combined with federal tax incentives, could cover up to 50% of the total cost of a solar system.  The incentive program was designed so that the incentives would reduce in steps based on the amount of solar installed in each of 6 categories.  There are separate steps for residential and non-residential customers in the territories of each of the State's 3 investor-owned utilities.  As of July 2012, the rebates range from $0.20 to $0.35 per AC watt for residential and commercial systems and from $0.70 to $1.10 for systems for non-profits and government entities.&lt;ref name="CAsolar"/&gt;

There are many financial incentives to support the use of renewable energy in other US states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsireusa.org/library/includes/incentivenew.cfm?&amp;CurrentPageID=3&amp;EE=0&amp;RE=1 Financial Incentives in the USA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109180330/http://www.dsireusa.org/library/includes/incentivenew.cfm?&amp;CurrentPageID=3&amp;EE=0&amp;RE=1 |date=2008-01-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; CSI provides more than $2 billion worth of incentives to customers for installing photovoltaic,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gosolarcalifornia.ca.gov/documents/CSI_HANDBOOK.PDF CSI Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt; and electricity displacing solar thermal&lt;ref&gt;[[California Public Utilities Commission]] press release [http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PUBLISHED/NEWS_RELEASE/76877.htm "CPUC establishes California Solar Initiative requirements for solar thermal technologies"], December 20, 2007.  Accessed February 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; systems in the three California Investor-Owned Utilities service territories.

The program was authorized by the California Public Utilities Commission and by the [[Senate Bill]] 1 (SB 1):

* Decision (D.) 06-01-024, in collaboration with the California Energy Commission, with the goal of installing 3,000 [[Watt#Megawatt|MW]] of new solar facilities in California's homes and businesses by 2017.
* On August 21, 2006, the Governor signed SB1, which directs the CPUC and the CEC to implement the CSI program consistent with specific requirements and budget limits set forth in legislation.

Responsibility for administration of the CSI Program is shared by Investor-Owned Utilities:
* Pacific Gas and Electric Company â€“ PG&amp;E customers;
* Southern California Edison Company â€“ SCE customers;
* California Center for Sustainable Energy â€“ SDG&amp;E customers.

Residential installation starts in early 2007 fell off sharply in SCE territory because of the disincentives inherent in SB1, requiring time-of-use (TOU) tariffs, with the result that homeowners who install panels may find their electric bill increasing rather than decreasing. The governor and legislature moved quickly to pass AB1714 (June 2007) to delay the implementation of this rule until 2009.

California has a favorable net metering law, being one of five states to receive an A in 2007, while five states received an F, in an evaluation of the 38&amp;nbsp;states plus [[Washington D.C.]] with net metering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashrae.org/advocacy/page/1577 Report: States Falling Short on Interconnection and Net Metering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515193337/http://ashrae.org/advocacy/page/1577 |date=2008-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Interstate Renewable Energy Council|IREC]] best practices, based on experience, recommends no limits to net metering, individual or aggregate, and perpetual roll over of kWh credits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irecusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ASES-2009-Paper-0131-net-metering-and-IC-best-practices-1.pdf Net Metering and Interconnection Procedures Incorporating Best Practices]&lt;/ref&gt; As California was rapidly approaching the 5% aggregate limit, a May 24, 2012 ruling by the CPUC clarified the calculation of the limit, and requested a report on the cost of net metering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freeingthegrid.org/#dev/2012/05/24/cpuc-unanimously-approves-net-metering-expansion-in-california/|title=Freeing the Grid|website=freeingthegrid.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PUBLISHED/Graphics/167155.pdf Decision Regarding Calculation of the Net Energy Metering Cap]&lt;/ref&gt; California subsequently uncapped the net metering program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Solar-companies-and-customers-win-big-in-6790872.php|title=Solar homeowners win big in California ruling, for now|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically states have raised or eliminated their aggregate limits before they were reached.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irecusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IREC-Annual-Trends-Report-Final-10-11-11-web.pdf 2011 Updates and Trends]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, 16 states including California received an A for net metering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freeingthegrid.org/|title=Freeing the Grid|website=freeingthegrid.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The California solar deployment has increased its [[duck curve]] (power demand for traditional power plants) to the point where large power plants are turned down to minimum during the day, while requiring large and fast [[power ramp]]ing by [[Load following power plant|load following]] and [[Peaking power plant|peaker plants]] to supply [[peak demand]] in the evening when the sun has gone down. Several methods are being developed to cope with the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://insideenergy.org/2014/10/02/ie-questions-why-is-california-trying-to-behead-the-duck/ |title=IE Questions: Why Is California Trying To Behead The Duck? |first=Jordan |last=Wirfs-Brock |date= 2014-10-02|work=Inside Energy |accessdate= 2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dynamic pricing#Time-based utility pricing|Time-of-use pricing]] is being rolled out, and has been effective in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.utilitydive.com/news/the-duck-is-learning-to-fly-in-california-and-hawaii/424061/ |title=The Duck is learning to fly in California and Hawaii|first=Jim |last=Lazar |date=8 August 2016|work=Utility Dive|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mandatory solar power in new homes===

In March 2008, [[Culver City, California|Culver City]] established the first in the nation mandatory solar photovoltaic requirement, which requires an installation of 1 KW of solar photovoltaic power per {{convert|10000|sqft}} of new or major remodeled commercial building area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Culver City Building Safety Division Mandatory Solar Photovoltaic Requirement|url=http://www.culvercity.org/Home/ShowDocument?id=440|website=culvercity.org (official website)|publisher=City of Culver City|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, [[Lancaster, California]] became the first U.S. city to mandate the inclusion of solar panels on new homes, requiring that "every new housing development must average 1 kilowatt per house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In May 2013, [[Sebastopol, California|Sebastopol]] followed suit, requiring new buildings include either 2 W/sq ft (21.7 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of insulated building space of photovoltaics, or enough to provide 75% of the expected annual electricity use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://grist.org/news/sebastopol-requiring-solar-panels-on-all-new-homes/|title=California town of Sebastopol will require solar panels on all new homes|date=2013-05-09|work=Grist|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since January 1, 2014 California law requires all new buildings less than ten stories tall be "solar ready".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_20744057/california-poised-require-solar-ready-roofs-new-homes|title=California poised to require 'solar ready roofs' on new homes and buildings|date=2012-05-30|work=The Mercury News|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, [[San Francisco]] mandated that all new buildings less than ten stories tall include solar panels or solar water heating covering at least 15% of the roof, beginning January 1, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampentland/2016/04/22/san-francisco-becomes-first-major-u-s-city-to-mandate-rooftop-solar-in-new-buildings/|title=San Francisco Becomes First Major U.S. City To Mandate Rooftop Solar In New Buildings|last=Pentland|first=William|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the State of California Building Standards Commission approved solar installation requirements for all new residential buildings with three stories or fewer. This requirement takes effect in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-solar-mandate-20181214-story.html|title=Starting in 2020, all new homes in California must come with solar panels.

===Streamlined permitting===
California governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed a streamlined permitting bill (AB 2188) for residential solar systems on September 22, 2014. AB 2188 has four major provisions designed to reduce red-tape associated with local solar permits and requires that, by the end of September 2015, all California cities and counties must "adopt an ordinance that creates an expedited, streamlined permitting process for residential rooftop solar energy systems of less than 10 kilowatts in size."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/New-California-Law-Cuts-the-Red-Tape-and-Costs-of-Solar-Permitting|title=New California Law Cuts Solar-Permitting Red Tape|author=Eric Wesoff|publisher=GreenTech Media|date=2014-09-22|accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Research and industry reports project the bill could reduce the cost of installing a typical residential solar system in the state by over $1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-solar-permits-assembly-bill-20140822-story.html|title=Assembly bill could lower cost of residential solar in California|author=Chad Garland|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|date=2014-08-23|accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alameda County solar financing===
Using a 20-year property assessment known as [[PACE financing]], the city of [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] had a successful pilot program from 2008 to 2009 as the first city in the country to allow residents to obtain solar power without any initial payment. In the plan, property owners paid as much in increased property taxes as they save in energy costs, allowing them to install the panels for free at no cost to the city. Thirty eight projects are being installed for the pilot stage of the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofberkeley.info/ContentDisplay.aspx?id=26580 Berkeley FIRST] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602054309/http://www.cityofberkeley.info/ContentDisplay.aspx?id=26580 |date=2013-06-02 }} retrieved 4 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; PACE financing has spread to 28 states, but is on hold in many due to objections by [[Freddie Mac]] and [[Fannie Mae]], including in Berkeley (which has not continued the pilot as a result). Legislation has been introduced to require acceptance of PACE financing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ase.org/resources/property-assessed-clean-energy-financing-pace Property Assessed Clean Energy Financing (PACE)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===City of Los Angeles feed-in tariff ===
The [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power|City of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power]] initiated a program on January 11, 2013 to pay up to 17 cents/kWh for electricity generated by up to 100 MW of solar power in a [[feed-in tariff]] program. 
20 MW is reserved for small projects of less than 150&amp;nbsp;kW each. The program could be expanded to 150 MW in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/01/los-angeles-dwp-unveils-solar-power-buyback-program.html|title=Los Angeles DWP unveils solar power buyback program|date=2013-01-11|website=LA Times Blogs - L.A.

==State challenges with solar power ==

Energy storage is becoming a more prominent issue because photovoltaic solar panels can only generate electricity during daylight hours and thermal solar installations can only store energy for up to 10 hours, leaving a window in which the state's energy production must be generated from other sources (natural gas, coal, and nuclear).  To remedy this, different sorts of power storage solutions have been proposed such as batteries, compressed air, and ice generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/04/05/470810118/solar-and-wind-energy-may-be-nice-but-how-can-we-store-it |title=Solar And Wind Energy May Be Nice, But How Can We Store It?|last=Brady|first=Jeff |date=April 5, 2016|website=NPR|access-date=2019-09-15 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160501041117/https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/04/05/470810118/solar-and-wind-energy-may-be-nice-but-how-can-we-store-it | archive-date=2016-05-01 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, [[The San Diego Union-Tribune|The San Diego Union Tribune]] reported that Recurrent Energy (a subsidiary of [[Canadian Solar]]) had proposed a large battery, a 350 MW system, to be installed alongside the proposed Crimson Solar Project. The battery will match the proposed facility's nameplate capacity, and is several times larger than the 130 MW [[Hornsdale Power Reserve]], [[Battery storage power station#Largest grid batteries|the largest lithium battery]] in existence, which was created by [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]] and is located in [[South Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=World's biggest battery could power up in California|last=Roth |first=Sammy|date=12 April 2018|work=The San Diego Union Tribune|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--California has several other large projects--&gt;

Another issue is overproduction which is most common during the summer months. California's solar production was so vast that by 2017, California had to pay Arizona and other states in the region to accept some of its electricity during peak production hours in order to provide relief to its grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California's Solar Energy Overload|url=https://instituteforenergyresearch.org/analysis/californias-solar-energy-overload/ |website=Institute for Energy Research|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

California also has aggressive goals when it comes to [[Zero-emissions vehicle|zero emissions vehicles]] (ZEVs), and the most prominent type is the [[electric car]], which relies on grid power to charge its battery. [[Plug-in hybrid]] cars are also very popular in the state. These types of vehicles add to the demand and burden placed on the electrical grid, which was not designed to support the larger electrical loads required by electric vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://tec.ieee.org/newsletter/january-2014/plug-in-vehicles-generate-new-variables-for-power-grids |title=Plug-in vehicles generate new variables for power grids|last=Sperling|first=Daniel |date=1 October 2013|website=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|access-date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One potential solution is to bypass most of the grid with the installation of rooftop solar panels for daytime charging and making use of home energy storage at night. Some electric companies will also provide discounted rates for car owners who charge their vehicles at night when demand is lower. Some cars can be programmed to stagger their charging cycle thought the night. This leads to a steady rate of charging instead of a large spike in the early evening when most commuters return home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/518066/could-electric-cars-threaten-the-grid/ |title=Could Electric Cars Threaten the Grid?|last=Bullis|first=Kevin |date=16 August 2013|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
The majority of Californians in desert country support large-scale solar development, according to a 2012 survey conducted on behalf of [[BrightSource Energy]]. The survey of more than 1,000 people was conducted throughout Imperial, Inyo, Kern, Riverside, San Bernardino counties in California, where many utility-scale solar projects are underway or planned. Survey results showed that nearly four out of five (almost 80 percent) of people strongly supported development of solar power in their communities. The survey also found that the majority of people were concerned with [[climate change]]. It also found that two-thirds of respondents think renewable energy is important to California's future and that the state and federal government should help provide incentives for renewable energy projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleanenergyauthority.com/solar-energy-news/new-survey-finds-california-desert-supports-solar-022012/ |title=New survey finds most in California desert support solar |author=Chris Meehan |date=February 20, 2012 |work=Clean Energy Authority }}&lt;/ref&gt;
