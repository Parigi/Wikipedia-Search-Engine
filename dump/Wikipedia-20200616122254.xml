[[File:GDP regional Ancient Rome.png|thumb|300px|Total GDP around 1 AD for various regions of the Roman Empire&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/Historical_Statistics/horizontal-file_03-2009.xls | title=Statistics on World Population, GDP and Per Capita GDP, 1–f&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]During the [[Roman Republic]], the '''Roman economy''' was largely [[Agrarian economy|agrarian]], centered on the trading of commodities such as grain and wine.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Garnsey, Peter, et al. The Roman Empire: Economy, Society and Culture. 2nd ed., University of California Press, 2015, www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt9qh25h.&lt;/ref&gt; Financial markets were established through such trade, and financial institutions which extended credit for personal use and public infrastructure, were established primarily through inter-family wealth.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Temin, Peter. “Financial Intermediation in the Early Roman Empire.” The Journal of Economic History, vol. 64, no. 3, 2004, pp. 705–733., www.jstor.org/stable/3874817.&lt;/ref&gt; In times of agricultural and cash shortfall, Roman officials and moneyers tended to respond by coining money; this happened during the prolonged crisis of the [[First Punic War]], and created economic distortion and difficulties. Beginning in the early [[Roman Empire]], the economy, in the sense of using money to express [[price]]s and [[debt]]s, and a basic banking system was formed.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt; [[Roman Emperor|Emperors]] issued coinage stamped with their portraits to disseminate propaganda, to create public goodwill, and to symbolize their wealth and power.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bond|first=Shelagh|date=October 1957|title=The Coinage of the Early Roman Empire|jstor=642136|journal=Greece &amp; Rome|volume=4|issue=2|pages=149–159|doi=10.1017/S001738350001593X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Imperial economy was often unstable, inflated in part by Emperors who issued money to fund high-profile imperial projects such as public building works, or costly wars that offered opportunities for propaganda, but little or no material gain.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;[[Jean Andreau|Andreau]], ''Banking and Business in the Roman World'', p. 2; Harris, "The Nature of Roman Money," n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Solidus Constantine II-heraclea RIC vII 101.jpg|thumb|''Solidus'' issued under [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]], and on the reverse [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]], one of the last deities to appear on Roman coins, gradually transforming into an [[Angel#Christianity|angel]] under Christian rule&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Rufus Fears]], "The Theology of Victory at Rome: Approaches and Problem," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.17.2 (1981), pp. 752 and 824, and in the same volume, "The Cult of Virtues and Roman Imperial Ideology," p. 908.&lt;/ref&gt;|182x182px|alt=]]

The setup of the banking system under the Empire allowed the exchange of extremely large sums without the physical transfer of coins, which led to [[fiat money]]. With no central bank, a professional [[Deposit account|deposit]] banker (''argentarius,'' ''coactor argentarius'', or later ''nummularius'') received and held deposits for a fixed or indefinite term, and lent money to third parties.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;[[Jean Andreau]], ''Banking and Business in the Roman World'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, available capital exceeded the amount needed by borrowers, so loans were made and credit was extended on risky terms.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Harris, "The Nature of Roman Money," in ''The Monetary Systems of the Greeks and Romans'', n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;name=":18"&gt;David Kessler and Peter Temin, "Money and Prices in the Early Roman Empire," in ''The Monetary Systems of the Greeks and Romans,''  in ''The Monetary Systems of the Greeks and Romans'' (Oxford University Press, 2008), n.p.&lt;!--a non-paginated online edition; hope to obtain a paginated copy to supply more specific citations--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The senatorial elite were involved heavily in private lending, both as creditors and borrowers, making loans from their personal fortunes on the basis of social connections.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt; Banks of classical antiquity typically kept [[Fractional reserve banking|less in reserves]] than the full total of customers' deposits, as they had no incentive to ensure that customers' deposits would be insured in the event of a [[bank run]].&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt; It was common consensus among Romans at the time, especially due to [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s ideologies, that anyone involved in commerce should have access to [[Credit (finance)|credit]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[[William V. Harris|W.V. Harris]], "The Nature of Roman Money," in ''The Monetary Systems of the Greeks and Romans'', n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency toward [[fiat money]] caused the [[money supply]] to fluctuate consistently.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Emperors of the [[Antonine dynasty|Antonine]] and [[Severan dynasty|Severan dynasties]] overall [[debasement|debased]] the currency, particularly the [[denarius]], under the pressures of meeting military payrolls.&lt;ref&gt;Harl, ''Coinage in the Roman Economy, 300 B.C. to A.D. 700'', p. 125–136.&lt;/ref&gt; Sudden inflation during the reign of [[Commodus]] damaged the credit market.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In the mid-200s, the supply of [[Coin|specie]] contracted sharply.&lt;ref&gt;Harl, ''Coinage in the Roman Economy, 300 B.C. to A.D. 700'', pp. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]—such as reductions in long-distance trade, disruption of mining operations, and the physical transfer of gold coinage outside the empire by invading enemies—greatly diminished the money supply and the banking sector by the year 300.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, "The Nature of Roman Money," in ''The Monetary Systems of the Greeks and Romans'', n.p.; Harl, ''Coinage in the Roman Economy, 300 B.C. to A.D. 700'', pp. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Roman coinage had long been fiat money or [[fiduciary currency]], general economic anxieties came to a head under [[Aurelian]], and bankers lost confidence in coins legitimately issued by the central government. Despite [[Diocletian]]'s introduction of the gold ''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]'' and monetary reforms, the credit market of the Empire never recovered its former robustness.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

[[File:Panorámica de Las Médulas.jpg|thumb|Landscape resulting from the ''[[ruina montium]]'' mining technique at [[Las Médulas]], [[Roman Spain]], one of the most important gold mines in the Roman Empire]]
The main mining regions of the Empire were Spain (gold, silver, copper, tin, lead); Gaul (gold, silver, iron); Britain (mainly iron, lead, tin), the [[Danubian provinces]] (gold, iron); [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and [[Thracia|Thrace]] (gold, silver); and Asia Minor (gold, silver, iron, tin).  Intensive large-scale mining—of alluvial deposits, and by means of [[open-cast mining]] and [[underground mining]]—took place from the reign of Augustus up to the early 3rd century AD, when the instability of the Empire disrupted production. The gold mines of [[Dacia]], for instance, were no longer available for Roman exploitation after the province was surrendered in 271. Mining seems to have resumed to some extent during the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Mining," in ''Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World'' p. 579.&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention and widespread application of [[hydraulic mining]], namely [[hushing]] and ground-sluicing, aided by the ability of the Romans to plan and execute mining operations on a large scale, allowed various base and precious metals to be extracted on a proto-industrial scale only rarely, if ever, matched until the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 2002, pp. 17–21, 25, 32&lt;/ref&gt; The most common fuel by far for smelting and forging operations, as well as heating purposes, was wood and particularly [[charcoal]], which is nearly twice as efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Cech 2010, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[coal]] was mined in some regions to a fairly large extent: Almost all major coalfields in [[Roman Britain]] were exploited by the late 2nd century AD, and a lively trade along the English [[North Sea]] coast developed, which extended to the continental [[Rhineland]], where [[bituminous coal]] was already used for the smelting of [[iron ore]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1997, pp. 322–324&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Empire completely encircled the Mediterranean, which they called "our sea" ''(mare nostrum)''.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Greene, ''The Archaeology of the Roman Economy'' p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman sailing vessels navigated the Mediterranean as well as the major rivers of the Empire, including the [[Guadalquivir]], [[Ebro]], [[Rhône]], Rhine, [[Tiber]] and Nile.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;W.V. Harris, "Trade," in ''The Cambridge Ancient History: The High Empire A.D. 70–192'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), vol. 11, p. 713.&lt;/ref&gt; Transport by water was preferred where possible, as moving commodities by land was more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, "Trade," in ''CAH'' 11, p. 714.&lt;/ref&gt; Vehicles, wheels, and ships indicate the existence of a great number of skilled woodworkers.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Bradley Ulrich, ''Roman Woodworking'' (Yale University Press, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Land transport utilized the advanced system of [[Roman roads]]. The in-kind taxes paid by communities included the provision of personnel, animals, or vehicles for the ''[[cursus publicus]]'', the state mail and transport service established by Augustus. Relay stations were located along the roads every seven to twelve [[Roman mile]]s, and tended to grow into a village or trading post.&lt;ref name="StambaughThe"&gt;Stambaugh, ''The Ancient Roman City,'' p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[mansio]]'' (plural ''mansiones'') was a privately run service station franchised by the imperial bureaucracy for the ''cursus publicus''. The support staff at such a facility included muleteers, secretaries, blacksmiths, cartwrights, a veterinarian, and a few military police and couriers. The distance between ''mansiones'' was determined by how far a wagon could travel in a day.&lt;ref name="StambaughThe" /&gt; Mules were the animal most often used for pulling carts, travelling about 4&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Laurence, "Land Transport in Roman Italy: Costs, Practice and the Economy," in ''Trade, Traders and the Ancient City'' (Routledge, 1998), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of the pace of communication, it took a messenger a minimum of nine days to travel to Rome from [[Mainz#Roman Mogontiacum|Mainz]] in the province of [[Germania Superior]], even on a matter of urgency.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Hopkins, "The Political Economy of the Roman Empire," in ''The Dynamics of Ancient Empires : State Power from Assyria to Byzantium'' (Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the ''mansiones'', some taverns offered accommodations as well as [[#Food and dining|food and drink]]; one recorded tab for a stay showed charges for wine, bread, mule feed, and the [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|services of a prostitute]].&lt;ref&gt;Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome,'' p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman provinces traded among themselves, but trade extended outside the frontiers to regions [[Romano-Chinese relations|as far away as China]] and [[Gupta Empire|India]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, "Trade," in ''CAH'' 11, p. 713.&lt;/ref&gt; The main [[commodity]] was grain.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, "Trade," in ''CAH'' 11, p. 710.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese trade was mostly conducted overland through middle men along the [[Silk Road]]; Indian trade, however, also occurred by sea from [[Roman Egypt|Egyptian]] ports on the [[Red Sea]]. Also traded were olive oil, various foodstuffs, ''[[garum]]'' ([[fish sauce]]), [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]], ore and manufactured metal objects, fibres and textiles, timber, [[ancient Roman pottery|pottery]], [[Roman glass|glassware]], marble, [[papyrus]], spices and ''[[materia medica]]'', ivory, pearls, and gemstones.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, "Trade," in ''CAH'' 11, pp. 717–729.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though most provinces were capable of producing wine, [[Ancient Rome and wine|regional varietals]] were desirable and wine was a central item of trade. Shortages of ''[[vin ordinaire]]'' were rare.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Corbier, "Coinage, Society, and Economy," in ''Cambridge Ancient History: The Crisis of Empire, A.D. 193–337'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), vol. 12, p. 404; Harris, "Trade," in ''CAH'' 11, p. 719.&lt;/ref&gt; The major suppliers for the city of Rome were the west coast of Italy, southern Gaul, the [[Hispania Tarraconensis|Tarraconensis region]] of Spain, and [[Creta et Cyrenaica|Crete]]. Alexandria, the second-largest city, imported wine from [[Latakia|Laodicea in Syria]] and the Aegean.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, "Trade," in ''CAH'' 11, p. 720.&lt;/ref&gt; At the retail level, taverns or specialty wine shops ''(vinaria)'' sold wine by the jug for carryout and by the drink on premises, with price ranges reflecting quality.&lt;ref&gt;Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome,'' pp. 146–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade in the early [[Roman Empire]] allowed Rome to become as vast and great as it did. Emperor [[Augustus]], despite his intense public and private spending, took control of trade from the government and expanded Roman influence by opening new trading markets in overseas areas such as [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Germany]], and [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Louis C.|date=November 1932|title=The Economic Collapse of the Roman Empire|jstor=3290252|journal=The Classical Journal|volume=28|issue=2|pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rome dominated trade and influence over the world in the age of the [[Roman Empire]] but could not advance in their industrial and manufacturing processes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This ultimately threatened the expanding trading and commerce industries that Augustus brought about, as well as the strong standing of the Empire in the eyes of the Romans and the world.

Whereas the Roman Economy was able to thrive in the first few centuries AD thanks to its advanced trade and commerce, the boom was tempered as their ways of conducting business changed drastically. Due to Augustus and the aristocracy holding the large majority of land and wealth in Rome,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; trade and commerce in the basic everyday commodities began to decline. Trade began to only take place for the more luxurious commodities, effectively excluding the majority of Romans due to their poverty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Foreign trade was also incredibly significant to the rise and complexity of the Roman Economy, and the Romans traded commodities such as wine, oil, grain, salt, arms, and iron to countries primarily in the West.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When those countries came under decline in around 2nd century AD, and respective trade between them and the [[Roman Empire]] had to cease as a result, this put a dent in the strength of the Roman economy as foreign trade was a major factor of economic growth for the superfluously resourced [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Compounded with their inability to make proper production advancements to keep up with their growing and evolving economy, these events hindered Roman trade, limited their array of commodities and harmed the economy.

==Labour and occupations==
[[File:Pompeii - Fullonica of Veranius Hypsaeus 1 - MAN.jpg|thumb|Workers at a cloth-processing shop, in a painting from the ''[[fullonica]]'' of Veranius Hypsaeus in Pompeii]]
Inscriptions record 268 different occupations in the city of Rome, and 85 in Pompeii.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, "The Political Economy of the Roman Empire," p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Professional associations or trade guilds ''(collegia)'' are attested for a wide range of occupations, including fishermen ''(piscatores)'', salt merchants ''(salinatores)'', olive oil dealers ''(olivarii)'', [[Ancient Rome#Art, music and literature|entertainers]] ''(scaenici)'', cattle dealers ''(pecuarii)'', goldsmiths ''(aurifices)'', teamsters ''(asinarii'' or ''muliones)'', and stonecutters ''(lapidarii)''.&lt;ref&gt;Verboven, "The Associative Order: Status and Ethos among Roman Businessmen," preprint pp. 18, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; These are sometimes quite specialized: one ''collegium'' at Rome was strictly limited to craftsmen who worked in ivory and [[citrus wood]].&lt;ref&gt;''Eborarii'' and ''citriarii'': Verboven, "The Associative Order: Status and Ethos among Roman Businessmen," preprint p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Work performed by slaves falls into five general categories: domestic, with epitaphs recording at least 55 different household jobs; [[Slavery in ancient Rome#Servus publicus|imperial or public service]]; urban crafts and services; agriculture; and mining.&lt;ref&gt;"Slavery in Rome," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; Convicts provided much of the labour in the mines or quarries, where conditions were notoriously brutal.&lt;ref&gt;"Slavery in Rome," in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, there was little division of labour between slave and free,&lt;ref name="Saller, p. 111"&gt;Garnsey and Saller, ''The Roman Empire: Economy, Society and Culture'', p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; and most workers were illiterate and without special skills.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Temin, "The Labor Market of the Early Roman Empire," ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 34.1 (2004), p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest number of common labourers were employed in agriculture: in the Italian system of industrial farming ''([[latifundia]])'', these may have been mostly slaves, but throughout the Empire, slave farm labour was probably less important than other forms of dependent labour by people who were technically not enslaved.&lt;ref name="Saller, p. 111"/&gt;

Textile and clothing production was a major source of employment. Both textiles and finished garments were traded among the peoples of the Empire, whose products were often named for them or a particular town, rather like a [[fashion design|fashion "label"]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A.H.M. Jones]], "The Cloth Industry under the Roman Empire," ''Economic History Review'' 13.2 (1960), pp. 184–185.&lt;/ref&gt; Better ready-to-wear was exported by businessmen (''negotiatores'' or ''mercatores'') who were often well-to-do residents of the production centres.&lt;ref name="JonesThe"&gt;Jones, "The Cloth Industry under the Roman Empire,"p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Finished garments might be retailed by their sales agents, who travelled to potential customers, or by ''vestiarii,'' clothing dealers who were mostly freedmen; or they might be peddled by itinerant merchants.&lt;ref name="JonesThe" /&gt; In Egypt, textile producers could run prosperous small businesses employing apprentices, free workers earning wages, and slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, "The Cloth Industry under the Roman Empire," pp. 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fulling|fullers]] (''[[fullonica|fullones]]'') and dye workers (''coloratores'') had their own guilds.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, "The Cloth Industry under the Roman Empire," pp. 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Centonarii'' were guild workers who specialized in textile production and the recycling of old clothes into [[patchwork|pieced goods]].&lt;ref&gt;Vout, "The Myth of the Toga," p. 212. The college of ''centonarii'' is an elusive topic in scholarship, since they are also widely attested as urban firefighters; see Jinyu Liu, ''Collegia Centonariorum: The Guilds of Textile Dealers in the Roman West'' (Brill, 2009). Liu sees them as "primarily tradesmen and/or manufacturers engaged in the production and distribution of low- or medium-quality woolen textiles and clothing, including felt and its products."&lt;/ref&gt;

==GDP and income distribution==
{{Details|Roman economy#Gross domestic product}}
[[Economic history|Economic historians]] vary in their calculations of the gross domestic product of the Roman economy during the Principate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Scheidel|Scheidel, Walter]]; [[Ian Morris (historian)|Morris, Ian]]; Saller, Richard, eds. (2007): ''The Cambridge Economic History of the Greco-Roman World'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-78053-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the sample years of 14, 100, and 150 AD, estimates of per capita GDP range from 166 to 380 ''[[Sestertius|sestertii]]''. The GDP per capita of [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italy]] is estimated as 40&lt;ref name="Lo Cascio, Malanima 2009, 391–401"&gt;[[Elio Lo Cascio|Lo Cascio, Elio]]; [[Paolo Malanima|Malanima, Paolo]] (Dec. 2009): "[http://www.paolomalanima.it/default_file/Papers/GDP_in_Pre-Modern_Agrarian_Economies.pdf GDP in Pre-Modern Agrarian Economies (1–1820 AD). A Revision of the Estimates]", ''Rivista di storia economica'', Vol. 25, No. 3, pp. 391–420 (391–401)&lt;/ref&gt; to 66 percent&lt;ref name="Maddison 2007, pp. 47–51"&gt;Maddison 2007, pp. 47–51&lt;/ref&gt; higher than in the rest of the Empire, due to a more advanced level of urbanization and trade, as well as tax transfers from the provinces and the concentration of elite income in the heartland.

In the [[Walter Scheidel|Scheidel]]–Friesen economic model, the total annual income generated by the Empire is placed at nearly 20 billion ''sestertii'', with about 5 percent extracted by central and local government. Households in the top 1.5 percent of [[income distribution]] captured about 20 percent of income. Another 20 percent went to about 10 percent of the population who can be characterized as a non-elite middle. The remaining "vast majority" produced more than half of the total income, but lived near [[subsistence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scheidel | first1 = Walter | last2 = Friesen | first2 = Steven J. | year = 2009 | title = The Size of the Economy and the Distribution of Income in the Roman Empire | url = | journal = Journal of Roman Studies | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 62–63 | doi=10.3815/007543509789745223}}&lt;/ref&gt; All cited economic historians stress the point that any estimate can only be regarded as a rough approximation to the realities of the ancient economy, given the general paucity of surviving pertinent data.

[[Angus Maddison]] is the only economist cited who offers a detailed breakdown of the [[national disposable income]] (NDI) of the various parts of the Roman Empire. His "highly provisional" estimate (see right) relies on a [[Roman economy#Demography|low-count]] of the Roman population of only 44 million at the time of the death of [[Augustus]] in 14 AD. [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italia]] is considered to have been the richest region, due to tax transfers from the [[Roman province|provinces]] and the concentration of elite income in the heartland; its NDI per capita is estimated at having been between 40%&lt;ref name="Lo Cascio, Malanima 2009, 391–401"/&gt; and 66%&lt;ref name="Maddison 2007, pp. 47–51"/&gt; higher than in the rest of the empire. Besides Italy, the wealthiest province was [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], in terms of NDI per capita.&lt;ref&gt;Maddison 2007, p. 55, table 1.14&lt;/ref&gt;

The European NDI per capita was higher than in the Asian and African provinces if Italy is included, but without it, the rest of Europe had a lower NDI per capita than the Asian and African provinces.&lt;ref name="Maddison 2007, 54, table 1.12"/&gt; The [[Hellenistic]] Eastern provinces ([[Roman Greece|Greece]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia Minor]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]], Egypt) were about 20% wealthier than their mostly Latin-speaking Western counterparts, with Egypt alone being about 28% wealthier. However, Italia, which was not administered as a province, enjoyed a higher per capita income than any one of them.&lt;ref&gt;Maddison 2007, p. 57, table 1.14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxation===
Taxation under the Empire amounted to about 5% of the Empire's [[Roman gross domestic product|gross product]].&lt;ref name="m183"&gt;[[Roman Empire#Morris|Morris]], p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The typical tax rate paid by individuals ranged from 2 to 5%.&lt;ref name="Ando p. 187"&gt;[[#Potter2009|Potter (2009)]], p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; The tax code was "bewildering" in its complicated system of [[direct taxation|direct]] and [[indirect taxes]], some paid in cash and some [[barter|in kind]]. Taxes might be specific to a province, or kinds of properties such as [[fishery|fisheries]] or [[salt evaporation pond]]s; they might be in effect for a limited time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Potter2009|Potter (2009)]], pp. 185–187.&lt;/ref&gt; Tax collection was justified by the need to maintain the military,&lt;ref name="Hopkins p. 184"&gt;[[#Morris|Morris]], p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Potter2009|Potter (2009)]], p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; and taxpayers sometimes got a refund if the army captured a surplus of booty.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Potter2009|Potter (2009)]], p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; In-kind taxes were accepted from less-[[monetization|monetized]] areas, particularly those who could supply grain or goods to army camps.&lt;ref name="administration188"&gt;[[#Potter2009|Potter (2009)]], p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nile river02 pushkin.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Personification of the River Nile and his children, from the [[Serapeum|Temple of Serapis and Isis]] in Rome (1st century AD)]]
The primary source of direct tax revenue was individuals, who paid a [[Tax per head|poll tax]] and a tax on their land, construed as a tax on its produce or productive capacity.&lt;ref name="Ando p. 187"/&gt; Supplemental forms could be filed by those eligible for certain exemptions; for example, Egyptian farmers could register fields as fallow and tax-exempt depending on flood patterns of the [[Nile]].&lt;ref name="Ando p. 186"&gt;[[#Potter2009|Potter (2009)]], p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Tax obligations were determined by the census, which required each head of household to appear before the presiding official and provide a head count of his household, as well as an accounting of property he owned that was suitable for agriculture or habitation.&lt;ref name="Ando p. 186"/&gt;

A major source of indirect-tax revenue was the ''portoria'', customs and tolls on imports and exports, including among provinces.&lt;ref name="Ando p. 187"/&gt; Special taxes were levied on the slave trade. Towards the end of his reign, Augustus instituted a 4% tax on the sale of slaves,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]] 55.31.4.&lt;/ref&gt; which Nero shifted from the purchaser to the dealers, who responded by raising their prices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''Annales'' 13.31.2.&lt;/ref&gt; An owner who manumitted a slave paid a "freedom tax", calculated at 5% of value.&lt;ref&gt;This was the ''vicesima libertatis,'' "the twentieth for freedom"; [[#Potter2009|Potter (2009)]], p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[inheritance tax]] of 5% was assessed when Roman citizens above a certain net worth left property to anyone but members of their immediate family. Revenues from the estate tax and from a 1% sales tax on auctions went towards the veterans' pension fund ''([[aerarium militare]])''.&lt;ref name="Ando p. 187"/&gt;

Low taxes helped the Roman aristocracy increase their wealth, which equalled or exceeded the revenues of the central government. An emperor sometimes replenished his treasury by confiscating the estates of the "super-rich", but in the later period, the [[tax resistance|resistance]] of the wealthy to paying taxes was one of the factors contributing to the collapse of the Empire.&lt;ref name="Hopkins p. 184"/&gt;

==State revenues==

With the conclusion of the [[Third Mithridatic War]] in 63 BC, the [[Roman Republic]] now incorporated the [[Kingdom of Pontus]], [[Cilicia]], most of [[Syria]], and the island of [[Crete]] into its growing dominion, as well as turning the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Kingdom of Judea]] into a [[client state]].&lt;ref name="mclaughlin 2014 p6"/&gt; The Roman historian [[Plutarch]] records that after [[Pompey]]'s return to Rome as a renowned conqueror of [[Eastern Mediterranean|the east]], tablets were presented showing that state revenues had increased from 50 million [[denarii]] to 85 million, an increase from 200 to 340 million [[sesterces]] from new taxes levied.&lt;ref name="mclaughlin 2014 p6"&gt;Raoul McLaughlin (2014). ''The Roman Empire and the Indian Ocean: the Ancient World Economy and the Kingdoms of Africa, Arabia, and India''. Barnsley: Pen &amp; Sword Military. {{ISBN|978-1-78346-381-7}}, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet this was apparently roughly the size of the entire state budget of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] of Hellenistic Egypt. Both [[Cicero]] and [[Strabo]] related how at the beginning of the reign of [[Ptolemy XII Auletes]] (80-51 BC) his kingdom received an annual revenue of 12,500 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]], the equivalent of 75 million denarii, or 300 million sesterces.&lt;ref name="mclaughlin 2014 p6"/&gt; Hence, with the Roman conquest of Egypt in the [[Final War of the Roman Republic]] (32-30 BC) and transformation of Egypt into a [[Roman province]], one would readily assume a considerable increase in state revenues was made. The revenues garnered in Egypt in 80 BC alone was seven times the amount of tax money contemporary [[Roman Gaul]] offered to the Roman coffers following its conquest by [[Julius Caesar]], a mere 40 million sesterces.&lt;ref name="mclaughlin 2014 p6"/&gt; Yet this was roughly the same amount of taxes Rome was able to levy from Egypt (i.e. 40 million sesterces) after its conquest by [[Octavian]], bringing the total figure for state revenues up to 420 million (which included 40 million from newly conquered Egypt, 40 million from Gaul, and 340 million from all other provinces).&lt;ref&gt;Raoul McLaughlin (2014). ''The Roman Empire and the Indian Ocean: the Ancient World Economy and the Kingdoms of Africa, Arabia, and India''. Barnsley: Pen &amp; Sword Military. {{ISBN|978-1-78346-381-7}}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole of [[Roman Britain]] after its conquest produced only about 11 million sesterces in revenues whereas the city of Alexandria in Egypt alone generated roughly 36 million sesterces.&lt;ref name="mclaughlin 2014 p12"&gt;Raoul McLaughlin (2014). ''The Roman Empire and the Indian Ocean: the Ancient World Economy and the Kingdoms of Africa, Arabia, and India''. Barnsley: Pen &amp; Sword Military. {{ISBN|978-1-78346-381-7}}, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gold mining]] from the Roman provinces of [[Hispania]] on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] produced roughly 80 million sesterces every year.&lt;ref name="mclaughlin 2014 p12"/&gt;

During the 1st century AD, the total value of [[Indo-Roman relations|imported goods form the maritime trade]] coming from the [[Indian Ocean]] region (including [[Sino-Roman relations|the silk]] and [[spice trade]]) was roughly 1,000 million sesterces, allowing the Roman state to garner 250 million sesterces of that figure in tax revenue.&lt;ref name="mclaughlin 2014 p14"&gt;Raoul McLaughlin (2014). ''The Roman Empire and the Indian Ocean: the Ancient World Economy and the Kingdoms of Africa, Arabia, and India''. Barnsley: Pen &amp; Sword Military. {{ISBN|978-1-78346-381-7}}, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the reduction of the amount of [[Roman legion]]s from about fifty to twenty-eight (500,000 down to 300,000 full-time soldiers and [[auxilia]]ries) the Roman state under Augustus still had to spend out 640 million sesterces on military costs alone per annum (with total state expenses hovering around 1,000 million).&lt;ref name="mclaughlin 2014 p16"&gt;Raoul McLaughlin (2014). ''The Roman Empire and the Indian Ocean: the Ancient World Economy and the Kingdoms of Africa, Arabia, and India''. Barnsley: Pen &amp; Sword Military. {{ISBN|978-1-78346-381-7}}, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Raoul McLaughlin stresses that "as long as international commerce thrived, the Roman Empire could meet these high-level military costs."&lt;ref name="mclaughlin 2014 p16"/&gt; A further 25 million sesterces in state revenues was gathered by taxing the Roman [[export]]ed goods loaded on ships destined for Arabia and India (worth roughly 100 million in total).&lt;ref name="mclaughlin 2014 p19"&gt;Raoul McLaughlin (2014). ''The Roman Empire and the Indian Ocean: the Ancient World Economy and the Kingdoms of Africa, Arabia, and India''. Barnsley: Pen &amp; Sword Military. {{ISBN|978-1-78346-381-7}}, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical financial crises==

=== The Financial Crisis of 33 A.D. ===
The financial crisis of 33 A.D. is largely considered to be caused by policies that [[Tiberius]] took in order to limit the aristocrats' wealth and land-ownership, and done in response to [[Augustus]]'s massive private and public expenditures. Prior to 33 A.D., Augustus engaged in lavish spending in the public and private sector, while greatly encouraging land ownership and investment in real estate.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=Financial Panic of 33 A.D. ."

As a result, he aggressively engaged in a massive extension of [[Credit (finance)|credit]] into the real estate and public sector, and engaged in riskier and riskier [[loan]]s.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Due to his policies, land and real estate prices rose dramatically, benefitting his wealthy and noble land-owner friends who owned large amounts of property and invested heavily in real estate.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Tiberius noticed such collusion, and looked to curb the amount of land that the wealthy and elites owned, as well as control the rapidly inflating money supply. He engaged in heavy [[austerity]] policies such as ordering for all loans be paid off immediately, and began confiscating property from the wealthy land-owners.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; By restricting loans for land purchasing, and the demand to pay loans in full, debtors were forced to sell off their property and real estate, which drastically dropped real estate and land prices.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Paired with Tiberius' credit restriction policies and the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] naively demanding that people continue to invest in land despite what was going on, massive deflation occurred which ultimately cause the market to collapse.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
