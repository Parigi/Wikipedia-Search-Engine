The '''second-generation iPhone SE''' (also known as the '''iPhone SE 2''' or the '''2020 iPhone SE''') is a [[smartphone]] designed, developed, and marketed by [[Apple Inc.]] It is part of the [[List of iOS devices|13th generation]] of the [[iPhone]], alongside the [[iPhone 11]] and [[iPhone 11 Pro|11 Pro/Pro Max]] models. Announced on April 15, 2020, the iPhone SE directly replaced the [[iPhone 8]] series, while also being the successor to the smaller and lighter [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone SE]]. Pre-orders began on April 17, 2020, and the phone was subsequently released on April 24, 2020.&lt;ref name="release"&gt;{{cite web |author=Apple |date=April 15, 2020 |accessdate=May 6, 2020 |publisher=Apple Newsroom (apple.com) |title=iPhone SE: A powerful new smartphone in a popular design - Apple |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/04/iphone-se-a-powerful-new-smartphone-in-a-popular-design/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200428153235/https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/04/iphone-se-a-powerful-new-smartphone-in-a-popular-design/ |archive-date=April 28, 2020 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released with a starting price of {{currency|399}}, and positioned as a budget phone.&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite web |author=Sareena Dayaram |date=May 6, 2020 |accessdate=May 6, 2020 |publisher=CNET (cnet.com) |title=How iPhone SE 2020 specs compare to old iPhone SE, iPhone 8, iPhone XR, iPhone 11 - CNET |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/iphone-se-2020-specs-compare-old-iphone-se-iphone-8-iphone-xr-iphone-11/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Annie Gaus |date=May 6, 2020 |accessdate=May 11, 2020 |publisher=TheStreet (TheStreet.com) |title=Who Apple Is Targeting With Its New iPhone SE - TheStreet |url=https://www.thestreet.com/investing/apple-takes-aim-at-android-users-with-iphone-se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the pattern set by the [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone SE]] (which shares the dimensions and form factor of the [[iPhone 5S]], with the internal hardware of the [[iPhone 6S]]), the second-generation model shares the dimensions and form factor of the iPhone 8, while sharing selected internal hardware components from the iPhone 11 lineup, including the [[Apple A13|A13 Bionic]] [[system on a chip|system-on-chip]] (as opposed to the [[Apple A11|A11 Bionic]] system-on-chip found in the iPhone 8 series).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Peters|first=Jay|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221293/iphone-se-vs-11-pro-specs-comparison-price-camera-size|title=How the second-gen iPhone SE compares to the iPhone 11|date=15 April 2020|work=The Verge|access-date=18 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200419133930/https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221293/iphone-se-vs-11-pro-specs-comparison-price-camera-size|archive-date=April 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="msn"&gt;{{cite web |author=Stephen Shankland |date=April 24, 2020 |accessdate=May 6, 2020 |publisher=MSN News (MSN.com) |title=iPhone SE outclasses all Android phones thanks to Apple's A13 chip |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/iphone-se-outclasses-all-android-phones-thanks-to-apples-a13-chip/ar-BB139QeU |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200429084339/https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/iphone-se-outclasses-all-android-phones-thanks-to-apples-a13-chip/ar-BB139QeU |archive-date=April 29, 2020 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
A successor to the first-generation iPhone SE had been a source of rumor since 2017, the year after the device was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/22/iphone-se-2-release-date-first-half-2018/ |title = iPhone SE 2 Again Rumored to Launch in First Half of 2018 |website = MacRumors |language = en |access-date = April 15, 2020 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200407171103/https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/22/iphone-se-2-release-date-first-half-2018/ |archive-date = April 7, 2020 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was also subject to speculation. Guesses included (most prevalently) iPhone SE 2, iPhone SE 2020, and iPhone 9 due to design similarities with the iPhone 8.

In March 2020, cases for the phone were reportedly being shipped to [[Best Buy]],&lt;ref name="9to5mac"&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://9to5mac.com/2020/03/30/iphone-9-case-inventory-best-buy/ |title = iPhone 9 case inventory arriving at Best Buy, other retailers with April 5 merchandising date |last = Miller |first = Chance |date = March 30, 2020 |accessdate = April 3, 2020 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200403181051/https://9to5mac.com/2020/03/30/iphone-9-case-inventory-best-buy/ |archive-date = April 3, 2020 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; showing an iPhone with an [[iPhone 8]]-sized body and a single camera lens.&lt;ref name="9to5mac" /&gt; [[Belkin]] screen protectors for the iPhone SE were also listed on the online [[Apple Store]], cross-compatible with the base models of the [[iPhone 6]], [[iPhone 6S]], [[iPhone 7]], and iPhone 8. However, references to the iPhone SE were quickly removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-iphone-9-will-be-the-new-iphone-se |title = iPhone 9 will be called iPhone SE and could launch soon (Update) |website = Tom's Guide |accessdate = April 3, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="9to5mac" /&gt; 

On April 15, 2020, the second-generation iPhone SE was announced in a press release note on Apple's website.&lt;ref name="release" /&gt; It was marketed as "A powerful new smartphone in a popular design", and was released worldwide on April 24, 2020.&lt;ref name="release" /&gt;

== Specifications == 
=== Design ===
The iPhone SE features an aluminum frame, with glass front and back. It shares the same physical sizes and dimensions as the [[iPhone 8]], except for a centered Apple logo and no iPhone branding. Therefore, phone cases designed to fit the iPhone 8 will also fit the iPhone SE. The second-generation iPhone SE also shares the same top and bottom bezels as the iPhone 8, including the Home button (integrated with the same second-generation [[Touch ID]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/ |title = iPhone SE 2020: Everything We Know |website = MacRumors |language = en |access-date = April 15, 2020 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180805112853/https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/ |archive-date = August 5, 2018 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iPhone SE is available in three colors: Black, White, and a [[Product Red]] edition.&lt;ref name="Apple official website: specifications"/&gt; Though the offered colors line up with those of the iPhone 8 (Silver, Space Gray, and Product Red respectively, with no equivalent to the Gold model), the iPhone SE uses a noticeably deeper shade of black, a brighter shade of white, and a lighter shade of Product Red. Unlike the silver iPhone 8 (and all prior white and silver iPhones since the [[iPhone 4]]), the 2020 iPhone SE features black bezels around the display on all models, in line with the color schemes of the [[iPhone 11]] and [[iPhone XR]].

==== Size ====
With a screen diagonal of {{cvt|4.7|in}}, the second generation of the iPhone SE was among the smallest mainstream in-production smartphones at the time of its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Axon|first=Samuel|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/04/why-apple-has-stopped-making-small-phones-and-why-it-should-start-again/|title=Why Apple has stopped making small phones—and why it should start again|date=18 April 2020|work=Ars Technica|access-date=18 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200418210930/https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/04/why-apple-has-stopped-making-small-phones-and-why-it-should-start-again/|archive-date=April 18, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is still thirty percent larger than the first generation variant, whose screen diagonal measures {{cvt|4|in}}. Dan Seifert from [[The Verge]] declared the second-generation SE a "nail in the coffin" for small phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Seifert|first=Dan|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222642/iphone-se-2-size-comparison-small-phone-trend-galaxy-oneplus|title=Even ‘small’ phones are big now|date=15 April 2020|work=The Verge|access-date=18 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200422010715/https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222642/iphone-se-2-size-comparison-small-phone-trend-galaxy-oneplus|archive-date=April 22, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was affirmed by [[CNET]], who stated that "Apple's decision to not build a brand-new 4-inch phone is telling. It signals that the company will probably never bring back the tiny iPhone, no matter how badly people crave it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sareena Dayaram |date=May 10, 2020 |accessdate=May 11, 2020 |publisher=CNET (cnet.com) |title=iPhone SE is not as small as people want it to be.

The iPhone SE incorporates the Apple A13 Bionic [[system on a chip]] (SoC), with the integrated [[Apple motion coprocessors|M13 motion coprocessor]], and third-generation neural engine.&lt;ref name="msn" /&gt; It is available in three internal storage configurations: 64 GB, 128 GB, and 256 GB.&lt;ref name="Apple official website: specifications" /&gt; The SE has the same [[IP Code|IP67]] rating for dust and water resistance as the iPhone 8.&lt;ref name="Apple official website: specifications" /&gt; The phone lacks the [[ultra-wideband]] features enabled by the [[Apple-designed processors#Apple U1|U1 chip]] found in the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/04/15/apples-new-iphone-se-doesnt-have-a-u1-ultra-wideband-chip|title=Apple's new iPhone SE doesn't have a U1 Ultra Wideband chip|website=appleinsider|last=Peterson|first=Mike|date=April 15, 2020|access-date=April 16, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416075006/https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/04/15/apples-new-iphone-se-doesnt-have-a-u1-ultra-wideband-chip|archive-date=April 16, 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iPhone Hacks"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iphonehacks.com/2020/04/2020-iphone-se-misses-features.html|title=2020 iPhone SE Misses Out On These 5 Features|last=|first=|date=|website=iPhone Hacks|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200426154415/http://www.iphonehacks.com/2020/04/2020-iphone-se-misses-features.html|archive-date=April 26, 2020|access-date=April 26, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the phone's smaller size which may lead to increased thermal throttling, the SE's A13 SoC runs at the same peak CPU frequencies as the iPhone 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Frumusanu |first1=Andrei |title=The iPhone SE (2020) Hands-On Quick Review: A Reinvigorated Classic |url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/15745/the-iphone-se-2020-quick-review-reinvigorated-classic/2 |website=AnandTech |accessdate=May 2, 2020 |date=April 24, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200504015401/https://www.anandtech.com/show/15745/the-iphone-se-2020-quick-review-reinvigorated-classic/2 |archive-date=May 4, 2020 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the first-generation model, the second-generation iPhone SE doesn't feature a standard 3.5 mm [[Phone connector (audio)|stereo headphone jack]].&lt;ref name="cnet" /&gt;

==== Display ====
The iPhone SE features the same Retina HD display found on the iPhone 8, using [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]] technology with True Tone and wide color gamut ([[DCI-P3#Display P3|Display P3]]). The display has a resolution of 1334 x 750 pixels, like the previous 4.7" iPhones. The pixel density is 326 PPI, the same as on all iPhones with LCD displays since the introduction of the Retina display on the [[iPhone 4]], excluding the Plus models. The pressure-sensing [[Force Touch|3D Touch]] feature found on the iPhone 8 has been replaced with [[Force Touch|Haptic Touch]] on the iPhone SE, which does not work for notifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/27/iphone-se-haptic-touch-notifications/|title=PSA: iPhone SE's Haptic Touch Doesn't Work With Notifications and It's Not a Bug|website=MacRumors|date=27 April 2020|accessdate=28 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200428103225/https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/27/iphone-se-haptic-touch-notifications/|archive-date=April 28, 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can play [[HDR10]] and [[Dolby Vision]] content despite not having an HDR-ready display, done by down-converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to [[dynamic range]], contrast, and wide [[Gamut|color gamut]] compared to [[standard-dynamic-range video|standard]] content.&lt;ref name="release" /&gt;

==== Camera ====
The iPhone SE features a single 12 MP rear camera, similar to the single camera system of the [[iPhone 8]], capable of recording 4K video (at 24, 30, or 60 fps), 1080p HD video (at 30, or 60 fps), or 720p HD video (at 30 fps). The camera has an aperture of f/1.8, [[autofocus]], [[Image stabilization#Optical image stabilization|optical image stabilization]], and a quad-LED True Tone flash. The phone can also take panoramas up to 63 MP, and shoot photos in burst mode. The front camera is 7 MP with an [[aperture]] of f/2.2 and autofocus, capable of shooting 1080p HD video at 30 fps.&lt;ref name="Apple official website: specifications" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_se_(2020)-10170.php|title=Apple iPhone SE (2020)|last=|first=|date=|website=GSMArena|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200426095450/https://www.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_se_(2020)-10170.php|archive-date=April 26, 2020|access-date=April 26, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The camera interface adopts "Quicktake" from the 11 and 11 Pro, which allows the user to long-press the shutter button to take a video.&lt;ref&gt;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210571&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Apple official website: specifications" /&gt; The burst function can now be accessed by swiping the shutter button to the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=How to Take Burst Photos on iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro|url=https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/take-burst-photos-iphone-11-pro/|website=MacRumors|language=en|access-date=2020-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new [[Image processor|image signal processor]] and neural engine of the SE support several camera functions not supported on the iPhone 8. Like the 11 and 11 Pro, the rear camera supports next-generation Smart HDR.&lt;ref name="release" /&gt; The rear camera also supports extended dynamic range video up to 30 fps, stereo recording and cinematic video stabilization. Both the front and rear cameras of the iPhone SE support Portrait mode and Portrait Lighting.&lt;ref name="release" /&gt; Like the 11 and 11 Pro, Portrait mode has depth control and an advanced [[Bokeh|bokeh effect]] (blurring effect of the [[Defocus aberration|out-of-focus]] background around the portrait). However, the usage of older sensor hardware results in some limitations—the iPhone SE does not support the Night Mode or Deep Fusion features of the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulmonckton/2020/04/28/new-iphone-se-2-teardown-camera-iphone8-ifixit-deep-fusion/#4ac9a4b7683a|title=New iPhone SE 2 Reports Cause Serious Questions To Be Asked|work=[[Forbes]]|last=Monckton|first=Paul|date=28 April 2020|accessdate=28 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200429005033/https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulmonckton/2020/04/28/new-iphone-se-2-teardown-camera-iphone8-ifixit-deep-fusion/#4ac9a4b7683a|archive-date=April 29, 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SE's implementation of Portrait mode only natively supports images of humans, as the hardware does not produce depth maps through the use of [[Auto focus#Phase detection|focus pixels]] and instead relies on software-based machine learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=iPhone SE: The One-Eyed King?|url=https://blog.halide.cam/iphone-se-the-one-eyed-king-96713d65a3b1|last=Sandofsky|first=Ben|date=April 27, 2020|work=[[Medium (website)|Medium]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200428044005/https://blog.halide.cam/iphone-se-the-one-eyed-king-96713d65a3b1|archive-date=April 28, 2020|access-date=April 27, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
