'''Swans''' are [[bird]]s of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Anatidae]] within the genus '''''Cygnus'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ENCYCLOPÆDIA BRITANNICA Swan |url=https://www.britannica.com/animal/swan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The swans' closest relatives include the [[goose|geese]] and [[duck]]s. Swans are grouped with the closely related geese in the [[subfamily]] [[Anserinae]] where they form the [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] '''Cygnini'''. Sometimes, they are considered a distinct subfamily, '''Cygninae'''. There are six living (and many [[extinct]]) species of swan; in addition, there is a species known as the [[coscoroba swan]] which is no longer considered one of the '''true swans'''. Swans usually [[mate for life]], although “divorce” sometimes occurs, particularly following nesting failure, and if a mate dies, the remaining swan will take up with another. The number of [[bird egg|eggs]] in each [[:wikt:clutch|clutch]] ranges from three to eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Swan Breeding Profile: Pairing, Incubation, Nesting / Raising of Young |url=https://www.beautyofbirds.com/swanbreeding.html |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and terminology==
The English word 'swan', akin to the [[German language|German]] ''Schwan'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''zwaan'' and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''svan'', is derived from [[Indo-European root]] ''*swen'' (to sound, to sing).&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|swan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young swans are known as ''[[wikt:swanling|swanlings]]'' or as ''[[wikt:cygnet|cygnets]]''; the latter derives via [[Old French]] ''cigne'' or ''cisne'' (diminutive suffix -''[[wikt:-et#Old French|et]]'' "little") from the [[Latin]] word ''{{wiktla|cygnus}}'', a variant form of ''cycnus'' "swan", itself from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|κύκνος}} ''kýknos'', a word of the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|cycnus1|cycnus|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|ku/knos|κύκνος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|cygnet}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adult male is a ''cob'', from Middle English ''cobbe'' (leader of a group); an adult female is a ''pen''.&lt;ref name=PeterYoung&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Peter |title=Swan |date=2008 |publisher=Reaktion |location=London |isbn=978-1-86189-349-9 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Schwanflug22.jpg|thumb|[[Mute swan]] landing on water. Due to the size and weight of most swans, large areas of open land or water are required to successfully take off and land.]]
Swans are the largest extant members of the waterfowl family [[Anatidae]], and are among the largest flying birds. The largest species, including the [[mute swan]], [[trumpeter swan]], and [[whooper swan]], can reach a length of over {{convert|1.5|m|in|abbr=on}} and weigh over {{convert|15|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Their wingspans can be over {{convert|3.1|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Madge"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Madge |first=Steve |last2=Burn |first2=Hilary |title=Waterfowl: An Identification Guide to the Ducks, Geese, and Swans of the World |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1988 |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-395-46727-5 |pages= |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/waterfowl00stev }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the closely related geese, they are much larger and have proportionally larger feet and necks.&lt;ref name="Ducks"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Ducks, Geese and Swans |editor=Kear, Janet |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |series=Bird Families of the World |isbn=978-0-19-861008-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Quite unusual for birds, swans have "teeth" - jagged parts of their bill that are used for catching and eating fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://carolinabirds.org/HTML/Duck_Swan.htm|title=Birds of The World: Swans (Anatidae)|website=carolinabirds.org|access-date=2019-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults also have a patch of unfeathered skin between the eyes and bill. The sexes are alike in [[plumage]], but males are generally bigger and heavier than females.&lt;ref name=PeterYoung/&gt;

The Northern Hemisphere species of swan have pure white plumage but the Southern Hemisphere species are mixed black and white. The Australian [[black swan]] (''Cygnus atratus'') is completely black except for the white flight feathers on its wings; the chicks of black swans are light grey. The South American [[black-necked swan]] has a white body with a black neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Peter |title=Swan |date=2008 |publisher=Reaktion |location=London |isbn=978-1-86189-349-9 |pages=18–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swans' legs are normally a dark blackish grey colour, except for the two South American species, which have pink legs. Bill colour varies: the four [[subarctic]] species have black bills with varying amounts of yellow, and all the others are patterned red and black. Although birds do not have teeth, swans have beaks with serrated edges that look like small jagged 'teeth' as part of their beaks used for catching and eating aquatic plants and algae, but also molluscs, small fish, frogs, and worms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/m/muteswan/feeding.aspx "Mute Swan.

==Distribution and movements==
{{See also|List of Anseriformes by population}}
[[File:Whooper-swan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Whooper swan]]s migrate from [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]], [[Scandinavia]], and Northern [[Russia]] to [[Europe]], [[Central Asia]], [[China]], and [[Japan]]]]

Swans are generally found in temperate environments, rarely occurring in the tropics. A group of swans is called a bevy or a wedge&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lipton|first=James|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AVNazQEACAAJ|title=An Exaltation of Larks|date=1991|publisher=Viking|isbn=978-0-670-30044-0|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in flight. Four (or five) species occur in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], one species is found in [[Australia]], one [[extinct]] species was found in [[New Zealand]] and the [[Chatham Islands]], and one species is distributed in southern South America. They are absent from tropical [[Asia]], [[Central America]], northern [[South America]] and the entirety of [[Africa]]. One species, the [[mute swan]], has been [[introduced species|introduced]] to [[North America]], [[Australia]] and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Ducks" /&gt;

Several species are [[bird migration|migratory]], either wholly or partly so. The mute swan is a partial migrant, being resident over areas of Western Europe but wholly migratory in Eastern Europe and Asia. The whooper swan and tundra swan are wholly migratory, and the trumpeter swans are almost entirely migratory.&lt;ref name="Ducks" /&gt; There is some evidence that the [[black-necked swan]] is migratory over part of its range, but detailed studies have not established whether these movements are long or short range migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Schlatter |first=Roberto |last2=Navarro |first2=Rene A. |last3=Corti |first3=Paulo |year=2002 |title=Effects of El Nino Southern Oscillation on Numbers of Black-Necked Swans at Rio Cruces Sanctuary, Chile |journal=Waterbirds |volume=25 |issue=Special Publication 1 |pages=114–122 |jstor=1522341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behaviour==
[[File:Courting swan on Danube.jpg|thumb|left|Courting swan on [[Danube]]]]
Swans feed in water and on land. They are almost entirely herbivorous, although they may eat small amounts of aquatic animals. In the water, food is obtained by up-ending or dabbling, and their diet is composed of the roots, tubers, stems and leaves of aquatic and submerged plants.&lt;ref name="Ducks" /&gt;

Swans famously mate for life, and typically bond even before they reach sexual maturity.  Trumpeter swans, for example, who can live as long as 24 years and only start breeding at the age of 4–7, form monogamous [[pair bond]]s as early as 20 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=Drew |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYyqe06fpS0C&amp;pg=PA35 |journal=National Parks |date=March–April 1998 |volume=72 |issue=3–4 |page=35 |title=Gaining Ground: A Swan's Song |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326224550/http://books.google.com/books?id=AYyqe06fpS0C&amp;pg=PA35 |archive-date=2014-03-26 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Divorce", though rare, does occur; one study of mute swans showing a 3% rate for pairs that breed successfully and 9% for pairs that do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.audubon.org/news/till-death-do-them-part-8-birds-mate-life/|title= Till Death do them Part: 8 Birds that Mate for Life |first=Michele|last=Berger|date=11 June 2018|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|accessdate=11 June 2018|via= www.audubon.org |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair bonds are maintained year-round, even in gregarious and migratory species like the [[tundra swan]], which congregate in large flocks in the wintering grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Scott |first=D. K. |year=1980 |title=Functional aspects of the pair bond in winter in Bewick's swans (''Cygnus columbianus bewickii'') |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=323–327 |doi=10.1007/BF00300673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swan's nests are on the ground near water and about a metre across. Unlike many other ducks and geese, the male helps with the nest construction, and also take turns incubating the eggs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Scott |first1=Dafila |title=Swans |date=1995 |publisher=Colin Baxter Photography |location=Grantown-on-Spey, Scotland |isbn=978-0-948661-63-1 |page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; and alongside the [[whistling duck]]s are the only anatids that will do this. Average egg size (for the mute swan) is 113×74&amp;nbsp;mm, weighing 340 g, in a clutch size of 4 to 7, and an incubation period of 34–45 days.&lt;ref name="BTO"&gt;[http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob1520.htm "Mute Swan"].

Swans are highly protective of their nests. They will viciously attack anything that they perceive as a threat to their chicks, including humans. One man was suspected to have drowned in such an attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Waldren |first=Ben |date=16 April 2012 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/killer-swan-blamed-mans-drowning-120835237--abc-news-topstories.html |title=Killer Swan Blamed for Man's Drowning |publisher=Yahoo News |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140807182722/http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/killer-swan-blamed-mans-drowning-120835237--abc-news-topstories.html |archive-date=7 August 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17736292 |work=BBC News |title=Who, What, Why: How dangerous are swans? |date=17 April 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417181615/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17736292 |archive-date=17 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systematics and evolution==
[[File:Black-necked swan 745r.jpg|thumb|Black-necked swan at [[WWT London Wetland Centre]]]]
[[File:Granja comary Cisne - Escalavrado e Dedo De Deus ao fundo -Teresópolis.jpg|thumb|Black swan in [[Teresópolis]], [[Brazil]]]]
Evidence suggests that the genus ''Cygnus'' evolved in Europe or western Eurasia during the [[Miocene]], spreading all over the Northern Hemisphere until the [[Pliocene]]. When the southern species branched off is not known. The mute swan apparently is closest to the Southern Hemisphere ''Cygnus'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=del Hoyo et al., eds |title=Handbook of the Birds of the World, Volume 1 |date=1992 |publisher=Lynx Edicions}}&lt;/ref&gt; its habits of carrying the neck curved (not straight) and the wings fluffed (not flush) as well as its bill color and knob indicate that its closest living relative is the black swan. Given the [[biogeography]] and appearance of the [[subgenus]] ''Olor'' it seems likely that these are of a more recent origin, as evidence shows by their modern ranges (which were mostly uninhabitable during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]]) and great similarity between the taxa.&lt;ref name="Northcote 1981" /&gt;

===Species===
'''Genus ''Cygnus'''''
* Subgenus ''Olor''
**[[Mute swan]], ''Cygnus olor'', is a Eurasian species that occurs at lower latitudes than whooper swan and Bewick's swan across Europe into southern Russia, China and the Russian Maritimes. Recent fossil records, according to the British Ornithological Union, show ''Cygnus olor'' is among the oldest bird species still extant and it has been upgraded to "native" status in several European countries, since this bird has been found in fossil and bog specimens dating back thousands of years. Common temperate Eurasian species, often semi-domesticated descendants of domestic flocks, are naturalized in the United States and elsewhere.
* Subgenus ''Chenopis''
**[[Black swan]], ''Cygnus atratus'' of Australia, and introduced in New Zealand
* Subgenus ''Sthenelides''
**[[Black-necked swan]], ''Cygnus melancoryphus'' of South America
* Subgenus ''Cygnus''
**[[Whooper swan]], ''Cygnus cygnus'' breeds in [[Iceland]] and subarctic Europe and Asia, migrating to temperate Europe and Asia in winter
**[[Trumpeter swan]], ''Cygnus buccinator'' is the largest North American swan. Very similar to the whooper swan (and sometimes treated as a subspecies of it), it was hunted almost to [[extinction]] but has since recovered
**[[Tundra swan]], ''Cygnus columbianus'' breeds on the arctic tundra and winters in more temperate regions of [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]]. It consists of two forms, generally considered to be subspecies.
***Bewick's swan, ''Cygnus'' (''columbianus'') ''bewickii'' is the Eurasian form that migrates from Arctic Russia to western Europe and eastern Asia (China, Korea, Japan) in winter.
***Whistling swan, ''Cygnus'' (''columbianus'') ''columbianus'' is the North American form.

The [[coscoroba swan]] (''Coscoroba coscoroba'') from South America, the only species of its genus, is apparently not a true swan. Its phylogenetic position is not fully resolved; it is in some aspects more similar to [[geese]] and [[shelduck]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.zoo.org/page.aspx?pid=1842#.V6a615MrI6g |title=COSCOROBA SWAN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808082000/https://www.zoo.org/page.aspx?pid=1842 |archivedate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fossil record===
[[File:Black Swan skeleton.jpg|thumb|324x324px|[[Black swan]] skeleton ([[Museum of Osteology]])]] &lt;!--not actually a fossil--&gt;

The [[fossil record]] of the genus ''Cygnus'' is quite impressive, although allocation to the subgenera is often tentative; as indicated above, at least the early forms probably belong to the ''C. olor'' – Southern Hemisphere lineage, whereas the Pleistocene taxa from North America would be placed in ''Olor''. A number of prehistoric species have been described, mostly from the Northern Hemisphere. In the Mediterranean, the leg bones of the giant swan ''[[Cygnus falconeri|C. falconeri]]'' was found on the islands of [[Malta]] and [[Sicily]], may have been over 2 meters from tail to bill which was taller (though not heavier) than the contemporary local dwarf elephants (''[[Palaeoloxodon falconeri]]'').

==In culture==
{{See also|Black swan emblems and popular culture| Swan upping | Swan maiden}}

===European motifs===
Many of the cultural aspects refer to the mute swan of Europe. Perhaps the best known story about a swan is "[[The Ugly Duckling]]" fable. Swans are often a symbol of love or fidelity because of their long-lasting, apparently monogamous relationships. See [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] famous swan-related operas ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The opera novice: Wagner's Lohengrin |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/opera/10098850/The-opera-novice-Wagners-Lohengrin.html |website=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=2 December 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203124010/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/opera/10098850/The-opera-novice-Wagners-Lohengrin.html |archive-date=3 December 2016 |df=|date=2013-06-04 |last1=Rahim |first1=Sameer }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Parsifal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The opera novice: Parsifal by Richard Wagner |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/opera/9908198/The-opera-novice-Parsifal-by-Richard-Wagner.html |website=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=2 December 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220161837/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/opera/9908198/The-opera-novice-Parsifal-by-Richard-Wagner.html |archive-date=20 December 2016 |df=|date=2013-03-05 |last1=Rahim |first1=Sameer }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===As food===
Swan meat was regarded as a luxury food in England in the reign of [[Elizabeth I]]. A recipe for baked swan survives from that time: "To bake a Swan Scald it and take out the bones, and parboil it, then season it very well with Pepper, Salt and Ginger, then lard it, and put it in a deep Coffin of Rye Paste with store of Butter, close it and bake it very well, and when it is baked, fill up the Vent-hole with melted Butter, and so keep it; serve it in as you do the Beef-Pie."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.elizabethan-era.org.uk/bake-swan-old-recipe.htm |title=Baked Swan. Old Elizabethan Recipe |publisher=elizabethan-era.org.uk |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027032709/http://elizabethan-era.org.uk/bake-swan-old-recipe.htm |archive-date=2010-10-27 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heraldics===
[[File:Accession of ten new countries to the European Union Reverse.jpg|thumb|upright=.6|A swan depicted on an [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Ireland)|Irish commemorative coin]] in celebration of its EU presidency]]
[[File:Herb Łabędź 1.svg|thumb|left|upright|"[[Łabędź coat of arms|Łabędź]]" ([[Polish language|Polish]] for "Swan") is a [[Polish heraldry|Polish–Lithuanian coat of arms]] which was used by many Polish ''[[szlachta]]'' and Lithuanian ''[[Bajorai]]'' (noble) families under the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The variant here given is the coat-of-arms of writer [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]'s family.]]

===Greek mythology===
Swans feature strongly in [[mythology]]. In [[Greek mythology]], the story of [[Leda and the Swan]] recounts that [[Helen of Troy]] was conceived in a union of [[Zeus]] disguised as a swan and [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]], Queen of [[Sparta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Peter |title=Swan |date=2008 |publisher=Reaktion |location=London |isbn=978-1-86189-349-9 |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other references in classical literature include the belief that upon death the [[mute swan]] would sing beautifully—hence the phrase [[swan song]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is the origin of the phrase 'Swan song'? |url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/swan-song.html |publisher=phrases.org.uk |access-date=2 December 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205093619/http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/swan-song.html |archive-date=5 December 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Juvenal]] made a sarcastic reference to a good woman being a "rare bird, as rare on earth as a black swan", from which we get the Latin phrase ''{{wiktla|rara avis}}'', rare bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Peter |title=Swan |date=2008 |publisher=Reaktion |location=London |isbn=978-1-86189-349-9 |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mute swan is also one of the sacred birds of [[Apollo]], whose associations stem both from the nature of the bird as a symbol of light as well as the notion of a "swan song". The god is often depicted riding a chariot pulled by or composed of swans in his ascension from [[Delos]].

===Irish lore and poetry===
The [[Ireland|Irish]] legend of the [[Children of Lir]] is about a stepmother transforming her children into swans for 900 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Fate of the Children of Lir |url=http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/celtic/ctexts/lir.html |website=ancienttexts.org |access-date=2 December 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904192107/http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/celtic/ctexts/lir.html |archive-date=4 September 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the legend ''[[Tochmarc Étaíne|The Wooing of Etain]]'', the king of the [[Sidhe]] (subterranean-dwelling, supernatural beings) transforms himself and the most beautiful woman in Ireland, Etain, into swans to escape from the king of Ireland and Ireland's armies. The swan has recently been depicted on an [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Ireland)#2004 coinage|Irish commemorative coin]].

Swans are also present in Irish literature in the poetry of [[W.B. Yeats]]. [[The Wild Swans at Coole (poem)|"The Wild Swans at Coole"]] has a heavy focus on the mesmerising characteristics of the swan. Yeats also recounts the myth of Leda and the Swan in [[Leda and the Swan#In poetry|the poem of the same name]].

===Scandinavian lore===
In [[Norse mythology]], there are two swans that drink from the sacred [[Well of Urd]] in the realm of [[Asgard]], home of the [[Aesir|gods]]. According to the [[Prose Edda]], the water of this well is so pure and holy that all things that touch it turn white, including this original pair of swans and all others descended from them. The poem ''[[Volundarkvida]]'', or the ''Lay of Volund'', part of the [[Poetic Edda]], also features swan maidens.

In the [[Finland|Finnish]] epic ''[[Kalevala]]'', a swan lives in the Tuoni river located in [[Tuonela]], the underworld realm of the dead. According to the story, whoever killed a swan would perish as well. [[Jean Sibelius]] composed the ''[[Lemminkäinen Suite]]'' based on Kalevala, with the second piece entitled ''[[Swan of Tuonela]]'' ''(Tuonelan joutsen)''. Today, five flying swans are the symbol of the [[Nordic Countries]], the [[whooper swan]] (''Cygnus cygnus'') is the national bird of Finland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Whooper Swan |url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/teacher_resources/best_place_species/current_top_10/whooper_swan.cfm |website=wwf.panda.org |access-date=2 December 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203060741/http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/teacher_resources/best_place_species/current_top_10/whooper_swan.cfm |archive-date=3 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[mute swan]] is the national bird of [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BIRDS OF DENMARK |url=http://www.birdlist.org/denmark.htm |website=birdlist.org |access-date=2 December 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305001210/http://www.birdlist.org/denmark.htm |archive-date=5 March 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Swan Lake'' ballet===
The ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'' is among the most canonic of classical ballets. Based on the 1875–76 score by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], the most promulgated choreographic version was created by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov (1895), the premiere of which was danced by the Imperial Ballet at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg. The ballet's lead dual roles of Odette (white swan) / Odile (black swan) represent good and evil,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/arts/dance/odette-odile-in-swan-lake.html |title = All About Odette, Tchaikovsky's Swan Queen|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2018-06-12|last1 = MacAulay|first1 = Alastair}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are among the most challenging roles&lt;ref&gt;The ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'' is among the most canonic of classical ballets.

===Rabelais===
French satirist [[François Rabelais]] wrote in [[Gargantua and Pantagruel]] that a swan's neck was the best toilet paper he had encountered.

===Christianity===
[[File:Hug-lin-pi.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|St [[Hugh of Lincoln]] with swan]]
A swan is one of the attributes of St [[Hugh of Lincoln]] based on the story of a swan who was devoted to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Peter |title=Swan |date=2008 |publisher=Reaktion |location=London |isbn=978-1-86189-349-9 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish language literature===
In [[Latin American literature]], the [[Nicaragua]]n poet [[Rubén Darío]] (1867–1916) consecrated the swan as a symbol of artistic inspiration by drawing attention to the constancy of swan imagery in [[Western culture]], beginning with the rape of Leda and ending with [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''Lohengrin''. Darío's most famous poem in this regard is ''Blasón – "Coat of Arms"'' (1896), and his use of the swan made it a symbol for the [[Modernismo]] poetic movement that dominated Spanish language poetry from the 1880s until the First World War. Such was the dominance of Modernismo in Spanish language poetry that the Mexican poet [[Enrique González Martínez]] attempted to announce the end of Modernismo with a [[sonnet]] provocatively entitled, ''[[Tuércele el cuello al cisne]] – "Wring the Swan's Neck"'' (1910).

===Hinduism===
{{See also|Hamsa (bird)}}
Swans are revered in [[Hinduism]], and are compared to saintly persons whose chief characteristic is to be in the world without getting attached to it, just as a swan's feather does not get wet although it is in water. The [[Sanskrit]] word for swan is ''hamsa'' and the "Raja Hamsam" or the Royal Swan is the vehicle of Goddess [[Saraswati]] which symbolises the "Sattva Guna" or purity par excellence. The swan if offered a mixture of milk and water, is said to be able to drink the milk alone. Therefore, Goddess Saraswati the goddess of knowledge is seen riding the swan because the swan thus symbolizes "Viveka" i.e. prudence and discrimination between the good and the bad or between the eternal and the transient. This is taken as great quality, as shown by this [[Sanskrit]] verse:

{| style="width=100%;"
|width=50% valign=top|
:haṁsaḥ śvētō bakaḥ śvētaḥ kō bhēdō bakahaṁsayōḥ ।
:kṣīranīravivēkē tu haṁsō haṁsō bakō bakaḥ ॥
|width=50% valign=top|
:The swan is white, the crane is white, what is the difference between the swan and the crane?
:During discriminating between water and milk, the swan is a swan while the crane is a crane!
|}
It is mentioned several times in the [[Vedas|Vedic]] literature, and persons who have attained great spiritual capabilities are sometimes called [[Paramahamsa]] ("Supreme Swan") on account of their [[divine grace|spiritual grace]] and ability to travel between various spiritual worlds. In the Vedas, swans are said to reside in the summer on [[Lake Manasarovar]] and migrate to Indian lakes for the winter. They're believed to possess some powers such as the ability to eat pearls.

===Indo-European religions===
Swans are intimately associated with the [[divine twins]] in Indo-European religions, and it is thought that in [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European times]], swans were a solar symbol associated with the divine twins and the original Indo-European [[sun goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Brien |first=Steven |title=Dioscuric Elements in Celtic and Germanic Mythology |journal=Journal of Indo-European Studies |volume=10 |issue=1 &amp; 2 |year=1982 |pages=117–136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black swans===
The [[Black Swan theory]] originates from the erroneous presumption in [[Ancient Rome]] that black swans didn't exist, leading to the black swan as a metaphor for something that could, in theory exist, but doesn't.  After the "discovery" of actual black swans, this became a metaphor or analogy for something, typically an unexpected event or [[outlier]], that has an unforeseen significance.
