'''Milicianas''' fought '''in the Spanish Civil War'''.  They came from a culture with iconic fighters, and where women had been recently empowered through direct political engagement in political organizations and labor unions. The [[Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera]] saw women take more to the streets to protest and riot, though their actions were dismissed by male political leaders. The creation of the Second Spanish Republic led to an environment encouraging active political participation in broader Spanish society, and ultimately served to assist many women in their decision to head to the front, as the Government expanded rights for women, including the right to vote, divorce, go to school and stand for election.

The [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934]], three years into the Republic's history, saw women mobilized on a battlefront where they defended the rights of striking miners. This created paranoia on the right that women would take up arms and dispense with male leadership. Two years later, the [[Spanish Civil War]] started in [[Melilla]] and soon expanded nationwide. Women rose up to defend the Republic, playing a critical role in making the war a protracted affair. The start of the Civil War saw women mobilized in militias affiliated with unions and political organizations, with over 1,000 women joining up in the opening months to serve on the front lines of the Republican side. Unlike men, women actively sought out this choice. [[Communism|Communists]] and [[Anarchism|anarchists]] would make up the bulk of women on the front.  Women also came from abroad to fight in the International Brigades.

On the front, women served alongside men in mostly mixed-gendered battalions, and were transferred around Spain.  Despite a desire for combat, some of those in male leadership positions made them serve in support roles.  Women were killed and injured on the front. The first Spanish Republican woman to die on the battlefield was [[Lina Ódena]] on 13 September 1936.  They were on the front from July 1936 to March 1937, when they were officially demobilized.  This decision was made by male political and military leaders, who were threatened by their presence.  The decision was opposed by the women themselves.

The valuable contributions of Republican women fighters has been under reported, and women's own stories have frequently been ignored.  This was a result of sexism, women fearing torture and death, and lack of primary sources.

While women had been sporadically involved in combat in Spain, no large organized force of female fighters ({{Lang-es|miliciana}})  had been mobilized in the prelude to the Second Republic.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTqE7HEzJKoC|title=Milicianas: Women in Combat in the Spanish Civil War|last=Lines|first=Lisa Margaret|date=2012|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739164921|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":242"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lines|first=Lisa Margaret|date=May 2009|title=Female Combatants in the Spanish Civil War: Milicianas on the Front Lines and in the Rearguard|url=https://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.es/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1265&amp;context=jiws|journal=Journal of International Women's Studies|volume=11|issue=4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":343"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mujeres Libres: Reclaiming their predecessors, their feminisms and the voice of women in the Spanish Civil War history|last=de Ayguavives|first=Mònica|publisher=Central European University, Department of Gender Studies|year=2014|isbn=|location=Budapest, Hungary|pages=|type=Masters Thesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable women who had participated in the past included Napoleon resistance fighter [[Agustina de Aragón]], [[Manuela Malasaña]] and [[Clara del Rey Calvo|Clara del Rey]] during the [[Peninsular War]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; During the Peninsular War, a writer for the ''[[La Gaceta de Madrid]]'' would ask why the city's women fighters exceeded their men in courage.&lt;ref name=":37"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.es/cultura/abci-manuela-malasana-doncella-represento-espana-ultrajada-201812020134_noticia.html|title=Manuela Malasaña, la doncella que representó la España ultrajada|last=|first=|date=2 December 2018|website=[[ABC (Spain)|ABC]]|language=es|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=24 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their status as national icons, these women were the exception to the rule about women's roles in war in this period.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":37" /&gt;

Still, this period would start to set the stage for women's later involvement.  Women continued to be locked out politically, and created auxiliary organizations to male dominated ones in order to be politically engaged in ideologies like socialism and anarchism.  Depending on the level of acceptance from these groups and unions, women moderated their voices accordingly.  As a consequence, when the Civil War came, anarchist women headed to the front lines in greater numbers than socialist women, as their political involvement was greater and more direct.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DT4ds3csyk8C|title=Memories of Resistance: Women's Voices from the Spanish Civil War|last=Mangini|first=Shirley|last2=González|first2=Shirley Mangini|date=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300058161|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923-1930) ==
{{Main|Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera}}
When political activity occurred by women during the [[Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera]], it was often spontaneous.  Despite an increasing presence on the streets, women were often ignored by left-wing male political leaders who purported to support their cause.  Despite this, women were increasingly involved in riots and protests, representing increased political awareness of their need to be more active in social and political spheres to enact change to improve their lives. Their participation politically though did not yet involve taking up arms against or in support of the government.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The abdication of Spain's king in 1930 would spell the end of the dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]], and usher in the era of the Second Republic.&lt;ref name=":83"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2004|title=Los orígenes del sufragismo en España|url=https://www.ucm.es/data/cont/docs/995-2015-01-09-sufragismo.pdf|journal=Espacio, Tiempo y Forma|language=es|location=Madrid|publisher=[[UNED]]|publication-date=January 2015|volume=16|pages=455–482|access-date=25 February 2019|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second Spanish Republic (1931 - 1937) ==
{{Main|Second Spanish Republic}}
The rights women attained under the constitution of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] played a role in encouraging active participation in broader Spanish society, and ultimately served to assist many women in their decision later to head to the front.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Ávila Espada|first=Mar|title=La miliciana en la guerra civil: Realidad e imagen|date=2017|degree=Masters thesis|publisher=Universidad de Sevilla|url=https://idus.us.es/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11441/63244/La%20miliciana%20en%20la%20Guerra%20Civil%2C%20realidad%20e%20imagen%20MAR%20%C3%81VILA%20ESPADA.%20ADRI%C3%81N%20HUICI%20M%C3%93DENES.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|doi=|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rights included in the constitution included universal suffrage, the ability to run for office, employment in government offices without regards to gender during the hiring process, access to unified education across all levels, and divorce.  The first elections in the Second Republic saw three women elected to office, before women had achieved the right to vote.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Second Republic also heralded in a period of the creation of numerous women's political organizations across the political spectrum all around Spain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Committee of Women against War and Fascism ({{Lang-es|Asociación de Mujeres contra la Guerra y el Fascismo}}) was created in 1933, with support from [[Communist Party of Spain|Partido Comunista de España]] (PCE) and [[Dolores Ibárruri]] acting as its major driver.  It soon attracted women from across the political spectrum.  &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Existing tensions within the anarchist movement, as a result of deliberate exclusion or discouragement by male leadership, eventually led to the creation of [[Mujeres Libres]] by [[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]], [[Mercedes Comaposada]] and [[Amparo Poch y Gascón]] in May 1936, shortly before the start of the Civil War.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":343"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uCclDwAAQBAJ|title=Spanish Women Writers and Spain's Civil War|last=Bieder|first=Maryellen|last2=Johnson|first2=Roberta|date=2016-12-01|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781134777167|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LE1kjvjTHmIC|title=Free Women of Spain: Anarchism and the Struggle for the Emancipation of Women|last=Ackelsberg|first=Martha A.|author-link=Martha Ackelsberg|date=2005|publisher=AK Press|isbn=9781902593968|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":252"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hastings|first=Alex|date=|title=Mujeres Libres: Lessons on Anarchism and Feminism from Spain’s Free Women|url=https://cedar.wwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1233&amp;context=scholwk|journal=Scholars Week|publisher=Western Washington University|publication-date=18 March 2016|volume=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304396163_A_Case_Apart_The_Evolution_of_Spanish_Feminism|title=A Case Apart: The Evolution of Spanish Feminism|last=Ryan|first=Lorraine|work=Feminisms within and without|publisher=National Women Studies Centre|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Pelan|editor-first=Rebecca|location=|publication-place=Galway|publication-date=January 2006|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially based in Madrid and Barcelona, the organization had the purpose of seeking emancipation for women.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Their goals also included "to  combat  the  triple  enslavement  to  which  (women)  have  been subject: enslavement to ignorance, enslavement as women and enslavement as workers".&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; Anarchists activity during the Second Republic, including classes on ideology, would be the roots from which many militia women ({{Lang-es|milicianas}}) emerged.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== October Revolution of 1934 ===
{{Main|Asturian miners' strike of 1934}}
[[File:Locator_map_of_Asturias.png|left|thumb|Location of [[Asturias|Asturias, Spain]].]]
Women played roles behind the scenes in one of the first major conflicts of the Second Republic, when workers' militias seized control of the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|mines in Asturias]].&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bgeBBMtgbAYC|title=Prison of Women: Testimonies of War and Resistance in Spain, 1939-1975|last=Cuevas|first=Tomasa|date=1998|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791438572|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":302"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqxxAQsW_KUC|title=Ghosts of Passion: Martyrdom, Gender, and the Origins of the Spanish Civil War|last=Bunk|first=Brian D.|date=2007-03-28|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822339434|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally planned as a nationwide strike, the workers collective action only really took place in Asturias.&lt;ref name=":302"/&gt; Some women were involved in propaganda others in assisting the miners, and some in active combat confrontation. After the government quelled the insurrection by bringing in Moroccan legionaries, some 30,000 people found themselves in prison and another 1,000 were put into graves.  A large number of those put into prison were women. &lt;ref name=":122" /&gt;

During fighting in [[Oviedo]], women were on the battlefield serving in a variety of roles.  At least one attended to the wounded while shelling went on around her. Others took up arms.  Still more went from leftist position to leftist position with active shelling happening, providing fighters with food and motivational speeches.&lt;ref name=":302"/&gt;  [[Aída Lafuente]] was among the Spanish women who took part in militant labor action in October 1934 in Asturias.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The Asturian conflict saw few instances of women initiated violence.  This fed into paranoia among those on the right that women would violently try to seize power from men.  Both on the left and the right, people viewed these women as heroic, and men wanted to limit their potential for further political action.&lt;ref name=":302"/&gt; Women were also involved in building barricades, clothing repair, and street protests.  For many women, this was the first time they were civically engaged without a male chaperone as in many cases these women were working on behalf of imprisoned male relatives.&lt;ref name=":352"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VE4YVw9iBksC|title=Republic of Egos: A Social History of the Spanish Civil War|last=Seidman|first=Michael|date=2002-11-23|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299178635|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were also killed in this conflict. [[Aida Lafuente|Aída Lafuente]] was active on the front, and died during the Asturian conflict.&lt;ref name=":352" /&gt; The actions of women attached to Asociación de Mujeres contra la Guerra y el Fascismo in the event led to the organization being declared illegal later in the year.  To get around this, the women re-organized as [[Organización Pro Infancia Obrera]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

More recently, academics have debated if the Asturian miners' strike represented the real start of the Spanish Civil War.&lt;ref name=":302"/&gt; Imagery from the conflict was subsequently used by both sides for propaganda to further their own agenda, particularly inside PSOE who saw it the situation as a call for political unity on the left if they were to have any hope of countering the rise of fascism in Spain.&lt;ref name=":302"/&gt;  PSOE consequently used a lot of gendered imagery to sell people on their ideas.&lt;ref name=":302"/&gt; Propaganda used featuring the events on October 1934 featured women in gender conforming ways that did not challenge their roles as feminine.  This was done by male leadership with the intention of counteracting the image of strong women political leaders, who unnerved many on the right.  Right wing propaganda at the time featured women as vicious killers, who defied gender norms to eliminate the idea of Spanish motherhood.&lt;ref name=":302"/&gt;

=== Start of the Civil War ===

On 17 July 1936, the [[Unión Militar Española]] launched a [[coup d'état]] in North Africa and Spain.  They believed they would have an easy victory.  They failed to predict the people's attachment to the Second Republic.  With the Republic largely maintaining control over its Navy, Franco and others in the military successfully convinced Adolf Hitler to provide transport for Spanish troops from North Africa to the Iberian peninsula.  These actions led to a divided Spain, and the protracted events of the Spanish Civil War.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":252"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":302"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=naKBAgAAQBAJ|title=British Women and the Spanish Civil War|last=Jackson|first=Angela|date=2003-09-02|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134471065|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/renegadescanadia0000petr|url-access=registration|title=Renegades: Canadians in the Spanish Civil War|last=Petrou|first=Michael|date=2008-03-01|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=9780774858281|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":293"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin Moruno|first=Dolorès|date=2010|title=Becoming visible and real: Images of Republican Women during the Spanish Civil War|url=https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:28796|journal=Visual Culture &amp; Gender|volume=5|pages=5–15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It would not officially end until 1 April 1939.&lt;ref name=":302" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":293" /&gt;

Franco's initial coalition included [[Monarchism|monarchists]], [[Conservative Republican Party (Spain)|conservative Republicans]], [[Falange Española]] members, [[Carlism|Carlist traditionalist]], [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic clergy]] and the [[Spanish Army|Spanish army]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/fearlesswomeninm00linh|url-access=registration|title=Fearless Women in the Mexican Revolution and the Spanish Civil War|last=Linhard|first=Tabea Alexa|date=2005|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=9780826264985|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":212"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PtPelshBWCMC|title=The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939|last=Beevor|first=Antony|date=2012-08-23|publisher=Orion|isbn=9781780224534|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had support from [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name=":293" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt; The Republican side included [[Socialism|Socialists]], [[Communism|Communists]], and various other left wing actors.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":293" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;

The military revolt was announced on the radio across the country, and people took to the streets immediately as they tried to determine the extent of the situation, and if it was a military or political conflict. [[Dolores Ibárruri]] would soon coin the phrase "[[They shall not pass|¡No pasarán!]]"  a few days later, on 18 July 1936 in [[Madrid]] while on the radio from the Ministry of the Interior's radio station, saying, "It is better to die on your feet than live on your knees. ¡[[They shall not pass|No pasarán]]!"&lt;ref name=":362"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j983FGkF1jEC|title=Autobiography of La Pasionaria|last=Ibárruri|first=Dolores|date=1966|publisher=International Publishers Co|isbn=9780717804689|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the Civil War, there were two primary anarchist organizations: [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) and the [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]] (FAI).  Representing working-class people, they set out to prevent the Nationalists from seizing control while also serving as reforming influences inside Spain.&lt;ref name=":252" /&gt;

Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union signed the Non-Intervention Treaty in August 1936, promising not to provide material support for the war to any of the parties, even as Germany and Italy were already and continued to provide support to the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist faction]].&lt;ref name=":343"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":362" /&gt;

== Spanish Civil War (1936 - 1939) ==
{{Main|Spanish Civil War}}

==== Background ====
Because of changes in society, women who wanted to be involved in the war against the Rebel forces had two options: they could fight on the front lines or they could serve in auxiliary roles away from the front.  Their options were not limited, like that of many women near the battlefields of [[World War I]], where the only available role was that of auxiliary role to support men on the front.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-jBpAAAAMAAJ|title=Defying male civilization: women in the Spanish Civil War|last=Nash|first=Mary|date=1995|publisher=Arden Press|isbn=9780912869155|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asociación de Mujeres contra la Guerra y el Fascismo]] underwent a second name change in 1936, shortly after the start of the Civil War.  Their new name was [[Agrupación de Mujeres Antifascistas]].  From there, the group would play a prominent role in sending and supporting women on the front lines in the war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  At the same time that the new Agrupación de Mujeres Antifascistas was readying for war, many women's organizations on both the right and the left were shutting down.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Mobilization ====
The Spanish Civil War started on 17 July 1936 with a coup d'état.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rEMrDwAAQBAJ|title="Visual Propaganda, Exhibitions, and the Spanish Civil War "|last=Basilio|first=Miriam M.|date=2017-07-05|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351537438|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military revolt that started the civil war did not immediately succeed in part because of women who took part in spontaneous uprisings.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; 
[[File:Spain_Madrid.png|left|thumb|Location of Madrid, Spain's capital city, where many women were mobilized to [[Siege of Madrid|defend the home front]].]]
One of the most important mass mobilizations of women in Spain's history was their participation on the anti-Nationalist front.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Shortly after the start of the Civil War, around 1,000 Spanish women volunteered to serve on the front lines of the Republican side.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PtPelshBWCMC|title=The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939|last=Beevor|first=Antony|date=2012-08-23|publisher=Orion|isbn=9781780224534|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the cities that saw the greatest number of armed women rise to its defense was Madrid.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;  This quick mobilization of women was part of the reason that the Nationalists did not gain a quick victory, and the war became a more protracted affair.&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q0laDwAAQBAJ|title=Revolution and the State: Anarchism in the Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939|last=Evans|first=Danny|date=2018-05-08|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351664738|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the militias that were created during the immediate outbreak of the Civil War came from civil society groups like trade unions and political parties.  CNT, UGT and other unions stepped in to provide logistical support for many of these militias.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The number of women mobilized was never high.  Most joined in order to further support political ideologies they supported.  Most came from militant libertarian organizations like  CNT, FAI and FIJL.  These militias often lacked the typical military structure in order to better represent their ideologies and better mobilize local populations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Women were not actively recruited to serve in militias.  Rather, they actively sought out places to enlist. Unlike men, women had the choice to fight and made that choice.  Their efforts were often difficult, as many militias rejected them on basis of their gender, and they were constantly asked to prove themselves more than men on front.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other women called them to the front, including [[Dolores Ibárruri]].  In the last days of Republican control of Madrid, she implored both men and women to take to arms against Nationalist forces in the city.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lyZYS_GxglIC|title=Women and War: A Historical Encyclopedia from Antiquity to the Present|last=Cook|first=Bernard A.|date=2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781851097708|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers of women mobilized and armed behind the front in support of cities exceeded the numbers who were on the front line.  At most, probably 1,000 women fought on the front lines, while several thousand served in city defense.  The latter included a women's only battalion that served in Madrid.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

Communists and anarchists columns attracted the most women among all the political groups on the Republican front. POUM attracted women fighters, but in smaller numbers.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt; Partido Socialista Obrero Español (PSOE) was one of the only major actors on the left to immediately reject the idea of women participating in combat.  The idea was too radical for them, and they believed women should serve as heroes at home, providing support to civilian populations well behind the front lines.  Women who were members of PSOE who found their way to combat did so by joining communist and socialist youth groups.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;

Women also came from abroad to fight as part of the [[International Brigades]], with their total numbers documented at between 400 and 700 women.  Many women first traveled to Paris, before going by boat or train to fight.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They came from countries like the [[United States]], [[Poland]], [[France]], [[Russia]], [[Switzerland]], [[England]], [[Norway]] and [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7weGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Emmy+D%C3%B6rfel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fefKMs0Gjz&amp;sig=ACfU3U37WS_d6CA32FAGkshlwHNqKkoo-g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjNm-HOoofgAhUyrVkKHdY4AUwQ6AEwBXoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Emmy%20D%C3%B6rfel&amp;f=false|title=Nursing History and the Politics of Welfare|last=Rafferty|first=Ann Marie|last2=Robinson|first2=Jane|date=2005-08-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134773541|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Alba, Víctor &amp; Stephen Schwartz, ''Spanish Marxism vs Soviet Communism: A History of the P.O.U.M'', Transaction Publishers, 1988, {{ISBN|0-88738-198-7}} p.124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Pauline|date=February 2014|title=Felicia Browne: first British casualty in Spain|url=|journal=International Journal Memorial Trust Newsletter|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levin 1986"&gt;Levin, Immanuil (1986).

The first Spanish Republican women to die on the battlefield was Almeria born JSU affiliated ''miliciana''  [[Lina Ódena]] on 13 September 1936.  With Nationalist forces overrunning her position, the unit commander chose to commit suicide rather than to surrender at a battle in [[Guadix]].&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_DkhAwAAQBAJ|title=The Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939|last=Alpert|first=Michael|date=2013-02-28|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107328570|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her death would be widely shared by both Republican and Falangist propagandists.  With Nationalist forces threatening her with the potential of being raped by Moorish soldiers if she is does not surrender, Republicans were able to cast her as an innocent who chose death rather than to be debased and lose her honor. Falangist propaganda said there was never there and there was never a threat of rape.  This made Ódena's death meaningless.  Beyond that, Falangist propaganda implied Ódena had been guilty of murdering a Catholic priest a few weeks prior, with her suicide was a way of escaping punishment.&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;

==== On the front ====
[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_146-1968-048-15,_Spanischer_Bürgerkrieg.jpg|thumb|Milicianas with their weapons during the Spanish Civil War.]]
On the front, the norm was for women to serve in mixed gender battalion units.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt; They were transferred around Spain, depending on military needs for troop reinforcements.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt; Rearguard ''miliciana'' groups were more likely to be organized into women only battalions, and were more likely to be based in the same location as part of defensive units.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt; As a consequence, the roles played by each tended to be different.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;

Women on the front often were faced with a duel burden of being expected to fight and to provide auxiliary support.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt; Male leadership decisions to require this reinforced sexism inside the Republic, by allowing women to break free of gender norms by serving in combat but at the same time forcing them to engage in traditionally gendered tasks.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;  Despite this, they were recognized by their peers for their bravery.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://descubrirlahistoria.es/2015/09/las-milicianas-de-la-guerra-civil-espanola/|title=Las milicianas de la guerra civil española|last=Franco|first=Álvaro López|date=10 September 2015|website=Descubrir la Historia|language=es|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=27 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most women on the front served in militias aligned with some political group.  A very small number served as members of the regular Republican army.  Members included [[Esperanza Rodríguez]].&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt; In the first few months of the war, the Fifth Regiment had the largest contingent of ''milicianas'' among all militias.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most of the women serving in front line roles had their positions defined by the communist, anarchist or POUM leadership.  Most of these gave women equal roles when it came to combat, and providing the same military contribution.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt; In comparison to men, women on the front were often more expected to take care of injured comrades. This sometimes put them in more harms way, as some women militia members were shot while tending to injured comrades in battle. Women who had to deal with this situation included  [[Josefa Rionda]]. Captains might also divert women on the battlefield to hospitals, where they expected them to work alongside nurses.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt; In some cases, ''milicianas'' were told by column leaders that they were only allowed to remain on the front in support roles for men, by doing working as nurses or teaching largely illiterate militiamen to read.  A number of these women left those columns, seeking other units where they could serve in combat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Among the women serving in the international brigades, most worked as nurses, pharmacists or doctors.  Some Jewish, Polish and American women did go to Spain, and did serve in combat.  They were actively discouraged from doing so by anarchists, and outright banned from doing so by communists.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BahyDgAAQBAJ|title=Jewish Volunteers, the International Brigades and the Spanish Civil War|last=Zaagsma|first=Gerben|date=2017-04-06|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781472513793|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combat experience did not significantly differ based on the political affiliation of the battalion that women in combat were attached to.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt; Women proved versatile on the front, able to serve in many different combat roles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Women in rearguard battalions often met daily to practice weapons training, marching and drilling.  Many also received specialized training in the use of machine guns.  &lt;ref name=":242" /&gt; POUM was the only organization that had accepted women and provided them with weapons training.  The lack of weapons training by women in other militias would later be used as a reason to try to remove them from the front, even as those militias also failed to prove their male recruits with weapons training.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Milicianas'' also came from all over Spain, including Madrid, Majorca, Catalonia and Asturias.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  One ''miliciana'' served as captain of the artillery company of the Second Asturias Battalion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:RepublicanWoman1936GTaro.jpg|thumb|An armed Republican ''miliciana'' in 1936 in a photo by [[Gerda Taro]].]]

These women also came from across the leftist political spectrum.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One of the few publicly socialist identified militia women in this period was [[María Elisa García]], who served as a ''miliciana'' with the Popular Militias as a member Asturias Battalion Somoza company.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;

Women were injured on the front.  [[Julia Manzanal]] was a ''miliciana'' who found herself pregnant on the front as a result of her relationship with her boyfriend.  She found a midwife, had an abortion in the morning and was back to fighting on the front in afternoon.  As a consequence of the abortion, she bled for over a month while in combat.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; While on the front, [[Rosario Sánchez Mora|Rosario Sánchez]] had an accident involving an explosive made from a condensed milk jug that led to the amputation of her hand.  She almost bled out as a consequence of her wounds, but survived only to later be captured and sent to prison. [[Steel Battalion (Spanish Civil War)|Steel Battalion]] [[Jacinta Pérez]] was mortally wounded by urged her comrades ahead towards the enemy they were facing.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Women in the [[Pasionaria Column]] of the [[Fifth Regiment]] of the [[Popular Militia]]s often tried to transfer out.  This was in part because column leaders often tried to keep women out of combat, and instead have them work in support roles for the column that included cook, and cleaning clothes and dishes.  Captains in the Column often tried to force women assigned to the Column out.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;

Some women in the ''milicianas'' cut their hair in case of capture.  They did not want their heads shaved except for tufts that would then have Nationalist ribbons put in them and then being paraded around a town near where they were captured.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt; Nationalists would frequently execute prisoners of war that had been transported to prison.  This included executing pregnant ''milicianas'' captured in combat.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt; The threat of rape of female combatants was one used regularly by Nationalist forces to discourage their involvement.&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRnhAQAAQBAJ|title=Memory and Cultural History of the Spanish Civil War: Realms of Oblivion|date=2013-10-04|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004259966|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a very real threat as it happened as a regular feature for both combatant and non-combatant women, with Moorish soldiers being used in some cases to further the debasement of these women soldiers among their battalions and in the wider population.&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;  It also served Nationalist forces to remind all women that they were inferior to men, and that men would easily conquer them.&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;  Consequently, when women died on the front, their deaths were often treated not as deaths towards a higher purpose, but a personal loss of honor resulting in death.&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Female fighters caught on the front and given death sentences were often raped before being shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780521459327|url-access=registration|title=The Spanish Republic at War 1936-1939|last=Graham|first=Helen|date=2002-12-19|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521459327|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franco's treatment of Republican women fighters caught on the front line at times shocked his German allies.  He could and did order their execution, and then return to eating breakfast as if nothing special had occurred.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

In the last half of 1936, ''milicianas'' were not considered exceptional by many of their male colleagues; they served as comrades alongside men in separate or mixed gender battalions.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  This was in large part because many of the ''milicianas'' were motivated to fight because their own revolutionary beliefs: they believed their involvement could change the course of the war, and bring about a new revolution in thinking in society.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; A few women fought because they were following husbands, fathers or sons into battle.  This group though represented a very small minority, with the majority fighting for ideological reasons.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Because women were viewed by some as unnatural participants in battle, women were often suspected of espionage or seeking to betray Republican ideals.  They began to become suspect on the battlefield. This paranoia would later play a role in removing women from the front.&lt;ref name=":352" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  ''Milicianas'' were also suspected of passing along sexually transmitted diseases to men, which resulted in male fighters dying from syphilis.  This was perceived as viewing bringing militias into disrepute and harming male readiness for combat.&lt;ref name=":343"/&gt; Military and political leaders also slandered ''milicianas'', accusing them of being prostitutes and nymphomaniacs, representing a greater threat to the loyalist forces than the rebel forces they were facing in battle because they spread venereal disease.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Mika Etchebérhère in ''Ma guerre d'Espagne à moi'' published in Paris in 1976 contends that some women were straight up prostitutes, encouraged to the front by the presence of single men who had money.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;María de la Luz Mejías Correa in ''Así fue pasando el tiempo. Memorias de una miliciana extremeña'' published in 2006 in Seville said that despite going to the front to accompany her husband, local women in the area still called her (incorrectly) a prostitute and a slut. These local women also accused milicianas of spreading venereal disease.  While there were some brothels near the front, they were not run by milicianas and de la Luz Mejías Correa contends that men who went to brothels were never accused of spreading venereal disease.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clara Campoamor]] would be among a number of voices urging women off the front, accusing women of being prostitutes. When this was shared among ''milicianas'', it made some of their blood boil, as it demonstrated to them that the left was no better than the right when it came to protecting women's rights.  Such rationales, along with lack of weapons training, were used to make an argument that women should be removed from the front.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Lina Ódena]], [[Soledad Casilda Méndez]], [[Aída Lafuente]], [[Rosario Sánchez Mora]], [[Concha Lozano]] and [[Maruja Tomico]] were all ''milicianas'' who would be immortalized by the Republic during this period of active women's involvement in combat.&lt;ref name=":40"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://losojosdehipatia.com.es/cultura/historia/usar-y-tirar-las-mujeres-republicanas-en-la-propaganda-de-guerra/|title=Usar y tirar: las mujeres republicanas en la propaganda de guerra|last=González Naranjo|first=Rocío|date=1 March 2017|website=Los ojos de Hipatia|language=es-ES|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=26 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== July 1936 =====
====== Aragon Front ======
The Catalans had their own militia in Aragon, with a small contingent of elite women fighters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The [[Los Aguiluchos de Les Corts]] group moved from Barcelona to [[Caspe]] on the [[Aragon front]], following their involvement in conflicts in Barcelona.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt; [[Concha Pérez Collado]] joined the [[Ortiz column]] while in Caspe, going with her new unit to [[Azaila]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; [[Soledad Casilda Méndez]] served in a militia from the Basque Country, where she was the only woman initially.  Involved at the fighting during the last days on the Aragon front, she was one of only two women involved in active combat with her militia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====== Barcelona Front ======
[[Unión de Muchachas]] battalion included two thousand women aged fourteen to twenty-five.  They started training in July 1936, when the Civil War began.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alba-valb.org/resources/lessons/the-spanish-civil-war-poster/introduction/UniondeMuchachas.jpg/view?searchterm=poster|title=Spanish Civil War History and Education: Unión de Muchachas|last=|first=|date=|website=Abraham Lincoln Brigade|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=27 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were sponsored by the National Confederation for Physical Education, and came from a group of leftist sportspeople who had protested Hitler organizing the 1936 Summer Olympics, and who had organized the [[People's Olympiad|People's Olympics]] in Barcelona that year in protest. The start of the war led to the cancellation of the event, with a number of the participants enlisting in support of the Republic and being involved in the July 1936 defense of Barcelona.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This included English woman [[Felicia Browne]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Upon enlisting, she was quoted as saying, "I am a member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|London Communists]] and I can fight as well as any man".&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Impact of the Spanish Civil War on Britain|last=Buchanan|first=Tom|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-84519-127-6|location=Eastbourne|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Switzerland's [[Clara Thalmann]] was another woman who joined a Republican militia after the cancellation of the Games, volunteering in the [[Durruti Column]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;[[Concha Pérez Collado]] was part of [[Los Aguiluchos de Les Corts]], a group of 100 armed soldiers from her Barcelona neighborhood, who joined shortly after the outbreak of the war. Only seven members of the group were women.&lt;ref name=":110"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elperiodico.com/es/sociedad/20140417/muere-concha-perez-una-ultimas-milicianas-cnt-guerra-civil-3252702|title=Muere Concha Pérez, una de las últimas milicianas de la CNT en la guerra civil|last=Barcelona|first=EFE /|date=14 April 2014|website=elperiodico|language=es|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=19 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after the start of the Civil War, Pérez Collado was part of a group that attacked the [[Model Prison]] with a goal of freeing political prisoners housed inside. Later, she was part of a group that took control of a convent.&amp;nbsp; She also assisted in creating barricades in her Barcelona neighborhood.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt; Along with other anarchists, she rode in the back of a pickup truck covered by a mattress and with four guns between them.&amp;nbsp; They went to the [[Pedralbes Barracks]], engaged in fighting there and managed to gain a small cache of weapons.&amp;nbsp; Following this, her group went to [[Caspe]] on the [[Aragon front]].&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;

[[Marina Ginestà|Marina Ginestà i Coloma]] was another woman on the front in Madrid in July 1937.  Originally from France and a member of the Unified Socialist Youth, she joined the war as a reporter when she was only 17 years old. Ginestà i Coloma, working with [[Mikhail Koltsov]], served as a photographer and translator for the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] newspaper ''[[Pravda]]''. A famous photograph of her at the original Hotel Colón was taken on 21 July 1936. A non-combatant, it was the only time during the war when she handled a weapon.&lt;ref name="rtve2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publico.es/493189/muere-marina-ginesta-la-sonrisa-que-planto-cara-al-fascismo|title=Muere Marina Ginestà, la sonrisa que plantó cara al fascismo|date=6 January 2014|publisher=Público|language=Spanish|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lois Orr]] served in Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) female militia in Barcelona in the early part of the war.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Lois Orr, ''Letters from Barcelona: An American Woman in Revolution and Civil War'', edited by Gerd-Rainer Horn, {{ISBN|978-0-230-52739-3}}, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;Jeremy Harding, ''Paralysed by the Absence of Danger'', London Review of Books, 31(18), 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Siege of Cuartel de la Montaña ======

[[File:Enlisting in the Spanish Civil War.jpg|thumb|Volunteered of Milicias Populares at Cuartel General "Fernando Condés" during the first days of the war.]]
Women's only battalions existed behind the front lines as rearguard support in defense of their cities.  Barcelona had such a battalion organized by PSUC. In Mallorca, there was the [[Rosa Luxemburg Battalion]] , and in Madrid there was the [[Unión de Muchachas]].&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt; In the first days of the war, [[Trinidad Revoltó Cervelló]] was involved in front line combat at the Military Headquarters and at the [[Atarazanas Barracks]] in Barcelona.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt; [[Pepita Laguarda Batet]] was also among the women who were involved in July confrontations.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://libcom.org/history/laguarda-batet-pepita-1919-1936|title=Laguarda Batet, Pepita (1919-1936)|author=Heath, Nick|publisher=libcom.org|language=|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cardona1986"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6N8pAQAAMAAJ|title=La batalla de Madrid|author=Gabriel Cardona|publisher=Historia 16|year=1986|isbn=978-84-85229-96-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were involved in the [[Montaña Barracks attack]].  [[Angelina Martínez]] was among them.  Originally from Madrid, she was a member of [[Unified Socialist Youth|Juventudes Socialistas Unificadas]].  She continued fighting even after most of the men in her unit were killed.  Her actions were featured later that month in the newspaper ''[[Estampa]]''.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5a6hDgAAQBAJ|title=Traveler, There Is No Road: Theatre, the Spanish Civil War, and the Decolonial Imagination in the Americas|last=Jackson-Schebetta|first=Lisa|date=2017-06-15|publisher=University of Iowa Press|isbn=9781609384906|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Madrid Front ======
POUM initially required both men and women in combat to also engage in support roles as needed.  Women were in the trenches and stood guard.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt; Captain [[Fernando Saavedra (military officer)|Fernando Saavedra]] of the [[Sargento Vázquez Battalion]] said these women fought just like men.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;

[[Fidela Fernández de Velasco Pérez]] had been trained in the use of arms before the start of the war, and served on the front lines right away outside Madrid.  She captured a cannon from the Nationalists, before being transferred to the Toledo front.  Her new unit was the same one which [[Rosario Sánchez de la Mora]] was serving.   There, Fernández de Velasco Pérez fought on the front and sought action by going behind enemy lines to sabotage them alongside other shock troops. She learned how to construct bombs.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;

[[Rosario Sánchez Mora]] was one of the first women to join the militias in defense of Madrid following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, enlisting as a 17-year-old on 17 July 1936.&lt;ref name="ti"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/rosario-sanchez-frontline-fighter-against-franco-813357.html|title=Rosario Sanchez: Front-line fighter against Franco|last=Nash|first=Elizabeth|date=2008-04-22|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2008-05-13|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Teófila Madroñal]] was another Spanish woman who served on the front lines.  She enlisted in [[Leningrad Battalion]] during the first days of the war, underwent weapons training and then was deployed to the [[Autovía A-5|Estremadura highway]] during the [[Siege of Madrid]].&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;

When the war broke out, [[Margarita Ribalta]] was initially assigned by JSU to a position at headquarters.  Unhappy with not being more involved, a few days later she enrolled with a [[Communist Party of Spain|Partido Comunista de España]] column and was transferred to the front, where she volunteered to be part of an advance group trying to take a hill.  She led her group, running between two Nationalist positions while carrying a machine gun.  A Republican support plane mistook her group for Nationalists, bombing them and wounding Ribalta.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;

Argentine born [[Mika Feldman de Etchebéhère|Mika Etchebéhère]] served in a POUM militia during the Civil War.  A self-described Trotskyist, Etchebéhère moved to Madrid from Paris a few days before the outbreak of the War, enlisting immediately and then being deployed as part of the [[Hipólito Etchebéhère column]] to the front near Madrid.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ANwzDwAAQBAJ|title=Spanish Marxism versus Soviet Communism: A History of the P.O.U.M. in the Spanish Civil War|last=Alba|first=Victor|date=2017-09-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351488556|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Siege of Sigüenza ======
Women militants and civilians were part of the group that found themselves trapped for four days at the [[Sigüenza Cathedral]] as a result of a Nationalist siege in October 1936.  After running out of food and ammo, with the walls of the Cathedral beginning to fall from incessant cannon fire, many in the group decided to make a run for it at night. POUM Captain [[Mika Feldman de Etchebéhère]] was among those at the Cathedral.  She was one of the approximately one third of people who fled who survived.  Her bravery during the Siege of Sigüenza earned her a promotion to POUM's [[Lenin Battalion]]  Second Company Captain. After recovering from the siege in Barcelona, she was ordered to [[Moncloa-Aravaca|Moncloa]], where she was in charge of a special shock troop brigade.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

===== November 1936 =====

====== Siege of Madrid ======
{{Main|Siege of Madrid}}
While most battalions were mixed gendered, the Women's Battalion organized by the PCE and saw combat on the Madrid front was only women.  The battalion was called  [[Batallón Femenino del 5º Regimiento de Milicias Populares]].  Some women who were already serving as nurses as part of the Fifth Regiment returned from the front specifically to join the women's only battalion. Battalion members would sometimes march down Gran Vía in Madrid in groups of two or three since shelling on the street was too heavy to allow them to march in formation.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;

Communist women were able to achieve front line leadership roles.  22-year-old [[Aurora Arnáiz]] commanded a JSU column during the Siege of Madrid.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt; [[Julia Manzanal]] became the [[Political commissar|Political Commissar]] for the [[Batallón Municipal de Madrid]] when she was only 17. From there, she armed herself with a rifle and a pistol, fighting on the front lines, serving as a guard and engaging in espionage role despite having enlisted initially with the role of educating her comrades in Communist ideology.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;

By this time, Unión de Muchachas was a communist organized rearguard women's only battalion in Madrid that fought on the front line starting on 8 November 1936. Positioned at Segovia Bridge and  near [[Getafe]] on the [[Carabanchel]] front and representing the bulk of the Republican forces in those positions, Unión de Muchachas fighters were among the last to retreat.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;

====== Republican Army Peñarroya and Córdoba Attacks ======
Foreign observers covering the war often wrote about women's bravery on the front, including saying they took enemy fire better than many of the men they fought alongside.  One example of such bravery happened in [[Córdoba, Spain|Cerro Muriano]] in September 1937, where Republican army forces from Jaén and Valencia fled the front while the small militia force from Alcoy, which included two women, withstood a Nationalist bombardment.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;

==== Demobilization ====
There are conflicting accounts by historians as to when the decision was made to remove women from the front on the Republican side.  One side dates the decision to late fall of 1936 as the date when Prime Minister Francisco Largo Caballero gave the order.  Others date the order to March 1937.  What is most likely is that various political and military leaders made their own decisions based on their own beliefs that led to different groups of female combatants gradually being withdrawn from the front.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":343"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dOw-0DAUajsC|title=Blood Of Spain: An Oral History of the Spanish Civil War|last=Fraser|first=Ronald|date=2012-06-30|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781448138180|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; But whatever date ascribed, women were being encouraged to leave the front by September 1936.&lt;ref name=":343"/&gt;   
[[File:Guadalajara.png|thumb|Location of [[Guadalajara, Castilla–La Mancha|Guadalajara]], where women were told to leave the front in March 1937.|alt=]]
Women were told to leave the front in [[Guadalajara, Castilla–La Mancha|Guadalajara]] in March 1937.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  Following the battle, many were load into cars and taken to support positions further behind the lines.  A few refused to leave, and their fate is uncertain though friends suspected most died in combat.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Expelled soldiers included [[Leopoldine Kokes]] of the International Group of the Durruti Column.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt; Some demobilized women left the front, and joined women's columns on the home front, in defense of cities like Madrid and Barcelona.&lt;ref name=":343"/&gt; When Juan Negrín became the head of the Republican armed forces in May 1937, women's time in combat ended as he continued efforts to regularize Republican forces into the Republican Army.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":40" /&gt; Negrín also sent word out abroad that while men were still being actively recruited, organizations were banned from sending women fighters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Feminists in PSUC and POUM responded by changing their messaging, either suggesting women should be deployed on the home front or that women had a different role to play than men during times of war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The decision to remove ''milicianas'' from the front was one made largely by liberal male Republican leaders.  Women on the front did not agree.  They saw their removal as a backward step, a return to traditional roles that pre-dated the Second Republic.  They viewed this decision as part of a larger symptom of problems for women in society, and did not want to return to the traditional gender roles from which they had used the war to escape.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Neither ''milicianas'' themselves, nor the men they served with or other actors on the Republican side, launched a protest to their withdraw.&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The lack of support from male comrades was particularly upsetting for some women as it appeared to them as if they never bothered to try to understand their plight.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Consequently, the ''milicianas''  just quietly faded away without public protest or awareness.&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt;

The removal of women from the front was a continuation of Second Republic policies designed to appeal to conservatives elements within it, who wanted to make the Republic more palatable by less overtly challenging traditional Spanish beliefs about topics such as the role of women.  Removing women from the front was just part of a broader late Republican role back of women's rights to appease this base that had actually served to encourage Nationalist forces and ideas in the first place, with rationals like women did not know how to use weapons and women spread venereal disease.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==== Media depictions ====
[[File:Milicianas_em_1936_por_Gerda_Taro.jpg|thumb|Republican militia women in training during the Spanish Civil War.]]
Republican propaganda about women fell into several broad categories including as a symbol of the struggle, as protective women like nurses, as victims, as representatives of the Republic, as protectors of Spain's rearguard, as carriers of venereal disease, and as combatants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":40" /&gt;

During the Spanish Civil War, the [[Miliciana|militia woman]] ({{Lang-es|miliciana}}) served as an important figure for Republican forces in the period between July and December 1936.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":293" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;

Both foreign and domestic media printed images of these female fighters on Spain's front lines as breaking gender norms.  Initially, they presented problems for some people in Spain, as the country had very traditional ideas about gender roles.  While Republicans became more accepting of them, this started to change yet again by December 1936 when the Government of the Second Republic started using the slogan, "Men to the Front, Women to the Home Front." By March 1937, this attitude had spread to the front lines, where militia women, over their own objections, were withdrawn or placed into secondary roles.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt;

Republican forces used the presence of ''milicianas'' as adventurous and sometimes frivolous in their own propaganda.  Nationalist propaganda in contract often depicted the ''miliciana'' as a prostitute.  To some degree, the image in Republican propaganda was one that many ''milicianas'' identified with and were complicit in sharing as they had absorbed cultural gender norms in their youth that they continued to perpetuate.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":293" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt; At the same time, they often created and shared narratives that highlighted their chastity during the Civil War.  When interviewed by the press, many women were offended by questions about their private lives.  [[Rosario Sánchez Mora]], ''La Dinamitera'', reacted in anger when interviewed, saying that comparisons to prostitutes hurt her as these women were ready to die for their ideals and ready to die for those who shared in their leftist ideology.&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt; Independent Republican media often depicted ''milicianas'' not in combat, but in support roles.  Many fighters were shown in photos while nursing injured in their battalions, or cooking and cleaning for them.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;

In contrast to the Republican ''miliciana'', Nationalist propaganda held help the image of the ''mujer castiza''.  She was modest, pure, asexual, self-sacrificing and traditional, supporting the Spanish family through work at home,  She was the anti-thesis of the Republican fighter in that she was far away from the front and would never be involved in combat.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e4qtAwAAQBAJ|title=Fighting For Franco: International Volunteers in Nationalist Spain During the Spanish Civil War|last=Keene|first=Judith|date=2007-04-10|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781852855932|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Milicianas'' on the front often wrote about their experiences for publication in party supported media.  One of the main topics they focused on was often inequality on the front, and the expectation that in addition to combat, they would also do support roles like tending to the injured, cooking and cleaning while male colleagues were afforded time to rest.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;

Following their removal from the front, ''milicianas'' and women in general stopped featuring in Republican propaganda.  Visually, they returned to their lives before the war, where their primary role was behind the scenes at home.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Communists and anarchists columns attracted the most women among all the political groups on the Republican front.  Stories about POUM militants became more well known as they were more likely to have published their memories or had better contacts with international media.&lt;ref name=":242" /&gt;

In the end, ''milicianas'' featured in propaganda published by both sides during the Civil War often served as a symbol of a gendered cultural ideal.&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;  Their depictions were often for the male gaze on both sides of the propaganda war.&lt;ref name=":293" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;  The way there were often drawn as highly sexualized beings made it easy for those on both sides to dismiss them as prostitutes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;

== Francoist Spain (1938 - 1973) ==
{{Main|Francoist Spain}}
The end of the Civil War, and the victory of [[Francoist Spain]], saw the return of traditional gender roles to Spain.  This included the unacceptability of women serving in combat roles in the military.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  After the war, many ''milicianas'' faced difficulties.  This included the general population being subjected to a propaganda war that ridiculed their involvement in the conflict.  At the same time, the new government sought them out to put them in prison or torture them.  Many fighters were also illiterate, and found this to be restrict later activities.  This was coupled with restrictions placed on some when in exile in France that limited their opportunities.  For those who remained politically active, they had to deal with open sexism in the Communist Party and in anarchist circles.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Some women's veterans of the war never retired.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt;  They instead continued active violence against the state as part of communist and anarchist cells, using terrorism like tactics.  This included bombing Guardia Civil positions, robbing banks and attacking offices of Falange.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; Women involved with this resistance effort included [[Victoria Pujolar]], [[Adelaida Abarca]] and [[Angelita Ramis]].  These women, and women like them, served as go betweens for exiled leaders in France and those on the ground in Spain.  They worked with Communist Party leaders to plan attacks.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt;

The valuable contributions by Spanish women fighting on the Republican side have been under reported, and women's own stories have frequently been ignored. One of the major reasons for this was the sexism that existed at the time: Women and the problems of women were just not considered important, especially by Francoist victors.  When women's involvement in the Civil War was discussed, it was treated as a bunch of stories not relative to the overarching narratives of the war.  At the same time, because Nationalist forces won the war, they wrote the history that followed,  As they represented a return to traditional gender norms, they had even less reason than Republican forces to discuss the importance of women's involvement on the losing side of the war.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":293" /&gt;

Francoist propaganda actively targeted ''milicianas'', ridiculing their involvement in the war.  Many ''milicianas'' were imprisoned or tortured, even decades after the war ended. As a result, many of the women who fought during the war were forced to remain silent.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The first time Spain's ''milicianas'' were discussed openly was in 1989 at a conference about the Civil War in Salamanca.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Another reason the role of Spanish women on the Republican side in the Civil War has been ignored is there is a lack of primary sources.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This was a result oftentimes of either fleeing government forces destroying documents or women themselves destroying documents in order to protest themselves.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  Concealing their own involvement in the war in many cases assisted them in saving their own lives.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gf82BAAAQBAJ|title=Hell and Good Company: The Spanish Civil War and the World it Made|last=Rhodes|first=Richard|date=2015-02-03|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781451696233|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases, battles themselves resulted in the destruction of valuable documents that discussed women's involvement on the front.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;
