'''''Gods of Egypt''''' is a 2016 [[fantasy film|fantasy]] [[action film]] directed by [[Alex Proyas]] based on the [[ancient Egyptian deities]]. It stars [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]], [[Gerard Butler]], [[Brenton Thwaites]], [[Chadwick Boseman]], [[Élodie Yung]], [[Courtney Eaton]], [[Rufus Sewell]] and [[Geoffrey Rush]]. The film portrays a mortal Egyptian hero who partners with the Egyptian god [[Horus]] to save the world from [[Set (mythology)|Set]] and rescue his love.&lt;ref name="story"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.godsofegypt.movie/story | title=Gods of Egypt &amp;#124; Official Movie Site &amp;#124; Story | work=godsofegypt.movie | publisher=[[Lionsgate]] | accessdate=February 19, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203022231/http://www.godsofegypt.movie/story | archive-date=December 3, 2015 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming took place in Australia under the American film production and distribution company [[Summit Entertainment]]. While the film's production budget was {{nowrap|$140 million,}} the parent company [[Lionsgate]]'s financial exposure was less than $10 million due to tax incentives and pre-sales. The Australian government provided a tax credit for 46% of the film's budget. When Lionsgate began promoting the film in November 2015, it received backlash for its predominantly [[Whitewashing in film|white cast playing Egyptian deities]]. In response, Lionsgate and director Proyas apologized for ethnically inaccurate casting.

Lionsgate released ''Gods of Egypt'' in theaters globally, starting on {{nowrap|February 25}}, 2016, in 2D, [[RealD 3D]], and [[IMAX|IMAX 3D]], and in the United States, Canada, and 68 other markets on {{nowrap|February 26}}. It grossed a total of $150 million against a $140 million budget, becoming a [[box office bomb]] and losing the studio up to $90 million. It received five nominations at the [[37th Golden Raspberry Awards]].

==Plot==
In ancient Egypt, the ruling [[ancient Egyptian deities|god]] [[Osiris]] is killed by his jealous brother [[Set (mythology)|Set]] during the coronation of Osiris's son [[Horus]]. Set seizes the throne and declares that mankind must pay riches to pass into the afterlife. Stripped of his eyes, Horus is exiled as Egypt is driven to its knees.

One year later, a thief named Bek is given the plans for Set's pyramid by his lover Zaya, a slave to chief architect Urshu. Bek steals one of Horus' eyes from Set’s treasure vault, but is caught by Urshu. Zaya is killed, and Bek takes her body to Horus and gives him the eye, promising to find the other if he brings Zaya back from the dead.

They visit the [[Solar deity#Solar barge and sun chariot|divine vessel]] of Horus' grandfather [[Ra]]. Neutral about the conflict with Set, and at war with the shadow beast [[Apep|Apophis]] that threatens to devour the world, Ra does not restore Horus’ power, but gives him a vial of divine waters to weaken Set. Ra explains that Horus’ loss of his powers is the result of not fulfilling his destiny, which Horus believes means avenging his parents' deaths.

Set asks [[Hathor]] to take him to the underworld, but she refuses and escapes. After an attack by [[Minotaur]]s led by [[Mnevis]], followed by other minions and giant cobras, Hathor rescues Horus and Bek. Horus is mistrustful of Hathor, who claims Set is also her enemy. Bek and Horus explain their plan to infiltrate Set's pyramid, and Set warns of a guardian [[Sphinx#Egyptian sphinxes|sphinx]]. They visit the library of [[Thoth]] to recruit the god to solve the sphinx’s riddle. Overcoming the pyramid's traps, they reach the source of Set's power. Before they can use the divine water, Set traps them, destroying the divine water and taking Thoth's brain, but Horus saves Hathor and Bek. Sacrificing her own safety, Hathor gives Bek her bracelet as payment (for Zaya) for the afterlife and calls [[Anubis]] to take him to Zaya, letting herself be dragged to the underworld.

Absorbing Thoth's brain, Osiris's heart, Horus's other eye, and wings from [[Nephthys]], Set confronts Ra about his mistreatments, which Ra explains were tests to prepare Set for his true role: taking Ra's place aboard his solar barge as defender of the world against Apophis. Dismayed, Set decides to destroy the afterlife to become immortal. Ra blasts him with his spear, but Set survives through his absorbed powers. He stabs Ra, taking his spear and casting him off the barge, freeing Apophis to consume the mortal and underworld realms.

Zaya refuses Hathor's gift, not wanting an afterlife without Bek. Apophis attacks, and the [[Book of Gates|gate to the afterlife]] is closed. Bek returns to the mortal world, determined to stop Set and encouraging Horus that Zaya still had faith in him.

Horus battles Set atop an [[obelisk]], but is heavily outmatched. Bek throws Urshu to his death and joins the battle on the obelisk, removing Horus' stolen eye from Set's armor, but is mortally wounded. Sliding toward the edge of the obelisk, Bek throws the eye to Horus, who must choose either to catch it or to save Bek. Horus reaches for Bek, apologizing for all he has put him through. As they plummet toward the ground, Horus regains his power to transform, flying Bek to safety. Horus realizes that his true destiny was to protect his people. With renewed strength, Horus outmaneuvers and kills Set. Finding Ra wounded in space, Horus returns his spear, allowing Ra to repel Apophis, and Anubis to reopen the gates.

A child in the crowd returns Horus' other eye and the god lays a dying Bek in Osiris's tomb beside Zaya. Ra offers to bestow Horus with any power and all Horus wants is to bring Bek and Zaya back to life. The other gods are also revived, except Horus' parents who had already passed into the afterlife. Horus is crowned king and declares access to the afterlife will be paid with good deeds in life. Bek is made [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|chief advisor]] and gives Horus Hathor's bracelet; Horus leaves to rescue her from the underworld.

{{quote box|width=25%|align=right|quote= ... the world of ''Gods of Egypt'' never really existed. It is inspired by Egyptian mythology, but it makes no attempt at historical accuracy because that would be pointless — none of the events in the movie ever really happened. It is about as reality-based as ''Star Wars'' — which is not real at all ... Maybe one day if I get to make further chapters I will reveal the context of the when and where of the story. But one thing is for sure — it is not set in Ancient Egypt at all.|source= —Director Alex Proyas, December 2015&lt;ref name="groves20151215" /&gt;}}

''Gods of Egypt'' is directed by [[Alex Proyas]] based on a screenplay by [[Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless]]. The film was produced under [[Summit Entertainment]]. Proyas was contracted by Summit in May 2012, to write the screenplay with Sazama and Sharpless, and to direct the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sneider | first=Jeff | url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/proyas-in-talks-for-summit-s-gods-of-egypt-1118054227/ | title=Proyas in talks for Summit's 'Gods of Egypt' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=May 17, 2012 | accessdate=November 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proyas said he sought to make a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|big-budget]] film with an original premise, to contrast franchise films. The director cited the following films as influences on ''Gods of Egypt'': ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' (1961), ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962), ''[[The Man Who Would Be King (film)|The Man Who Would Be King]]'' (1975), ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), and [[Sergio Leone]]'s Western films.&lt;ref name="groves20160203" /&gt; [[Lionsgate]] anticipated that ''Gods of Egypt'' would be the first film in a new franchise after it finished releasing [[The Hunger Games (film series)|''The Hunger Games'' films]].&lt;ref name="faughnder"&gt;{{cite news | last=Faughnder | first=Ryan | url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-movie-projector-gods-of-egypt-20160224-story.html | title=A roughly $15-million debut is predicted for 'Gods of Egypt' -- a $140-million film | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=February 24, 2016 | accessdate=February 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
The film was shot in Australia. A crew of 200 began pre-production in [[Sydney]] in [[New South Wales]], and producers considered filming in [[Melbourne]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to take advantage of the state's tax incentive. [[Docklands Studios Melbourne]] was too booked to accommodate ''Gods of Egypt'', and producers were instead offered an airport facility for production.&lt;ref name="maddox"&gt;{{cite news | last=Maddox | first=Gary | url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/interstate-battle-for-gods-of-egypt-movie-decided-20140224-33bgl.html | title=Interstate battle for Gods of Egypt movie decided | work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=February 24, 2014 | accessdate=November 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian states New South Wales and Victoria competed to be the location of the film's production, and Summit selected NSW in February 2014. The state's deputy premier, [[Andrew Stoner]], estimated that the production would add 400 jobs to the state and contribute {{nowrap|$75}} million to its economy.&lt;ref name="frater"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Frater | first=Patrick | url=https://variety.com/2014/film/asia/summits-gods-of-egypt-heads-for-australia-shoot-1201119763/ | title=Summit's 'Gods of Egypt' Heads for Australia Shoot | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=February 24, 2014 | accessdate=November 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The union Media Entertainment &amp; Arts Alliance filed an objection with Australia's [[Fair Work Commission]] stating that the film would adopt unfair work conditions. The union contested the production being Australian enough to receive a 40% producer rebate, yet importing work conditions substandard for Australia.&lt;ref name="frater" /&gt;|group="nb"}}

[[Principal photography]] began on {{nowrap|March 19}}, 2014 at [[Fox Studios Australia]] in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Groves | first=Don | url=http://if.com.au/2014/03/21/article/Gods-of-Egypt-rolls-in-Sydney/TNGWVMXTHL.html | title=Gods of Egypt rolls in Sydney | journal=[[If Magazine]] | date=March 21, 2014 | accessdate=November 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The setting of [[Anubis]]' temple was filmed at [[Centennial Park, New South Wales|Centennial Park]] in Sydney, and visual effects were laid over the scene.&lt;ref name="groves20160210" /&gt; The production budget was {{nowrap|$140 million}}. Jon Feltheimer, the CEO of Summit's parent company [[Lionsgate]], said Lionsgate's financial exposure was under {{nowrap|$10 million}} due to tax incentives of filming in Australia, as well as foreign pre-sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McNary | first=Dave | url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/lionsgate-has-franchise-fever-looks-to-duplicate-hunger-games-success-1201198677/ | title=Lionsgate Has Franchise Fever, Looks to Duplicate 'Hunger Games' Success | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=May 30, 2014 | accessdate=November 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Busch | first=Anita | url=https://deadline.com/2016/02/lionsgate-2017-slate-star-wars-grabbed-50m-to-100m-from-mockingjay-2-1201697048/ | title=Lionsgate Plans 17 Films For 2017, Says 'Star Wars' Grabbed $50M-$100M From 'Mockingjay 2'; Stock Falls 27% | work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] | date=February 5, 2016 | accessdate=February 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian government's tax credit to have the film produced in the country covered 46% of the {{nowrap|$140 million}} production budget, and most of the remaining budget was covered by the foreign pre-sales.&lt;ref name="cunningham" /&gt;

In the film, the gods in humanoid form are {{convert|9|ft|m}} tall and in "battle beast" form are over {{convert|12|ft|m}} tall. Proyas used [[forced perspective]] and [[motion control photography]] to portray the difference in height between the actors portraying the gods and the humans. Proyas called the logistical challenge a "reverse Hobbit", referring to ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' films, in which Hobbits are depicted as shorter than humans.&lt;ref name="groves20151215"&gt;{{cite news | last=Groves | first=Don | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dongroves/2015/12/15/the-gods-of-egypt-alex-proyas-grapples-with-a-size-issue-in-fantasy-adventure/ | title='The Gods of Egypt': Alex Proyas Grapples With a Size Issue In Fantasy Adventure | work=[[Forbes]] | date=December 15, 2015 | accessdate=January 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Sphinx]], actor Kenneth Ransom portrayed the giant creature via [[motion capture]]. For the god Thoth, who can appear as many copies, actor Chadwick Boseman was filmed hundreds of times from different angles. For a scene with many copies of Thoth, other actors took a day to film the scene, where Boseman filmed the scene for three days.&lt;ref name="groves20160210"&gt;{{cite news | last=Groves | first=Don | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dongroves/2016/02/10/gods-of-egypt-unleashes-its-own-golem-a-giant-sphinx-of-stone/ | title='Gods Of Egypt' Unleashes Its Own Golem, A Giant Sphinx Of Stone | work=[[Forbes]] | date=February 10, 2016 | accessdate=February 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Composer [[Marco Beltrami]], who scored Proyas's previous films ''[[Knowing (film)|Knowing]]'' (2009) and ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' (2004), returned to score ''Gods of Egypt''.&lt;ref name="groves20151215" /&gt;

==Racial and ethnic casting==
{{See also|Whitewashing in film}}
White actors make up most of the principal cast of ''Gods of Egypt''. When [[Lionsgate]] began marketing the film, the [[Associated Press]] said the distributor received backlash for ethnically inaccurate casting. Lionsgate and director Alex Proyas both issued apologies. The AP said, "While some praised the preemptive [[mea culpa]] ... others were more skeptical, concluding that it's simply meant to shut down any further backlash."&lt;ref name="bahr"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bahr |first=Lindsey |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/c7a2e028d4c246808f9422f264f6e074/gods-egypt-renews-concern-about-inaccurate-film-casting |title='Gods of Egypt' renews concern about inaccurate film casting |work=ap.org |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=December 14, 2015 |accessdate=January 12, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dnaUNIpo?url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/c7a2e028d4c246808f9422f264f6e074/gods-egypt-renews-concern-about-inaccurate-film-casting |archivedate=December 15, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The casting practice of white actors as Egyptian characters was first reported after filming started in March 2014, when ''Daily Life''{{'}}s Ruby Hamad highlighted the practice as "Hollywood whitewashing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hamad | first=Ruby | url=http://www.dailylife.com.au/news-and-views/dl-opinion/all-lead-actors-in-the-gods-of-egypt-will-be-white-20140401-35vzp.html | title=All lead actors in The Gods of Egypt will be white | work=Daily Life | publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] | date=April 1, 2014 | accessdate=November 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lionsgate released a set of character posters in November 2015, and ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the casting received a backlash on [[Twitter]] over the predominantly white cast. Some suggested that the casting of black actor [[Chadwick Boseman]], who plays the god [[Thoth]], played into the [[Magical Negro]] stereotype. The previous year, the biblical epic ''[[Exodus: Gods and Kings]]'' by director [[Ridley Scott]] received similar backlash for having a white cast.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{cite news | last=Lee | first=Benjamin | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/13/gods-of-egypt-posters-anger-whitewashed-cast-twitter-exodus | title=Gods of Egypt posters spark anger with 'whitewashed' cast | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=November 13, 2015 | accessdate=November 13, 2015 }}

She said with the release of [[Aziz Ansari]]'s TV series ''[[Master of None]]'' in the previous week, "Whitewashed casting and the offensiveness of brownface has pretty much dominated the pop culture conversation this week. Promotion for the movie is beginning just as we're wrapping a banner year for discussions of diversity and gender pay equity in the film industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=McDonald | first=Soraya Nadia | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/11/12/gods-of-egypt-promo-posters-reveal-no-lessons-learned-from-exodus-fiasco/ | title='Gods of Egypt' promo posters reveal no lessons learned from 'Exodus' fiasco | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=November 12, 2015 | accessdate=November 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lionsgate followed its release of posters with a release of a theatrical trailer, Scott Mendelson at ''[[Forbes]]'' said, "The implication remains that white actors, even generic white actors with zero box office draw, are preferable in terms of domestic and overseas box office than culturally-specific (minority) actors who actually look like the people they are supposed to be playing."

In response to criticisms of its casting practice, director Alex Proyas and Lionsgate issued apologies in late November 2015 for not considering diversity; Lionsgate said it would strive to do better.

Boseman, who plays the god Thoth, commenting on the whitewashing, said he expected the backlash to happen when he saw the script. He said, "I'm ''thankful'' that it did, because actually, I agree with it.

In the month leading up to release, director Proyas said his film was fantasy and not intended to be history. He cited "creative license and artistic freedom of expression" to cast the actors he found to fit the roles. He said "white-washing" was a justified concern but for his fantasy film, "To exclude any one race in service of a hypothetical theory of historical accuracy ... would have been biased." Proyas said that films "need more people of color and a greater cultural diversity" but that ''Gods of Egypt'' "is not the best one to soap-box issues of diversity with". He argued that the lack of English-speaking Egyptian actors, production practicalities, the studio's requirement for box office draws, and Australia having guidelines limiting "imported" actors were all factors in casting for the film. He concluded, "I attempted to show racial diversity, black, white, Asian, as far as I was allowed, as far as I could, given the limitations I was given. It is obviously clear that for things to change, for casting in movies to become more diverse many forces must align. Not just the creative. To those who are offended by the decisions which were made I have already apologised. I respect their opinion, but I hope the context of the decisions is a little clearer based on my statements here."&lt;ref name="groves20160203"&gt;{{cite news | last=Groves | first=Don | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dongroves/2016/02/03/gods-of-egypt-silly-and-campy-or-an-unlikely-blockbuster/#3e3b28f349a4 | title='Gods Of Egypt'- Silly And Outdated, Or An Unlikely Blockbuster? | work=[[Forbes]] | date=February 3, 2016 | accessdate=February 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the film was critically panned, Proyas said, "I guess I have the knack of rubbing reviewers the wrong way.

[[Lionsgate]] spent an estimated {{nowrap|$30 million}} on marketing the film.&lt;ref name="cunningham" /&gt; It released a set of character posters in November 2015, for which it received backlash due to white actors playing Egyptian characters, as noted above.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; Later in the month, it released a theatrical trailer.&lt;ref name="mendelson" /&gt; Lionsgate aired a 60-second spot for ''Gods of Egypt'' during the [[pre-game show]] of the [[Super Bowl 50]] on February 7, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hipes | first=Patrick | url=https://deadline.com/2016/02/gods-of-egypt-super-bowl-ad-plan-lionsgate-1201697030/ | title='Gods Of Egypt' Getting 60-Second Spot In Super Bowl Pre-Game Show | work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] | date=February 5, 2016 | accessdate=February 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though they released the trailer online a day earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Lincoln | first=Ross A. | url=https://deadline.com/2016/02/new-gods-of-egypt-trailer-alex-proyas-gerard-butler-1201697792/ | title=New 'Gods Of Egypt' Trailer: Lionsgate Unleashes Super Bowl Spot A Day Early | work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] | date=February 6, 2016 | accessdate=February 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the week before the film's release, Lions released the [[tie-in]] [[mobile game]] ''Gods of Egypt: Secrets of the Lost Kingdom'' on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Hannley | first=Steve | url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2016/02/17/gods-of-egypt-movie-tie-in-game-gets-a-surprise-release/193462/ | title=Gods Of Egypt Movie Tie-In Game Gets a Surprise Release | work=Hardcore Gamer | date=February 17, 2016 | accessdate=February 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office forecast===
''[[BoxOffice (magazine)|BoxOffice]]'' forecast two months in advance that ''Gods of Egypt'' would gross {{nowrap|$14.5 million}} on its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, and that it would gross {{nowrap|$34 million}} total on its theatrical run. The magazine said the film had "a strong ensemble cast" and that its director has "had a noteworthy following". ''BoxOffice'' also said the premise could attract movie-goers who saw ''Clash of the Titans'', ''[[Wrath of the Titans]]'', and the ''[[Percy Jackson (film series)|Percy Jackson]]'' films. Admissions to 3D screenings would help boost ''Gods of Egypt''{{'}}s gross. The magazine said factors negatively affecting the film's gross were a "lackluster reaction" to its marketing and the backlash to its predominantly white cast causing negative buzz. It anticipated that the film's release would be front-loaded (focused on profiting mainly from opening weekend) due to the poor buzz, its categorization as a fantasy film, and with ''[[London Has Fallen]]'' opening the following weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Garris | first=Daniel | url=http://pro.boxoffice.com/featured_stories/2016-01-long-range-forecast-gods-of-egypt-triple-9 | title=Long Range Forecast: 'Gods Of Egypt' &amp; 'Triple 9' | work=[[BoxOffice (magazine)|BoxOffice]] | date=January 2, 2016 | accessdate=January 10, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105231654/http://pro.boxoffice.com/featured_stories/2016-01-long-range-forecast-gods-of-egypt-triple-9 | archive-date=January 5, 2016 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A week before the film's release, ''[[TheWrap]]''{{'s}} Todd Cunningham reported an updated forecast of {{nowrap|$15 million}} for its opening weekend in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name="cunningham"&gt;{{cite news | last=Cunningham | first=Todd | url=https://www.thewrap.com/gods-of-egypt-on-track-for-15-million-opening-can-it-beat-the-odds-and-launch-a-franchise/ | title='Gods of Egypt' on Track for $15 Million Opening – Can It Beat the Odds and Launch a Franchise? | work=[[TheWrap]] | date=February 19, 2016 | accessdate=February 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Pamela McClintock said it was tracking to gross between {{nowrap|$12 million}} and {{nowrap|$15 million}}.&lt;ref name="mcclintock"&gt;{{cite journal | last=McClintock | first=Pamela | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-deadpool-wont-have-869356 | title=Box-Office Preview: Big-Budget 'Gods of Egypt' Imperiled | journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=February 24, 2016 | accessdate=February 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham said the expected gross was low for the film's triple-digit budget as well as additional marketing costs. He said the film could attract Alex Proyas's fan base but that it had suffered "some negativity out there" due to the predominantly white casting as well as the film being perceived to have an "old-fashioned" feel. Exhibitor Relations senior media analyst Jeff Bock said the film "feels late" years after the release of ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' (2007) and ''[[Immortals (2011 film)|Immortals]]'' (2011), and an earlier production and release would have been more advantageous. Cunningham said with Lionsgate's financial exposure only being {{nowrap|$10 million}} and the expected opening gross, the film could gross between {{nowrap|$40 million}} and {{nowrap|$50 million}} for its theatrical run in the United States and Canada and ultimately avoid a loss.&lt;ref name="cunningham" /&gt; ''The Hollywood Reporter''{{'}}s McClintock said "ancient epics" in recent years had not performed well at the box office, citing the 2014 films ''[[Hercules (2014 film)|Hercules]]'', ''[[The Legend of Hercules]]'', and ''[[Pompeii (2014 film)|Pompeii]]''.&lt;ref name="mcclintock" /&gt;

Ryan Faughnder of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said in the week before the film's release that the expected opening weekend gross meant that Lionsgate's plans to make ''Gods of Egypt'' the first film in a new franchise were unlikely. Faughnder said the film would need to perform strongly in territories outside the United States and Canada for a sequel to be developed.&lt;ref name="faughnder" /&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Brent Lang reported that analysts said the film would need to open to {{nowrap|$30 million}} or more in the United States to justify a sequel.&lt;ref name="lang" /&gt;

===Theatrical run===
''Gods of Egypt'' grossed $31.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $119.6 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $150.7 million against a production budget of $140 million.&lt;ref name="BOM"/&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' estimated the film lost the studio up to $90 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/2016s-biggest-box-office-bombs-958780/item/box-office-bombs-gods-egypt-959603|title='Ben Hur' to 'BFG': Hollywood's Biggest Box-Office Bombs of 2016|author=Pamela McClintock|author2=Mia Galuppo|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media|Prometheus Global Media, LLC]]|date=September 8, 2016|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
''Gods of Egypt'' was panned by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McNary|first=Gary|date=February 26, 2016|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/gods-of-egypt-box-office-flop-1201716160/|title=''Gods of Egypt'' Heading for Epic Box Office Flop|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=May 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 15% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 185 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 3.39/10.&lt;!--DONT ADD CONSENSUS; PER TALK PAGE, IT DOESN'T ADD VALUE TO SECTION--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gods_of_egypt |title=Gods of Egypt (2016) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=May 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] gives the film a score of 25 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/gods-of-egypt |title=Gods of Egypt Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alonso Duralde]] of [[TheWrap]] wrote, "A mishmash of unconvincing visual effects and clumsy writing—not to mention another depiction of ancient Egypt in which the lead roles are almost all played by white folks—''Gods of Egypt'' might have merited a so-bad-it's-good [[schadenfreude]] fanbase had it maintained the unintentional laughs of its first 10 minutes. Instead, it skids into dullness, thus negating the camp classic that it so often verges on becoming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/gods-of-egypt-review-gerard-butler-nikolaj-coster-waldau-brenton-thwaites/ |title='Gods of Egypt' Review: Gerard Butler Fiasco Is the Worst Thing to Hit the Nile Since Asps |website=The Wrap |accessdate=February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joycelyn Noveck of the ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' gave the film a half star out of four, writing, "It's obvious the filmmakers were gunning for a sequel here. But this bloated enterprise is so tiresome by the end, it seems more likely headed for a long rest somewhere in the cinematic afterlife."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/post/gods-egypt-new-entry-pantheon-mythical-misfires/ |title='Gods of Egypt': A new entry in the Pantheon of Mythical misfires |website=Chicago Sun Times |accessdate=February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ignatiy Vishnevetsky]] of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' called ''Gods of Egypt'' "overlong and very silly," and said: "A treasure trove of gilded fantasy bric-a-brac and clashing accents, Proyas' sword-and-sandals space opera is a head above the likes of ''[[Wrath of the Titans]]'', but it rapidly devolves into a tedious and repetitive succession of monster chases, booby traps, and temples that start to crumble at the last minute."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.avclub.com/review/look-gods-egypt-ye-mighty-and-be-baffled-232829|title=Look on Gods Of Egypt, ye Mighty, and be baffled |website=[[The A.V. Club]] |access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan Hoffman of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said, "This is ridiculous. This is offensive. This shouldn't be, and I'm not going to say otherwise if you can't bring yourself to buy a ticket for this movie. But if you are on the fence you can always offset your karmic footprint with a donation to a charity, because this movie is a tremendous amount of fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/27/gods-of-egypt-review-ridiculous-offensive-and-tremendously-fun|title=Gods of Egypt review – ridiculous, offensive and tremendously fun|last=Hoffman|first=Jordan|date=2016-02-27|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Olly Richards of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' was heavily critical, calling the film a "catastrophe" and "the [[Dolly Parton]] of movies, without any of the knowing wit".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/gods-egypt-2/review/|title=Gods of Egypt |last=Richards |first=Olly |date=2016-06-09 |newspaper=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the reviews, director Proyas posted to [[Facebook]] calling critics "diseased vultures pecking at the bones of a dying carcass", who were "trying to peck to the rhythm of the consensus. I applaud any film-goer who values their own opinion enough to not base it on what the pack-mentality says is good or bad."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/01/gods-of-egypt-director-alex-proyas-calls-film-critics-diseased-vultures|title=Gods of Egypt director Alex Proyas calls film critics 'diseased vultures'|last=Lee|first=Benjamin|date=2016-03-01|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
