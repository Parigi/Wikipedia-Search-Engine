== Early life ==
Palfrey was born in the [[Pittsburgh]] area town of [[Charleroi, Pennsylvania]], but spent her teens in [[Orlando, Florida]]. Her father was a grocer. She graduated from [[Rollins College]] with a degree in [[criminal justice]], and completed a nine-month legal course at the [[Thomas Jefferson School of Law]].&lt;ref name="Abhor"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/28/AR2007042801192.html?nav=rss_politics|title='I Abhor Injustice,' Alleged Madam Says|date=April 29, 2007|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=April 29, 2007|archivedate=April 9, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fwp-dyn%2Fcontent%2Farticle%2F2007%2F04%2F28%2FAR2007042801192.html%3Fnav%3Drss_politics&amp;date=2016-04-09|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working as a [[paralegal]] in [[San Diego, California]], she became involved in the escort business. Dismayed at how most services were run, including widespread [[Substance abuse|drug abuse]], she started her own company, recruiting mostly women over 25.&lt;ref name="Abhor" /&gt; In 1990, she was arrested on charges of [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimping]], [[Procuring (prostitution)|pandering]] and [[extortion]]; after fleeing to [[Montana]] she was captured while trying to cross the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]] and brought back for trial. Following her conviction in 1992 she spent 18 months in prison.&lt;ref name="Abhor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arrest1990"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20070401/news_1n1madam.html|title=Former madam comes across as an enigma|date=April 1, 2007|publisher=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |access-date=April 1, 2007 | archivedate=2016-04-09 | url-status= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409053616/http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20070401/news_1n1madam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her release, she founded Pamela Martin and Associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.10zenmonkeys.com/2008/05/03/death-of-a-madam/|title=Death of a Madam|access-date=November 16, 2008 | date=2008-05-03 | author=Lou Cabron | publisher=[[10 Zen Monkeys]] | archivedate=2016-01-16 | url-status= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116124631/http://www.10zenmonkeys.com/2008/05/03/death-of-a-madam/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== D.C. Madam scandal ==
In October 2006, [[United States Postal Inspection Service]] agents posed as a couple who were interested in buying Palfrey's home as a means of accessing her property without a [[warrant (law)|warrant]].&lt;ref name=zenmonkeys&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.10zenmonkeys.com/2007/08/27/the-dc-madam-speaks/|title=The D.C.

Madam" Scandal | author = | url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senator-caught-in-dc-madam-scandal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2007, Palfrey reacted to the suicide by [[hanging]] of Brandi Britton, one of her former escort service employees, by saying, "I guess I'm made of something that Brandi Britton wasn't made of."&lt;ref name="TIME050108" /&gt;

Palfrey's escorts charged as much as $300 per hour, and many have had professional careers. Palfrey continued to reside in [[California]], and cleared some US$2 million over 13 years in operation.&lt;ref name="Abhor" /&gt; Palfrey appeared on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]'' as part of an investigative report on May 4, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/04/dc_madam_speaks.html|title="D.C.

In combination with Palfrey's statement that she had 10,000 to 15,000 phone numbers of [[Client (prostitution)|clients]], several clients' [[lawyer]]s contacted Palfrey to see whether accommodations could be made to keep their identities private.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Montes|first1=Sue Anne Pressley|title=Escort-service scandal set to ignite D.C. explosion|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/escort-service-scandal-set-to-ignite-dc-explosion/|website=The Seattle Times|access-date=2 April 2018|date=29 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, [[ABC News]], after going through what was described as "46 lb" [21&amp;nbsp;kg] of phone records, decided that none of the potential clients&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deborahjeanepalfrey.com/telephoneRecords.html |title=Deborah Jeane Palfrey - Telephone Records |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914201151/http://www.deborahjeanepalfrey.com/telephoneRecords.html |archivedate=September 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was sufficiently "newsworthy" to bother mentioning.&lt;ref name="theind"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2516738.ece|title=Network refuses to name clients of 'DC madam'|access-date=July 10, 2007|first=Andrew|last=Buncombe|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=May 6, 2007 | archivedate=2007-12-30 | url-status= | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230011724/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2516738.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

However, ''ABC News'' only published two of the names they had identified, men who were already known to have been clients of Palfrey&amp;nbsp;— [[Randall L. Tobias]], a State Department official, and [[Harlan K. Ullman]], a Defense Department official.&lt;ref name="Nytimes2007-05-05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AbcNews2007-04-27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cnn2007-04-28" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wapo2007-04-28" /&gt;&lt;ref name="State2007-04-28" /&gt; Journalist [[Neil Lewis (journalist)|Neil A. Lewis]] reported, in ''The New York Times'', that ''[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'' would not publicize any new names.&lt;ref name="Nytimes2007-05-05" /&gt;

The witnesses were compelled to testify, after being granted immunity from prosecution.
In May 2007 a team at ''[[ABC News]]'' reported on their efforts to determine the identities of Palfrey's clients, from her phone records.&lt;ref name="Abc2007-05-04" /&gt; They reported how many of Palfrey's clients phoned from hotel rooms, to obfuscate their identities. They found some clients had exaggerated their importance—one who had bragged about his role in evacuating colleagues from the [[White House]] on 9/11 turned out to merely work near The White House. 

On April 15, 2008, a jury found Palfrey guilty of [[money laundering]], using the mail for illegal purposes and racketeering.&lt;ref name="AP050308" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC041508" /&gt; Palfrey believed that contrary to the U.S. Attorney's Office lower estimate, she might spend six or seven years behind bars.&lt;ref name="OS050208" /&gt; She faced a maximum of 55 years in prison.&lt;ref name="WTOP050208"&gt;{{Cite web|date=May 2, 2008|url=http://www.wtop.com/?sid=1396668&amp;nid=25|title=911 tapes released in D.C.

== Death ==
On May 1, 2008, Palfrey was found hanging in a storage shed outside her mother's [[mobile home]] in [[Tarpon Springs, Florida]]. Police found handwritten suicide notes in the bedroom where she was staying, dated a week before her death. The autopsy and the final police investigation concluded her death was a suicide.&lt;ref name="FMT103108"&gt;{{Cite web|date=October 31, 2008|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,445538,00.html|title=Police Close 'D.C.

=== Suicide notes ===
Palfrey's two handwritten notes were released to the public. In one of them, she wrote to her sister, "You must comprehend there was no way out, I.E. 'exit strategy,' for me other than the one I have chosen here." In another, she described her predicament as a "modern-day [[lynching]]". She said she feared that, at the end of serving her sentence, she would be "in my late 50s a broken, penniless and very much alone woman".&lt;ref name="JG050608" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=[[CNN]] |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/05/05/dc.madam/#cnnSTCOther1 |date=May 5, 2008 |access-date=May 5, 2008 |title=D.C.

In early 2007, Palfrey learned of the death, apparently through suicide by [[hanging]], of [[Brandi Britton]], one of her former escort service employees.&lt;ref name="TIME050108" /&gt; Palfrey reacted to this news by saying, "I guess I'm made of something that Brandy Britton wasn't made of." According to her former attorney, [[Montgomery Blair Sibley]], she even took the extraordinary step of writing directly to the prosecutor, promising to show more resolve than Britton.&lt;ref name=WhyJustHer /&gt;

Journalist [[Dan Moldea]], who was working with Palfrey on a book, recalled that in a 2007 conversation, Palfrey told him, "I am not going back to prison. I will commit suicide first."&lt;ref name="OS050208"&gt;{{Cite web|date=May 2, 2008|last=Mairano|first=Willoughby|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/orange/orl-madam0208may02,0,4270322.story|title=D.C. madam's mystery death: The Orlando connection|publisher=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|access-date=May 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said her previous prison experience had [[psychological trauma|traumatized]] her and she felt she couldn't do it again.&lt;ref name="AP050308" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TIME050108"&gt;{{Cite news|date=May 1, 2008 |last=Zagorin |first=Adam |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1736687,00.html |title=D.C.

== Palfrey's customer list ==
On July 9, 2007, Palfrey released the supposed entirety of her phone records for public viewing and downloading on the Internet in [[TIFF]] format, though days prior to this, her civil attorney Montgomery Blair Sibley had dispatched 54 [[CD-ROM]] copies to researchers, activists, and journalists.
