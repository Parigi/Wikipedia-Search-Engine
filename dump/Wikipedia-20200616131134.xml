==Terminology==
The term is derived from the [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] {{lang|la|peccatum Sodomiticum}} or "sin of Sodom", which in turn comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc|Σόδομα}} (Sódoma).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myetymology.com/english/sodomy.html myetymology.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916041421/http://www.myetymology.com/english/sodomy.html |date=2012-09-16 }}, Sodomy&lt;/ref&gt; [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] (chapters 18–20) tells how God wished to destroy the "sinful" cities of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. Two angels are invited by [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] to take refuge with his family for the night. The men of Sodom surround Lot's house and demand that he bring the messengers out so that they may "know" them (the expression includes sexual connotations). Lot protests that the "messengers" are his guests and offers the Sodomites his virgin daughters instead, but then they threaten to "do worse" with Lot than they would with his guests. Then the angels strike the Sodomites blind, "so that they wearied themselves to find the door." (Genesis 19:4-11, [[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]])

In current usage, the term is particularly used in law. [[Sodomy law|Laws]] prohibiting sodomy were seen frequently in past Jewish, Christian, and Islamic civilizations, but the term has little modern usage outside Africa, Asia, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sodomylaws.org/ sodomy laws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704130716/http://www.sodomylaws.org/ |date=2007-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws in the United States have been challenged and have sometimes been found unconstitutional or been replaced with different legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html|title=''Lawrence v. Texas'' in which The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that sodomy laws are unconstitutional on June 26, 2003|author=|date=|website=cornell.edu|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406071731/https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html|archivedate=6 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cognates in other languages, such as [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|[[:fr:sodomie|sodomie]]}} (verb {{lang|fr|sodomiser}}), [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{lang|es|[[:es:sodomía|sodomía]]}} (verb {{lang|es|sodomizar}}), and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{lang|pt|[[:pt:sodomia|sodomia]]}} (verb {{lang|pt|sodomizar}}), are used exclusively for penetrative anal sex, at least since the early nineteenth century. In those languages, the term is also often current [[vernacular]] (not just legal, unlike in other cultures) and a formal way of referring to any practice of anal penetration; the word ''sex'' is commonly associated with consent and pleasure with regard to all involved parties and often avoids directly mentioning two common aspects of social [[taboo]]—human sexuality and the anus—without a shunning or archaic connotation to its use.

In modern [[German language|German]], the word {{lang|de|[[:de:Sodomie|Sodomie]]}} has no connotation of anal or oral sex and specifically refers to [[zoophilia|bestiality]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Paragraph 175#Version of June 28.2C 1935|Paragraph 175 StGB, version of June 28, 1935]].&lt;/ref&gt; The same goes for the [[Polish language|Polish]] {{lang|pl|[[:pl:sodomia|sodomia]]}}. The [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] word {{lang|no|[[:no:sodomi|sodomi]]}} carries both senses. In [[Danish language|Danish]], {{lang|da|[[:da:sodomi|sodomi]]}} is rendered as "unnatural [[carnal knowledge]] with [[Gay sexual practices|someone of the same sex]] or (now) with [[Zoophilia|animals]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ordnet.dk/ods/ordbog?query=sodomi "Sodomi"] (''[[Ordbog over det danske Sprog]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], the word for sodomy,  {{lang|ar|لواط|rtl=yes}} (Arabic pronunciation: {{lang|ar-Latn|liwāṭ}}; Persian pronunciation {{lang|fa-Latn|lavât}}), is derived from the same source as in Western culture, with much the same connotations as English (referring to most sexual acts prohibited by the [[Qur'an]]). Its direct reference is to [[Islamic view of Lot|Lot]] (لوط ''Lūṭ'' in Arabic) and a more literal interpretation of the word is "the practice of Lot", but more accurately it means "the practice of Lot's people" (the Sodomites) rather than Lot himself.
 
The word ''[[wikt:sod#Etymology 2|sod]]'', a noun or verb (to "sod off") used as an insult, is derived from ''sodomite''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sod Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary. Main Entry: sod] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422175451/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sod |date=2009-04-22 }}&lt;nowiki&gt;[3,noun]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. "Etymology: short for sodomite. Date: 1818."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/sod_2?view=uk sod&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Compact Oxford English Dictionary, "ORIGIN abbreviation of SODOMITE." June 23, 2005.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517165036/http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/sod_2?view=uk |date=May 17, 2008 }} {{ISBN|978-0-19-861022-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a general-purpose insult term for anyone the speaker dislikes without specific reference to their sexual behaviour. ''Sod'' is used as slang in the United Kingdom and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and is considered mildly offensive. However, in New Zealand and Australia it is not considered offensive at all, but only 'coarse', because it is locally assumed, even if incorrectly, that it refers to 'sod' as in a wet clump of dirt.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

While religion and the law have had a fundamental role in the historical definition and punishment of sodomy, sodomitical texts present considerable opportunities for ambiguity and interpretation. Sodomy is both a real occurrence and an imagined category. In the course of the eighteenth century, what is identifiable as sodomy often becomes identified with effeminacy, for example, or in opposition to a discourse of manliness. In this regard, Ian McCormick has argued that "an adequate and imaginative reading involves a series of intertextual interventions in which histories become stories, fabrications and reconstructions in lively debate with, and around, 'dominant' heterosexualities ... Deconstructing what we think we see may well involve reconstructing ourselves in surprising and unanticipated ways."&lt;ref&gt;Ian McCormick, ''Secret Sexualities: A Sourcebook of 17th and 18th Century Writing.'' (London and New York: Routledge), p. 9, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buggery===
The modern English word "[[bugger]]" is derived from the French term ''{{lang|fr|bougre}}'', that evolved from the [[Latin]] ''[[Bulgars|Bulgarus]]'' or "Bulgarian". The [[Catholic Church]] used the word to describe members of a religious [[sect]] known as the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], who originated in [[Bulgarian Empire|medieval Bulgaria]] in the 10th Century and spread throughout [[Western Europe]] by the 15th Century. The Church used it as a term of offence against a group they considered [[heretic]]al. The first use of the word "buggery" appears in [[Middle English]] in 1330 where it is associated with "abominable heresy"; though the sexual sense of "bugger" is not recorded until 1555.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/24372?redirectedFrom=buggery#eid}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology'' quotes a similar form: "bowgard" (and "bouguer"), but claims that the Bulgarians were heretics "as belonging to the Greek Church, sp. [[Albigensian Crusade|Albigensian]]". Webster's ''Third New International Dictionary'' gives the only meaning of the word "bugger" as a sodomite, "from the adherence of the Bulgarians to the Eastern Church considered heretical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bogomilism Study |url=http://www.bogomilism.eu/Studies/Bugger%20case.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810053756/http://bogomilism.eu/Studies/Bugger%20case.html |archivedate=2015-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bugger'' is still commonly used in modern English as an exclamation, while "buggery" is synonymous with the act of sodomy.

==History==
[[File:John Martin - Sodom and Gomorrah.jpg|thumb|''The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah'', John Martin, 1852]]
===Hebrew Bible===
In the Hebrew Bible, [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] was a city destroyed by God because of the evil of its inhabitants. No specific sin is given as the reason for God's great wrath. The story of Sodom's destruction — and of [[Abraham]]'s failed attempt to intercede with God and prevent that destruction — appears in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 18-19.  The connection between Sodom and homosexuality is derived from the described attempt by a mob of the city's people to rape [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]'s male guests. Some suggest the sinfulness for which Sodom was destroyed might have consisted mainly in the violation of obligations of hospitality, which were important for the original writers of the Biblical account.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, pp. 92–98&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 19-21, there is an account, similar in many ways, where Gibeah, a city of the Benjamin tribe, is destroyed by the other tribes of Israel in revenge for a mob of its inhabitants raping and killing a woman.
Neither view about why Sodom was destroyed takes into account the fact that its destruction was planned before the guests arrived in the city, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 18:17.

Many times in the [[Torah|Pentateuch]] and [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], writers use God's destruction of Sodom to demonstrate His awesome power. This happens in [[Deuteronomy]] 29; [[Isaiah]] 1, 3, and 13; [[Jeremiah]] 49 and 50; [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 4; [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 4.11; and [[Zephaniah]] 2.9. Deuteronomy 32, Jeremiah 23.14, and Lamentations 4 reference the sinfulness of Sodom but do not specify any particular sin.

Specific sins which Sodom is linked to by the prophets of the Old Testament are [[adultery]] and [[lie|lying]] ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|23:14|KJV|}}).

In Ezekiel 16, a long comparison is made between Sodom and the [[kingdom of Judah]]. "Yet you have not merely walked in their ways or done according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you acted more corruptly in all your conduct than they." (v. 47, NASB) "Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy. Thus they were haughty and committed abominations before Me. (vss. 49–50, NASB) (Note that the Hebrew for the word "thus" is the conjunction "ו" which is usually translated "and", thus KJV, NIV, and CEV omit the word entirely.)

There is no explicit mention of any sexual sin in Ezekiel's summation and "abomination" is used to describe many sins.

The [[Authorized King James Version]] translates {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|23:17|KJV}} as "There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel," but the word corresponding to "sodomite" in the Hebrew original, Qadesh ([[Hebrew]]:קדש), does not refer to Sodom and has been translated in the [[New International Version]] as "[[Sacred prostitution|shrine prostitute]]"; male shrine prostitutes may have served barren women in fertility rites rather than engaging in homosexual acts; this also applies to other instances of the word sodomite in the King James Version.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Roman Empire period===

====New Testament====
The [[New Testament]], like the [[Old Testament]], references Sodom as a place of God's anger against sin, but the [[Epistle of Jude]] provides a certain class of sin as causative of its destruction, the meaning of which is disputed.

{{quotation|1=Jude 1:5  I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.
&lt;br&gt;6  And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
&lt;br&gt;7  Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.|2=[[Authorized King James Version]]&lt;br&gt;[http://studybible.info/compare/Jude%201:7 Compare Jude 1:7 in multiple versions]}}

The Greek word in the New Testament from which the phrase is translated "giving themselves over to fornication", is "ekporneuō" ("ek" and "porneuō"). As one word it is not used elsewhere in the New Testament, but occurs in the [[Septuagint]] to denote whoredom (Genesis 38:24 and Exodus 34:15). Some modern translations as the [[NIV]] render it as "sexual immorality".

The Greek words for "strange flesh" are "heteros", which almost always basically denotes "another/other", and "sarx",  a common word for "flesh", and usually refers to the physical body or the nature of man or of an ordinance.

In the Christian expansion of the prophets, they further linked Sodom to the sins of [[impenitence]] ({{bibleverse||Matthew|11:23|KJV|}}), careless living ({{bibleverse||Luke|17:28|KJV|}}), [[fornication]] ({{bibleverse||Jude|1:7|KJV|}} [[KJV]]), and an overall "filthy" lifestyle ({{bibleverse|2|Peter|2:7|KJV|}}), which word ("aselgeiais") elsewhere is rendered in the KJV as [[lasciviousness]] ({{bibleverse||Mark|7:22|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|12:21|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse||Ephesians|4:19|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|1|Peter|4:3|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse||Jude|1:4|KJV|}}) or [[incontinence (philosophy)|wantonness]] ({{bibleverse||Romans|13:13|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Peter|2:18|KJV|}}).

====Epistle of Jude====
The [[Epistle of Jude]] in the New Testament echoes the Genesis narrative and potentially adds the sexually immoral aspects of Sodom's sins: "just as [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire". (v. 7, English Standard Version). The phrase rendered "sexual immorality and unnatural desire" is translated "strange flesh" or "false flesh", but it is not entirely clear what it refers to.

One theory is that it is just a reference to the "strange flesh" of the intended rape victims, who were angels, not men.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Countering this is traditional interpretation, which notes that the angels were sent to investigate an ongoing regional problem(Gn. 18) of fornication, and extraordinarily so, that of a homosexual nature,&lt;ref&gt;Albert Barnes' Notes on the Bible&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent's Word Studies&lt;/ref&gt;  "out of the order of nature."&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on the Old and New Testaments by Robert Jamieson, A. R. Fausset and David Brown&lt;/ref&gt; "Strange" is understood to mean "outside the moral law",&lt;ref&gt;Word pictures in the New Testament, Archibald Thomas Robertson&lt;/ref&gt; ({{bibleverse||Romans|7:3|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Galatians|1:6|KJV}}) while it is doubted that either Lot or the men of Sodom understood that the strangers were angels at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Gn. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philo====
The [[Hellenistic]] [[Jewish]] [[philosopher]] [[Philo]] (20 BC - 50 AD)  described the inhabitants of Sodom in an extra biblical account:

"As men, being unable to bear discreetly a satiety of these things, get restive like cattle, and become stiff-necked, and discard the laws of nature, pursuing a great and intemperate indulgence of gluttony, and drinking, and unlawful connections; for not only did they go mad after other women, and defile the marriage bed of others, but also those who were men lusted after one another, doing unseemly things, and not regarding or respecting their common nature, and though eager for children, they were convicted by having only an abortive offspring; but the conviction produced no advantage, since they were overcome by violent desire; and so by degrees, the men became accustomed to be treated like women, and in this way engendered among themselves the disease of females, and intolerable evil; for they not only, as to effeminacy and delicacy, became like women in their persons, but they also made their souls most ignoble, corrupting in this way the whole race of men, as far as depended on them" (133-35; ET Jonge 422-23).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/8326130/The-Works-of-Philo The works of Philo a contemporary of Josephius] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119043027/http://www.scribd.com/doc/8326130/The-Works-of-Philo |date=2016-01-19 }} Page 528&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] used the term "Sodomites" in summarizing the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] narrative: "About this time the Sodomites grew proud, on account of their riches and great wealth; they became unjust towards men, and impious towards [[God]], in so much that they did not call to mind the advantages they received from him: they hated strangers, and abused themselves with Sodomitical practices" "Now when the Sodomites saw the young men to be of beautiful countenances, and this to an extraordinary degree, and that they took up their lodgings with Lot, they resolved themselves to enjoy these beautiful boys by force and violence; and when Lot exhorted them to sobriety, and not to offer any thing immodest to the strangers, but to have regard to their lodging in his house; and promised that if their inclinations could not be governed, he would expose his daughters to their lust, instead of these strangers; neither thus were they made ashamed." (''Antiquities'' 1.11.1,3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/ant-1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-31 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216095250/http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/ant-1.htm |archivedate=2009-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; — circa AD 96). His assessment goes beyond the Biblical data, though it is seen by conservatives as defining what manner of fornication (Jude 1:7) Sodom was given to.{{cn|date=September 2019}}

===Medieval Christendom===
[[File:Dante sodom.jpg|thumb|[[Dante]] and [[Virgil]] interview the sodomites, from {{Interlanguage link multi|Guido da Pisa|it}}'s commentary on the ''Commedia'', c. 1345]]

The primarily sexual meaning of the word ''sodomia'' for Christians did not evolve before the 6th century AD.{{Citation needed|date 2019-0613|date=June 2019}} [[Byzantine Emperor|Roman Emperor]] [[Justinian I]], in his novels no. 77 (dating 538) and no. 141 (dating 559) amended to his [[Corpus iuris civilis]], and declared that Sodom's sin had been specifically same-sex activities and desire for them. He also linked "famines, earthquakes, and pestilences"  upon cities as being due to "such crimes",&lt;ref&gt;trans. in Derrick Sherwin Bailey, Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition, (London: Longmans, Green, 1955), 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; during a time of recent earthquakes and other disasters (see [[Extreme weather events of 535–536]]). While adhering to the death penalty by beheading as punishment for homosexuality or adultery, Justinian's legal novels heralded a change in Roman legal paradigm&lt;ref&gt;For the legal and cultural background in [[Roman Republic|Republican]] and [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]] prior to Christian rule, see [[Sexuality in ancient Rome]] and ''[[Lex Scantinia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; in that he introduced a concept of not only secular but also divine punishment for homosexual behavior.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Christians earlier than Justinian are also seen to denounce same-sex relations. St. [[John Chrysostom]] in the 4th century regarded such as worse than murder in his fourth homily on {{bibleverse||Romans|1:26-27|KJV}} [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210204.htm], while [[Paul the Apostle]] in the ''[[Epistle to the Romans]]'' referred to same sex relations as ''"shameful lust"'' and which acts were contrary to nature,  with men suffering a ''"due penalty"'' in their bodies. Just like the Jews, early Christians prior to Justinian I are not known to have used the word ''sodomia'' for the carnal sin they abhorred, though [[Philo of Alexandria]] (20 BC - 50 AD)&lt;ref&gt;Jewish philosopher, Writing on the life of Abraham&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Methodius of Olympus]] (AD 260-312)&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on the sin of Sodom&lt;/ref&gt; attributed homosexual relations to Sodom, as may have Josephus, (AD 37 – c. 100)&lt;ref&gt;Antiquities 1.11.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;33-34; ET Jonge 422-23; The Sodom tradition in Romans Biblical Theology Bulletin, Spring, 2004 by Philip F.

Justinian's interpretation of the story of Sodom may have been forgotten today (as some{{who?|date=September 2019}} hold it had been, along with his law novelizations regarding homosexual behavior immediately after his death) had it not been made use of in fake [[Charlemagne|Charlemagnian]] [[capitularies]], fabricated by a [[Franks|Frankish]] monk using the pseudonym Benedictus Levita ("Benedict the Levite") around 850 AD, as part of the [[Pseudo-Isidore]]. Benedict's three capitularies particularly dealing with Justinian's interpretation of the story of Sodom were:

*''XXI. De diversis malorum flagitiis.'' ("No. 21: On manifold disgraceful wrongs")
*''CXLIII. De sceleribus nefandis ob quae regna percussa sunt, ut penitus caveantur.'' ("No. 143: On sinful vices due to which empires have crumbled, so that we shall do our best to beware of them")
*''CLX. De patratoribus diversorum malorum.'' ("No. 160: On the perpetrators of manifold evil deeds")

Burning had been part of the standard penalty for homosexual behavior particularly common in Germanic [[protohistory]] (as according to Germanic folklore, sexual deviance and especially same-sex desire were caused by a form of malevolence or spiritual evil called ''[[Nīþ|nith]]'', rendering those people characterized by it as non-human fiends, as ''nithings''), and Benedictus most probably was of the Germanic tribe of the Franks.{{cn|date=September 2019}} Benedict broadened the meaning for ''sodomy'' to all sexual acts not related to procreation that were therefore deemed ''counter nature'' (so for instance, even solitary masturbation and anal intercourse between a male and a female were covered), while among these he still emphasized all interpersonal acts not taking place between human men and women, especially homosexuality.{{cn|date=September 2019}}
[[File:Execution Sodomites Ghent 1578 (1).jpg|thumb|Monks accused of sodomy burned at the stake, [[Ghent]] 1578]]
Benedict's rationale was that the punishment of such acts was in order to protect all Christianity from divine punishments such as natural disasters for carnal sins committed by individuals, but also for heresy, superstition and heathenry. Because his crucial demands for capital punishment had been so unheard of in ecclesiastical history priorly based upon the humane Christian concept of forgiveness and mercy, it took several centuries before Benedict's demands for legal reform began to take tangible shape within larger ecclesiastical initiatives.

This came about with the [[Medieval Inquisition]] in 1184. The sects of [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]] were a common target, and these heretics were not only persecuted for alleged satanism but were increasingly accused of fornication and sodomy.  In 1307, accusations of sodomy and homosexuality were major charges levelled during the [[Trial of the Knights Templar]].  Some of these charges were specifically directed at the Grand Master of the order, [[Jacques de Molay]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman "The Guilt of the Templars" (New York: Basic Books, 1966): 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is this event which led into the medieval and early-modern [[witch hunts]] that were also largely connoted with sodomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Templars|author=W. A. P.|authorlink=Walter Alison Phillips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persecution of Cathars and the [[Bogomiles]] sect in [[Bulgaria]] led to the use of a term closely related to ''sodomy'': ''buggery'' derives from French ''bouggerie'', meaning "of Bulgaria".&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; The association of ''sodomy'' with hereticism, satanism, and witchcraft was supported by the Inquisition trials.{{cn|date=September 2019}} 

The [[Book of Wisdom]], which is included in the Biblical canon by Orthodox and Roman Catholics, but excluded by modern Jews, Protestants, and other Christian denominations, makes reference to the story of Sodom, further emphasizing that their sin had been failing to practice hospitality:

:"And punishments came upon the sinners not without former signs by the force of thunders: for they suffered justly according to their own wickedness, insomuch as they used a more hard and hateful behavior toward strangers."
:"For the Sodomites did not receive those, whom they knew not when they came: but these brought friends into bondage, that had well deserved of them." ([[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/kjv.Wis.19.html#Wis.19.13 Wisdom 19:13-14])

===Sodomy laws in 18th-century Europe===

An examination of trials for rape and sodomy during the 18th century at the [[Old Bailey]] in London shows that the treatment of rape was often lenient, while the treatment of sodomy was often severe. However, the difficulty of proving that penetration and ejaculation had occurred meant that men were often convicted of the lesser charge of 'assault with sodomitical intent', which was not a capital offence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Crimes.jsp#assaultwithsodomiticalintent Crimes tried at the Old Bailey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602121130/https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Crimes.jsp |date=2017-06-02 }}, ''Proceedings of the Old Bailey'' online&lt;/ref&gt;  Sodomy crimes in England could mean "sexually assaulting a young child" and could result in a sentence of [[death recorded]], i.e., not an actual death sentence at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zipporah Osei |title=An Author Learned of a Mortifying Research Mistake Live on the Radio.

In France in the 18th century, sodomy was still theoretically a capital crime, and there are a handful of cases where sodomites were executed. However, in several of these, other crimes were involved as well. Records from the Bastille and the police lieutenant d'Argenson, as well as other sources, show that many who were arrested were exiled, sent to a regiment, or imprisoned in places (generally the Hospital) associated with moral crimes such as prostitution. Of these, a number were involved in prostitution or had approached children, or otherwise gone beyond merely having homosexual relations. Ravaisson (a 19th-century writer who edited the Bastille records) suggested that the authorities preferred to handle these cases discreetly, lest public punishments in effect publicize "this vice".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=since April 2010 section template}}

Periodicals of the time sometimes casually named known sodomites, and at one point even suggested that sodomy was increasingly popular. This does not imply that sodomites necessarily lived in security - specific police agents, for instance, watched the [[Tuileries]], even then a known cruising area. But, as with much sexual behaviour under the Old Regime, discretion was a key concern on all sides (especially since members of prominent families were sometimes implicated) - the law seemed most concerned with those who were the least discreet.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=since April 2010 section template}}

In 1730, there was a wave of sodomy trials in the [[Netherlands]]; some 250 men were summoned before the authorities; 91 faced decrees of exile for not appearing. At least 60 men were sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;Rictor Norton, [http://rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/1730news.htm The Dutch Purge of Homosexuals 1730] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518101647/http://rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/1730news.htm |date=2012-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religions==
===Judaism===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw ''good''.
:— [[Authorized King James Version|KJV]], {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|16:49-50|KJV}}).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Classical Jewish texts are seen by many as not stressing the homosexual aspect of the attitude of the inhabitants of Sodom as much as their cruelty and lack of [[hospitality]] to the "stranger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rictornorton.co.uk/homopho2.htm|title=A History of Homophobia: 2 The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah|author=|date=|website=rictornorton.co.uk|accessdate=7 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608042052/http://rictornorton.co.uk/homopho2.htm|archivedate=8 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 13th-century Jewish scholar [[Nachmanides]] wrote, "According to our sages, they were notorious for every evil, but their fate was sealed for their persistence in not supporting the poor and the needy." His contemporary Rabbenu Yonah expresses the same view: "Scripture attributes their annihilation to their failure to practice ''[[tzedakah]]'' [charity or justice]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shemayisrael.co.il/publicat/hazon/tzedaka/Tzedakah_Activists_Vs_Sodomites.html|title=Tzedakah Activists Vs.

Prohibitions on same-sex activities among men (#157) and bestiality (#155–156) are among the [[613 commandments]] as listed by [[Maimonides]] in the 12th century; however, their source in [[Leviticus 18]] does not contain the word ''sodomy''. The idea that homosexual intercourse was involved as at least a part of the evil of Sodom arises from the story in [[Genesis 19]] (NIV):

{{quote|Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom—both young and old—surrounded the house. They called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them." ({{Bibleref2|Genesis|19:4-7|KJV;NIV|Gen.19:4&amp;ndash;7 compare}})}}

===Christianity===
The traditional interpretation sees the primary sin of Sodom as being homoerotic sexual acts,&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. J. Gagnon, ''The Bible and Homosexual Practice'', pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westernsem.edu/files/westernsem/gagnon_autm05_0.pdf Gagnon, ''Why the Disagreement over the Biblical Witness on Homosexual Practice'', pp. 46–50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512090559/http://www.westernsem.edu/files/westernsem/gagnon_autm05_0.pdf |date=2008-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; connecting the Sodom narrative with [[Leviticus 18]], which lists various sexual crimes, which, according to verses 27 and 28, would result in the land being "defiled":

{{quote|for the inhabitants of the land, who were before you, committed all of these abominations, and the land became defiled; otherwise the land will vomit you out for defiling it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.}}

Some scholars, such as Per-Axel Sverker, align this passage with the traditional interpretation, claiming that the word [[Abomination (Bible)|abomination]] refers to sexual misconduct, and that while homoerotic acts were not the only reason Sodom and Gomorrah were condemned, it was a significant part of the picture.

Others, the earliest of whom was [[D.S. Bailey|Derrick Sherwin Bailey]], claim that this passage contradicts the traditional interpretation altogether. In their view the sins of Sodom were related more to violation of [[hospitality]] laws than sexual sins.&lt;ref&gt;Derrick Bailey, ''Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition'' (Hamden: Conn.: Archon, 1975 reprint from 1955), 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; This also coincides with traditional Jewish interpretations of these texts as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Destruction of Sodom|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/246615/jewish/The-Destruction-of-Sodom.htm|website=Chabad.org|publisher=Chabad (Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic movement)|accessdate=4 April 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402022353/http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/246615/jewish/The-Destruction-of-Sodom.htm|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary word in contention is the Hebrew word ''yâda‛'' used for ''know'' in the Old Testament. Biblical scholars disagree on what "know" in this instance refers to, but most of conservative Christianity interprets it to mean "sexual intercourse",&lt;ref&gt;Greg Bahnsen, ''Homosexuality: A Biblical View'' (Phillipsburg: Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing, 1978), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Reformed Response to Daniel Helminiak's Gay Theology'', by Derrick K. Olliff and Dewey H. Hodges&lt;/ref&gt; while the opposing position interprets it to mean "interrogate."&lt;ref&gt;John J. McNeil, ''The Church and the Homosexual'', p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Lot's offering of his two virgins has been interpreted to mean that Lot is offering a compromise to assure the crowd that the two men have no untoward intentions in town, or that he is offering his virgins as a substitute for the men to "know" by sexual intercourse.

Those who oppose the interpretation of sexual intent toward Lot's guests point out that there are over 930 occurrences of the Hebrew word (yâda‛) for "know" in the Old Testament, and its use to denote sexual intercourse only occurs about a dozen times, and in the [[Septuagint]] it is not rendered sexually. Countering this is the argument that most of the uses of ''yâda‛'' denoting sex is in Genesis,&lt;ref&gt;''Homosexuality and the Old Testament'', P. Michael Ukleja&lt;/ref&gt; (including once for premarital sex: Genesis 38:26), and in verse 8 sex the obvious meaning. Its use in the parallel story in Judges 19 is also invoked in support of this meaning,&lt;ref&gt;''Sodom: Inhospitality or Homosexuality?'', by Dave Miller, Ph.D., Apologetics Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. James B. DeYoung, ''Homosexuality'', pp. 118–122&lt;/ref&gt; with it otherwise providing the only instance of "knowing" someone by violence.

===Islam===
While the [[Quran]] clearly disapproves of the sexual practices of the "people of Lot" ("What, of all creatures do ye come unto the males, and leave the wives your Lord created for you?"&lt;ref&gt;Sura 26:165–167, quoted in Wafer, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;), only one passage has sometimes been interpreted as taking a particular legal position towards such activities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQuHFPKp8L0C&amp;pg=PA88|last=Wafer |first=Jim |chapter=Muhammad and Male Homosexuality |editor=Stephen O.

Most exegetes hold that these verses refer to illicit heterosexual relationships, although a minority view attributed to the [[Mu'tazilite]] scholar Abu Muslim al-Isfahani interpreted them as referring to homosexual relations.
