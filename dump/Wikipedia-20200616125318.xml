== Early life and education ==
Lapin was born on January 1, 1947, in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jewish News of Greater Phoenix |title=Forgiving New Jewish Ties |url=http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/971114/safrica.shtml |accessdate=June 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610071033/http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/971114/safrica.shtml |archivedate=June 10, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; to a family of [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish descents]]. He was the eldest of four siblings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Formicola|first=Jo Renee|title=Religious Leaders and Faith-based Politics: Ten Profiles|last2=Morken|first2=Hubert|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2001|isbn=0847699633|location=|pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, A.&amp;nbsp;H. Lapin, was the nephew of [[Elyah Lopian|Rabbi Elya Lopian]] (1872–1970), and served as a prominent and outspoken [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbi in Johannesburg and [[Cape Town]]. His father eventually established an Orthodox synagogue (''Am Echad'') in [[San Jose, California]], after leaving South Africa in the 1970s. Lapin [[emigration|emigrated]] with his family from South Africa to the United States in the 1970s, and became a [[Naturalization|naturalized]] United States citizen in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Interim |title=Q and A with: Rabbi Daniel Lapin |url=http://www.theinterim.com/2006/oct/14QandA.html |accessdate=June 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104190534/http://www.theinterim.com/2006/oct/14QandA.html |archivedate=January 4, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to coming to the United States, he studied in [[Yeshiva College of South Africa|Yeshivas]] in [[Gateshead]] and [[Jerusalem]]. Lapin has rabbinic ordination from three institutions: Gateshead Yeshiva (1969); Yeshiva Knesset Hezekiah in Israel (1972); and from Rabbi Jacob Ruderman in Baltimore, Maryland (1975).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While in his early twenties he returned to South Africa and taught physics and Bible in [[Yeshiva College of South Africa]]. In order to finance his planned move to Israel, Lapin formed a company, "Lapin Marine Enterprises" to manufacture boats. When he made enough money to finance his plans, he sold the company and went to New York in 1973, planning to stay one month in the US and then move to Israel. Lapin had a change of heart, and instead of moving to Israel, he partnered with [[Matis Weinberg|Rabbi Matis Weinberg]], the son of a prominent rabbi in Baltimore, and started a yeshiva for high school and post-high school students in California, Kerem College, in [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]], in 1976.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

His family re-located to Washington State in 1991 to develop Toward Tradition, and to host a nationally syndicated weekly radio show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Catholic Education Resource Center | title=A Rabbi's Warning To U.S. Christians | url=http://catholiceducation.org/articles/persecution/pch0135.htm |accessdate = June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lapin has two brothers, [[David Lapin|David]] and [[Raphael Lapin|Raphael]], who are also Orthodox rabbis and have similar educational backgrounds. His sister is married to an American rabbi. Lapin's wife and business partner, Susan Lapin, is also an author and lecturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Jewish World Reviews | title=Opening The Book on Hate | url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/1100/closing.book.html |accessdate = June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional career ==

=== Pacific Jewish Center ===
From 1976 until 1991 Lapin was the rabbi of the Pacific Jewish Center in Venice, California.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During those years Lapin and [[Michael Medved]] helped to revitalize&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the synagogue, which viewed itself as functioning as part of the recent [[Baal teshuva]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pacific Jewish Center |title=About Us |url=http://www.pjcenter.com/aboutus.htm |accessdate=June 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614022731/http://www.pjcenter.com/aboutus.htm |archivedate=June 14, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center is known for its outreach to unaffiliated and disconnected Jews, and the Shul remains the last of the synagogues built in Venice during the first part of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Prayer Shawls, Flip-Flops Mingle at 'Shul on the Beach', by Rebecca Spence, Forward, September 26, 2007 [http://www.forward.com/articles/11708/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Religion and Prime Time Television

== Religious and political views ==

=== Conservative Christians v. Jewish liberalism ===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2014}}
Lapin promotes conservative political principles, intermixed with traditional religious observance. Lapin was one of the Jewish voices in support of [[Mel Gibson]]'s controversial film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', and was a strong supporter of the efforts by [[Terri Schiavo case|Terri Schiavo]]'s parents to keep their daughter alive. He is also a strong supporter of [[Pope Pius XII]] as a [[Righteous Among the Nations|righteous gentile]], a term he believes should be renamed "righteous Christian". Lapin has called the United States the most "Jewish-friendly" state in history because of its Christian heritage. He argues that it is better for Jews to promote shared [[Judeo-Christian]] values with the majority than promote solely Jewish values. He has also called [[secular liberalism]] a danger to Judeo-Christian values, and claimed that the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|Holocaust Memorial Museum]] presents [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]] propaganda; he says that the museum ignores, for example, the work of [[Corrie ten Boom]]'s family in unconditionally saving Jews during [[World War II]]. Lapin has declared that the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and its allies are "dangerous organizations that are driving a wedge between [[American Jews]] and Christians". Referring to ADL national director [[Abraham Foxman]], Lapin claimed that by calling ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]], "what he is saying is that the only way (for Christians) to escape the wrath of Foxman is to repudiate (their own) faith". Lapin also rejects the idea that the [[Jewish left]] represents Judaism. He has excoriated Jewish liberals for their promotion of ideas he views as contrary to traditional Judaism, such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and socialism. He argues that Jewish-born liberals have redefined "Judaism" to mean "liberalism" - and redefined "anti-liberalism" as "anti-Semitism". Lapin has said: "It is time for us to recognize the charge of anti-Semitism for what it often is: a political weapon intended to silence critics of liberalism."

=== Public celebration of Christmas ===
Lapin has spoken against the [[Christmas controversy|secularization of Christmas]], saying that, "We see obsequious regard for faiths like Judaism and even [[Islam]], while Christianity is treated with contempt". He is opposed to replacing the "Merry Christmas" greeting with "Happy Holidays", saying, "Let us all go out of our way to wish our many wonderful Christian friends a very merry Christmas&amp;nbsp;... Nationwide, Christmas [[Nativity scene]]s are banned from city halls and shopping malls, but [[Hanukkah|Chanukah]] menorahs are permitted."&lt;ref&gt;Lapin, Daniel (November 24, 2005) [http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles5/LapinChristmas.php Merry Christmas is Not Offensive – Jews Should Protect Religious Freedom for Everyone.] ''Orthodoxy Today '' Retrieved 2009-12-22&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wealth ===
Lapin asks: "Does God want people to be rich?" ... "Yes!", he says, because God "wants us to be obsessively preoccupied by one another's needs", a habit that the commerce relationship fosters. "Wealth is a consequence of doing the right thing", he says. He argues that the [[Torah]] supports the [[free market]] and opposes punitive taxation, and wants people to pass on assets to their descendants, rather than being taken by the government by [[inheritance tax]]es.

== Links to Jack Abramoff ==
Lapin has been linked to the scandal of [[Jack Abramoff]] through his organization Toward Tradition. From the early 1990s until 2004, Abramoff was a board member of the organization, which required its board members to contribute at least $10,000 per year to the organization, and served a few terms as Chairman of the Board. Abramoff met his contribution one year by donating $10,000 from the [[Capital Athletic Foundation]], an organization Abramoff controlled. E-mails later surfaced that were alleged to have been sent between Lapin and Abramoff. In these e-mails, Abramoff requests that Lapin create fake awards for [[Talmud]]ic studies to help Abramoff gain admittance to the [[Cosmos Club]] in Washington, D. C. Lapin later released a formal statement denying having given any awards to Abramoff, and stated that he was joking in the e-mails and believed that Abramoff was as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=The Seattle Times | title=Abramoff Used Area Foundation As A Conduit For Money | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002728644_lapin09m.html | accessdate=June 16, 2012 | date=January 9, 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630225805/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002728644_lapin09m.html | archivedate=June 30, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curtius, Mary.
