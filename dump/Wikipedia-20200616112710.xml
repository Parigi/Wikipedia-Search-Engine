The '''App Store''' is a [[digital distribution]] platform, developed and maintained by [[Apple Inc.]], for [[mobile app]]s on its [[iOS]] operating system. The store allows users to browse and download apps developed with Apple's [[iOS SDK|iOS software development kit]]. Apps can be downloaded on the [[iPhone]] smartphone, the [[iPod Touch]] handheld computer, or the [[iPad]] tablet computer, and some can be transferred to the [[Apple Watch]] smartwatch or 4th-generation or newer [[Apple TV]]s as extensions of iPhone apps.

The App Store was opened on July 10, 2008, with an initial 500 applications available. {{As of|2017|}}, the store features over 2.2 million apps.

Developers have multiple options for monetizing their applications, ranging from free, free with in-app purchases, and paid. However, App Store has been criticized for a lackluster development environment, prompting the company in June 2016 to announce a "renewed focus and energy" on the store. Major changes introduced in the following months include ads in search results, a new app subscription model, and the ability for developers to respond to customer reviews. Additionally, Apple began a process to remove old apps that do not function as intended or that don't follow current app guidelines, with app research firms noticing significant numbers of app removals from the store. Furthermore, with the release of [[iOS 11]] in September 2017, App Store received a complete design overhaul, bringing a greater focus on editorial content and daily highlights, as well as a design similar in style to several of Apple's built-in iOS apps.

After the success of Apple's App Store and the launch of [[list of mobile software distribution platforms|similar services]] by its competitors, the term "app store" has been adopted to refer to any similar service for mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sinead |last=Carew |title=In app store war, BlackBerry, Google hold own |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-column-pluggedin-idUSTRE53L5DK20090422 |website=[[Reuters]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |date=April 22, 2009 |accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Roy |last=Furchgott |title=Nokia’s App Store Launches With a Hiccup |url=https://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/nokias-app-store-launches-with-a-hiccup/ |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 29, 2009 |accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Priya |last=Ganapati |title=BlackBerry App Store Gets a Name |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/03/blackberry-app/ |website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=March 4, 2009 |accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Apple applied for a U.S. [[trademark]] on the term "App Store" in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Larry |last=Dignan |title=Apple's App Store and a little trademark history |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-app-store-and-a-little-trademark-history/ |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=March 22, 2011 |accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was tentatively approved in early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Pachal |title=How Apple Can Trademark 'App Store' |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2382968,00.asp |website=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=April 1, 2011 |accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, U.S. District Judge [[Phyllis Hamilton]], who was presiding over Apple's case against [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], said she would "probably" deny Apple's motion to stop Amazon from using the "App Store" name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Lowensohn |title=Judge likely to deny Apple's 'Appstore' complaint |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/judge-likely-to-deny-apples-appstore-complaint/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=June 22, 2011 |accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Joel |last1=Rosenblatt |first2=Karen |last2=Gullo |title=Apple Bid to Bar Amazon ‘Appstore’ Will ‘Likely’ Be Denied |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-06-22/apple-bid-to-bar-amazon-appstore-will-likely-be-denied.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624211650/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-06-22/apple-bid-to-bar-amazon-appstore-will-likely-be-denied.html |website=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=June 22, 2011 |archivedate=June 24, 2011 |accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Dan |last1=Levine |first2=Poornima |last2=Gupta |title=Apple may have tough road in Amazon lawsuit |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-amazon-idUSTRE75L79Y20110622 |website=[[Reuters]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |date=June 22, 2011 |accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, Apple was denied preliminary injunction against [[Amazon Appstore|Amazon's Appstore]] by a federal judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Foresman |title=Apple denied preliminary injunction against Amazon’s "Appstore" |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/07/apples-preliminary-injunction-against-amazons-appstore-denied/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=July 7, 2011 |accessdate=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''app'' has become a popular [[buzzword]]; in January 2011, ''app'' was awarded the honor of being 2010's "Word of the Year" by the [[American Dialect Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=“App” voted 2010 word of the year by the American Dialect Society (UPDATED) |url=http://www.americandialect.org/app-voted-2010-word-of-the-year-by-the-american-dialect-society-updated |publisher=[[American Dialect Society]] |date=January 7, 2011 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Cody |last=Fink |title=App Is 2010’s Word Of The Year |url=https://www.macstories.net/news/app-is-2010s-word-of-the-year/ |website=MacStories |date=January 13, 2011 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "App" has been used as shorthand for "[[Application software|application]]" since at least the mid-1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oracle gets NC religion |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/oracle-gets-nc-religion/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=February 27, 1996 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in product names since at least 2006, for example [[G Suite|then-named Google Apps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google Launches Hosted Communications Services |url=http://googlepress.blogspot.no/2006/08/google-launches-hosted-communications_28.html |website=News from Google |publisher=[[Google]] |date=August 28, 2006 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple announced [[Mac App Store]], a similar app distribution platform for its [[macOS]] personal computer operating system, in October 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ina |last=Fried |title=Apple unveils new MacBook Airs, previews Lion |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-unveils-new-macbook-airs-previews-lion/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=October 20, 2010 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ross |last=Miller |title=Mac App Store for OS X 10.6 and 10.7 unveiled, coming 'within 90 days' |url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/10/20/app-store-for-os-x-unveiled/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 20, 2010 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the official launch taking place in January 2011 with the release of its [[Mac OS X Snow Leopard|10.6.6 "Snow Leopard"]] update.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Mac App Store: What you need to know |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1156962/software/mac-app-store-faq.html |website=[[Macworld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=January 6, 2011 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple’s Mac App Store Opens for Business |url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/01/06Apples-Mac-App-Store-Opens-for-Business.html |website=Apple Press Info |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |date=January 6, 2011 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Apple informed developers that they could begin using appstore.com for links to their apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Owen |last=Thomas |title=Apple Does Not Want You To Visit Appstore.com |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-appstore-message-2013-2 |website=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]] |date=February 4, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Apple Debuts New AppStore.com Vanity URLs For Developers During Super Bowl |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/03/apple-debuts-new-vanity-urls-for-app-store-developers-during-super-bowl-domain-name-land-grab-to-follow/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=February 3, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Foresman |title=Apple debuts new AppStore.com URLs during Super Bowl 47 |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/02/apple-debuts-new-appstore-com-urls-during-super-bowl-47/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=February 4, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June at its [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|developer conference]], Apple announced an upcoming "Kids" section in App Store, a new section featuring apps categorized by age range, and the section was launched alongside the release of [[iOS 7]] in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Introducing Apple’s New "Kids" App Store |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/22/introducing-apples-new-kids-app-store/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=September 22, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Guarino |title=App Store makes it easier for parents to find apps for their children with new Kids Category in iOS 7 |url=https://9to5mac.com/2013/09/19/app-store-makes-it-easier-for-parents-to-find-apps-for-their-children-with-new-kids-category-in-ios-7/ |website=9to5Mac |date=September 19, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, due to pressure from the [[European Commission]], Apple updated App Store so that all apps that have no charge to download are labeled "Get" instead of the previous "Free", due to many "free" apps' inclusions of paid [[Microtransaction|in-app purchases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Apple Relabels "Free" Download Buttons On iTunes And Mac App Store To "Get" Following Pressure from EC |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/19/apple-relabels-free-download-buttons-on-itunes-and-mac-app-store-to-get-following-pressure-from-ec/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=November 19, 2014 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Replaces 'Free' Purchase Button Labeling With 'Get' in App Store |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2014/11/19/apple-replaces-free-button-with-get/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=November 19, 2014 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Matt |last=Brian |title=Why App Store apps are now labeled 'Get' instead of 'Free' |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/20/apple-switches-free-get-app-store/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=November 20, 2014 |accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, reports surfaced that documentation for a new [[beta test|beta]] for the then-upcoming release of [[IOS 10#10.3|iOS 10.3]] detailed that Apple would let developers respond to customer reviews in the App Store, marking a significant change from the previous limitation, which prevented developers from communicating with users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Apple will finally let developers respond to App Store reviews |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/apple-will-finally-let-developers-respond-to-app-store-reviews/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=January 24, 2017 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Benjamin |last=Mayo |title=Apple will let developers reply to reviews in the App Store soon, for iOS and Mac apps |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/01/24/apple-will-let-developers-reply-to-reviews-in-the-app-store-soon-for-ios-and-mac-apps/ |website=9to5Mac |date=January 24, 2017 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The functionality was officially enabled on March 27, 2017 when iOS 10.3 was released to users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Releases iOS 10.3 With Find My AirPods, APFS, App Store Review Tweaks and More |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/03/27/apple-releases-ios-10-3/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=March 27, 2017 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further details were also released about reviews for users, including that they will be able to rate and review apps in the apps themselves rather than being redirected to the App Store, and that they can mark other users' reviews as "Helpful" or "Not Helpful".&lt;ref name="TechCrunch app reviews"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Developers can finally respond to App Store reviews – here’s how it works |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/developers-can-finally-respond-to-app-store-reviews-heres-how-it-works/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=March 28, 2017 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple published a document describing proper ways to respond for developers, including being timely, clear and concise, prioritize certain forms of reviews (low-star ratings, certain countries or recent reviews) through filtering in [[iTunes Connect]], and that developer responses go through an approval process before being published.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch app reviews"/&gt; Developers are also forbidden from manipulating or incenting feedback.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch app reviews"/&gt; Developer responses are listed in the App Store as a line underneath the respective user's review,&lt;ref name="TechCrunch app reviews"/&gt; and users receive a notification/email upon a response from the respective developer, with the option to update their review.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch app reviews"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chance |last=Miller |title=Apple details new App Store ratings and review responses on iOS 10.3 for developers |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/03/27/apple-details-new-app-store-ratings-and-review-responses-on-ios-10-3-for-developers/ |website=9to5Mac |date=March 27, 2017 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, App Store submissions containing pricing details, such as "free", in the name started getting rejected. Developers had previously been advised in developer guides in [[iTunes Connect]] and App Store overview pages that they should refrain from the practice, though apps were still approved.

"Search Ads Advanced" is a new name given to the older method, in which developers have to pay whenever users tap on their apps in search results, along with unlimited monthly budgets.

Apple also offers an iTunes Affiliate Program, which lets people refer others to apps and other iTunes content, along with in-app purchases, for a percentage of sales. The commission rate for in-app purchases was reduced from 7% to 2.5% in May 2017, while affiliate rates for paid apps, music, movies, books, and TV shows remained at 7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple confirms reduced App Store affiliate commission rates apply to in-app purchases |url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/05/08/apple-confirms-reduced-app-store-affiliate-commission-rates-apply-to-in-app-purchases |website=AppleInsider |date=May 8, 2017 |accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chance |last=Miller |title=Apple clarifies iTunes affiliate changes: apps stay at 7% &amp; in-app purchases fall to 2.5% |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/05/07/apple-clarifies-itunes-affiliate-changes-apps-stay-at-7-in-app-purchases-fall-to-2-5/ |website=9to5Mac |date=May 7, 2017 |accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

App Store received a major design overhaul with the release of [[iOS 11]].

Prior to September 2017, Apple offered a way for users to manage their iOS app purchases through the [[iTunes]] computer software. In September, version 12.7 of iTunes was released, removing the App Store section in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Welch |title=Apple starts cutting the bloat from iTunes by removing iOS App Store |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16298988/apple-itunes-desktop-update-removes-app-store |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=September 12, 2017 |accessdate=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jake |last=Smith |title=Apple's iTunes removes iOS App Store from desktop version |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-removes-ios-app-store-from-desktop-versions-of-itunes/ |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=September 13, 2017 |accessdate=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the following month, iTunes 12.6.3 was also released, retaining the App Store, with ''9to5Mac'' noting that the secondary release was positioned by Apple as "necessary for some businesses performing internal app deployments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Benjamin |last=Mayo |title=Apple still offers an iTunes version with App Store, Ringtones and other features removed in ‘focused’ iTunes 12.7 |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/10/09/apple-itunes-apps-focused-removed-stopgap/ |website=9to5Mac |date=October 9, 2017 |accessdate=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tim |last=Hardwick |title=Apple Quietly Releases iTunes 12.6.3 With Built-In App Store |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/10/09/apple-itunes-with-app-store-included/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=October 9, 2017 |accessdate=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 4, 2018, Apple announced that the App Store had a record-breaking holiday season according to a new press release. During the week starting on Christmas Eve, a record number of customers made App Store purchases, spending more than $890 million in that seven-day period. On New Year's Day 2018 alone, customers made $300 million in purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/01/app-store-kicks-off-2018-with-record-breaking-holiday-season/|title=App Store kicks off 2018 with record-breaking holiday season|work=Apple Newsroom|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and monetization==
===iOS SDK===
{{Main|iOS SDK}} 
The iOS SDK ([[Software Development Kit]]) allows for the development of [[mobile app]]s on iOS.

While originally developing [[iPhone]] prior to its unveiling in 2007, Apple's then-[[CEO]] [[Steve Jobs]] did not intend to let third-party developers build native apps for iOS, instead directing them to make [[web application]]s for the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari web browser]].&lt;ref name="No native apps"&gt;{{cite web |title=Jobs’ original vision for the iPhone: No third-party native apps |url=https://9to5mac.com/2011/10/21/jobs-original-vision-for-the-iphone-no-third-party-native-apps/ |website=9to5Mac |date=October 21, 2011 |accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, backlash from developers prompted the company to reconsider,&lt;ref name="No native apps" /&gt; with Jobs announcing in October 2007 that Apple would have a software development kit available for developers by February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Geoff |last=Duncan |title=Apple confirms iPhone SDK coming next year |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/apple/apple-confirms-iphone-sdk-coming-next-year/ |website=[[Digital Trends]] |date=October 17, 2007 |accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Steve Jobs confirms native iPhone SDK by February |url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/07/10/17/steve_jobs_confirms_native_iphone_sdk_by_february |website=AppleInsider |date=October 17, 2007 |accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SDK was released on March 6, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jim |last=Dalrymple |title=Apple unveils iPhone SDK |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1132400/iphonesdk.html |website=[[Macworld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=March 6, 2008 |accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Block |authorlink=Ryan Block |title=Live from Apple's iPhone SDK press conference |url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/03/06/live-from-apples-iphone-press-conference/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=March 6, 2008 |accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combined with [[Xcode]], the iOS SDK helps developers write iOS apps using officially supported programming languages, including [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]] and [[Objective-C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Adam |last=Sinicki |title=Developing for Android vs developing for iOS – in 5 rounds |url=http://www.androidauthority.com/developing-for-android-vs-ios-697304/ |website=Android Authority |date=June 9, 2016 |accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies have also created tools that allow for the development of native iOS apps using their respective programming languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Paul |title=MonoTouch drops .NET into Apple’s walled app garden |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2009/09/monotouch-drops-net-into-apples-walled-app-garden/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=September 15, 2009 |accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jackie |last=Dove |title=Adobe unleashes Creative Suite 5 |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1150522/cs5launch.html |website=[[Macworld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=April 11, 2010 |accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To publish apps on App Store, developers must pay a $99 yearly fee for access to Apple's Developer Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tim |last=Mackenzie |title=App store fees, percentages, and payouts: What developers need to know |url=https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/software-engineer/app-store-fees-percentages-and-payouts-what-developers-need-to-know/ |website=[[TechRepublic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=May 7, 2012 |accessdate=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Blair Henry |last=Frank |title=Apple frees casual iOS developers of membership requirement |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2933052/apple-frees-casual-ios-developers-of-membership-requirement.html |website=[[PC World]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=June 8, 2015 |accessdate=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple has announced that, in the United States in 2018, it will waive the fee for nonprofit organizations and governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dieter |last=Bohn |title=Apple will waive developer fees for nonprofits and governments in 2018 |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/20/16804010/apple-waive-developer-fees-nonprofits-governments-2018 |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=December 20, 2017 |accessdate=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tc-templates" /&gt;

Developers have a few options for monetizing their applications. The "Free Model" enables free apps, increasing likelihood of engagement. The "Freemium Model" makes the app download free, but users are offered optional additional features in-app that require payments. The "Subscription Model" enables ongoing monetization through renewable transactions. The "Paid Model" makes the app itself a paid download and offers no additional features. The "Paymium Model" enables paid app downloads and paid in-app content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Choosing a Business Model |url=https://developer.apple.com/app-store/business-models/ |website=Apple Developer |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In-app subscriptions were originally introduced for magazines, newspapers and music apps in February 2011, giving developers 70% of revenue earned and Apple 30%. Publishers could also sell digital subscriptions through their website, bypassing Apple's fees, but were not allowed to advertise their website alternative through the apps themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Halliday |title=Apple launches subscription service for magazines, newspapers and music |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/feb/15/apple-subscription-service-app-store |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=February 15, 2011 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Chartier |title=Apple launches long-awaited subscriptions for App Store |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1157927/app_store_subscriptions.html |website=[[Macworld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=February 15, 2011 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, multiple media outlets reported that apps had decreased significantly in popularity.

In an interview with ''The Verge'' in June 2016, [[Phil Schiller]], Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, said that Apple had a "renewed focus and energy" on the App Store, and announced multiple significant changes, including advertisements in search results and a new app subscription model. The subscription model saw the firmly established 70/30 revenue split between developers and Apple change into a new 85/15 revenue split if a user stays subscribed to the developer's app for a year, and opens the possibility of subscriptions to all apps, not just select categories.&lt;ref name="verge changes"&gt;{{cite web |first=Lauren |last=Goode |title=App Store 2.0 |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/8/11880730/apple-app-store-subscription-update-phil-schiller-interview |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 8, 2016 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Announces Major App Store Changes Including New Subscription Terms and Search Ads |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2016/06/08/apple-major-app-store-changes/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=June 8, 2016 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

App data and insights analyst company App Annie released a report in October 2016, announcing that China had overtaken the United States as Apple's biggest market in App Store revenue.

==Number of iOS applications==
On July 10, 2008, Apple's then-CEO [[Steve Jobs]] told ''[[USA Today]]'' that App Store contained 500 third-party applications for the iPhone and the iPod Touch, and of these 25&amp;nbsp;percent were free.&lt;ref name="Launching with 500"/&gt; Ten million applications were downloaded the first weekend.&lt;ref name="First weekend"/&gt; By September, the number of available apps had increased to 3,000, with over 100 million downloads.&lt;ref name="September 2008 apps"/&gt;

==Application ratings==
Apple rates applications worldwide based on their content, and determines the age group for which each is appropriate. According to the [[iOS version history|iPhone OS 3.0]] launch event, the iPhone will allow blocking of objectionable apps in the iPhone's settings. The following are the ratings that Apple has detailed:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Rating
! Description
|-
| style="background:green; color:white;"|'''4+'''
| Contains no objectionable material.&lt;ref name="age-ratings-story"&gt;{{cite web |title=Age Ratings : App Store Story |url=https://apps.apple.com/sa/story/id1440847896?l=en |website=App Store|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |accessdate=29 May 2020 |language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rating has three sub-classifications:
* Made for Ages 5 and Under - This app is suitable for children aged 5 and under, but people aged 6 and over can also use this app.
* Made for Ages 6 to 8 - This app is suitable for children aged 6 to 8, but people aged 9 and over can also use this app.

|-

|-
|style="background:black; color:red;" |'''No Rating'''
| These apps cannot be purchased on the App Store.
|}

==App approval process==
{{Main|Approval of iOS apps}}
Applications are subject to approval by Apple, as outlined in the SDK agreement, for basic reliability testing and other analysis. Applications may still be distributed "ad-hoc" if they are rejected, by the author manually submitting a request to Apple to license the application to individual iPhones, although Apple may withdraw the ability for authors to do this at a later date.

{{As of|2013}}, Apple employed mostly [[static program analysis|static analysis]] for their app review process, which means that dynamic code reassembly techniques could defeat the review process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox |first=John |url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2013/081913-jekyll-test-attack-sneaks-through-272947.html |title="Jekyll" test attack sneaks through Apple App Store, wreaks havoc on iOS |publisher=Network World |date=August 18, 2013 |accessdate=June 20, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102195850/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2013/081913-jekyll-test-attack-sneaks-through-272947.html |archivedate=January 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Talbot |first=David |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/518096/remotely-assembled-malware-blows-past-apples-screening-process/ |title=Remotely Assembled Malware Blows Past Apple’s Screening Process &amp;#124; MIT Technology Review |publisher=Technologyreview.com |date=August 15, 2013 |accessdate=June 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Apple updated its App Store review guidelines to specify that app developers will no longer have the ability to use custom prompts for encouraging users to leave reviews for their apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Benjamin |last=Mayo |title=App Store now requires developers to use official API to request app ratings, disallows custom prompts |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/06/09/app-rating-custom-prompts-app-store-banned/ |website=9to5Mac |date=June 9, 2017 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jacob |last=Kastrenakes |title=Apple won’t let apps annoy you with their own review prompts anymore |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/9/15768196/apple-ending-annoying-app-store-review-prompts |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 9, 2017 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the release of [[iOS 11]] in late 2017, Apple will also let developers choose whether to keep current app reviews when updating their apps or to reset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Romain |last=Dillet |title=The new iOS App Store lets devs choose whether or not to reset ratings when updating |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/07/ios-app-developers-will-be-able-to-keep-app-store-ratings-when-releasing-an-update/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 7, 2017 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, another update to App Store policies allows users to optionally "tip" content creators, by voluntarily sending them money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Apple legalizes and taxes in-app tipping for content creators |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/09/in-app-tips/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 9, 2017 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Rossignol |title=Apple Officially Allows Users to Tip Content Creators With In-App Purchases |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/09/apple-officially-allows-in-app-tipping/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=June 9, 2017 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, apps must be notarized as of macOS 10.15, indicating the Mac App Store is starting to further resemble the iOS App Store.

==Controversial apps==
In November 2012, [[Boyfriend Maker]], a [[dating sim]] game, was removed due to "reports of references to violent sexual acts and paedophilia" deemed inappropriate to Boyfriend Maker's age rating of 4+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Emily |last=Gera |title=Boyfriend Maker gets pulled from App Store for references to paedophilia |url=https://www.polygon.com/2012/11/26/3692230/boyfriend-maker-gets-pulled-from-app-store-for-references-to |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=November 26, 2012 |accessdate=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revised version called Boyfriend Plus was approved by Apple in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kirk |last=Hamilton |title=Bizarre Boyfriend Maker Is Back On The App Store, Slightly Declawed |url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2013/04/bizarre-boyfriend-maker-is-back-on-the-app-store-slightly-declawed/ |website=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Univision Communications]] |date=April 24, 2013 |accessdate=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, HiddenApps was approved and appeared in App Store.

In September 2015, it was discovered that "hundreds" of apps submitted and approved on App Store were using [[XcodeGhost]], a [[Malware|malicious]] version of the [[Xcode]] development software.

In June 2017, a [[scam]]ming trend was discovered on the store, in which developers make apps built on non-existent services, attach in-app purchase subscriptions to the opening dialogue, then buy App Store search advertising space to get the app into the higher rankings. In one instance, an app by the name of "Mobile protection :Clean &amp; Security VPN" would require payments of $99.99 for a seven-day subscription after a short trial.

In addition, Apple has removed software licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) from App Store, due to text in Apple's Terms of Service agreement imposing [[digital rights management]] and proprietary legal terms incompatible with the terms of the GPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/more-about-the-app-store-gpl-enforcement |title=More about the App Store GPL Enforcement |first=Brett |last=Smith |website=[[Free Software Foundation]] |date=May 26, 2010 |accessdate=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Murphy |title=Apple Pulls VLC Player from App Store Due to GPL |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2375476,00.asp |website=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=January 8, 2011 |accessdate=July 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Large-scale app removals===
On September 1, 2016, Apple announced that starting September 7, it would be removing old apps that do not function as intended or that don't follow current review guidelines. Developers will be warned and given 30 days to update their apps, but apps that crash on startup will be removed immediately. Additionally, the app names registered by developers cannot exceed 50 characters, in an attempt to stop developers from inserting long descriptions or irrelevant terms in app names to improve the app's ranking in App Store search results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Juli Clover |title=Apple to Clean Up App Store, Eliminate Outdated and Non-Functional Apps |url=http://www.macrumors.com/2016/09/01/apple-cleaning-up-app-store/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=September 1, 2016 |accessdate=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Chris Welch |title=Apple will start removing abandoned apps from the App Store this month |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/1/12755260/apple-removing-abandoned-iphone-apps |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=September 1, 2016 |accessdate=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; App intelligence firm Sensor Tower revealed in November 2016 that Apple, as promised from its September announcement of removing old apps, had removed 47,300 apps from App Store in October 2016, a 238 percent increase of its prior number of average monthly app removals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Apple’s big App Store purge is now underway |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/15/apples-big-app-store-purge-is-now-underway/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=November 15, 2016 |accessdate=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Removed 47,300 Outdated iOS Apps From App Store in October of 2016 |url=http://www.macrumors.com/2016/11/15/apple-app-store-purge-october-2016/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=November 15, 2016 |accessdate=November 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, ''[[TechCrunch]]'' reported that Apple had turned its app removal focus on apps copying functionality from other, popular apps. An example cited included "if a popular game like ''[[Flappy Bird]]'' or ''Red Ball'' hits the charts, there will be hundreds or thousands of clones within weeks that attempt to capitalize on the initial wave of popularity". The report also noted removals of music apps serving [[pirated]] tracks. The publication wrote that, since the initial September app removals began, Apple had removed "multiple hundreds of thousands" of apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Panzarino |title=Apple goes after clones and spam on the App Store |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/apple-goes-after-clones-and-spam-on-the-app-store/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 21, 2017 |accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chance |last=Miller |title=Apple ramping up App Store cleaning efforts, has already removed ‘hundreds of thousands’ of apps |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/06/21/apple-ramping-up-app-store-cleaning-efforts-has-already-removed-hundreds-of-thousands-of-apps/ |website=9to5Mac |date=June 21, 2017 |accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, a new report from ''TechCrunch'' stated that Apple had begun enforcing new restrictions on the use of "commercialized template or app generation services". Originally introduced as part of Apple's [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|2017 developer conference]], new App Store guidelines allow the company to ban apps making use of templates or commercial app services. This affected many small businesses, with ''TechCrunch''{{'}}s report citing that "local retailers, restaurants, small fitness studios, nonprofits, churches and other organizations" benefit from using templates or app services due to minimal costs. Developers had received notice from Apple with a January 1, 2018 deadline to change their respective apps. The news caught the attention of Congress, with Congressman [[Ted Lieu]] writing a letter to Apple at the beginning of December, asking it to reconsider, writing that "It is my understanding that many small businesses, research organizations, and religious institutions rely on template apps when they do not possess the resources to develop apps in-house", and that the new rules cast "too wide a net", specifically "invalidating apps from longstanding and legitimate developers who pose no threat to the App Store’s integrity". Additionally, the news of stricter enforcement caused significant criticism from app development firms; one company told ''TechCrunch'' that it chose to close down its business following the news, saying that "The 4.2.6 [rule enforcement] was just a final drop that made us move on a bit faster with that decision [to close]", and another company told the publication that "There was no way in June [when the guidelines changed] that we would have said, ‘that’s going to target our apps' ... Apple had told us you aren’t being targeted by this from a quality standpoint. So being hit now under the umbrella of spam is shocking to every quality developer out there and all the good actors". Furthermore, the latter company stated that "there’s only so much you can do with apps that perform the same utility – ordering food". A third company said that "Rule 4.2.6 is a concrete illustration of the danger of Apple’s dominant position", and a fourth said that "They’ve wiped out pretty much an entire industry. Not just DIY tools like AppMakr, but also development suites like Titanium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Apple’s widened ban on templated apps is wiping small businesses from the App Store |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/apples-widened-ban-on-templated-apps-is-wiping-small-businesses-from-the-app-store/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[Oath Inc.]] |date=December 8, 2017 |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chance |last=Miller |title=Report: Apple cracking down on template applications, giving developers January 1 deadline |url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/12/08/app-store-template-applications/ |website=9to5Mac |date=December 8, 2017 |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the year, Apple updated the guideline to clarify that companies and organizations are allowed to use template apps, but only as long as they directly publish their app on their own; it remained a violation of the rule for commercial app services to publish apps for the respective clients.&lt;ref name="tc-templates"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Apple revises its controversial guidelines on template-based apps |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/20/apple-revises-its-controversial-guidelines-on-template-based-apps/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[Oath Inc.]] |date=December 20, 2017 |accessdate=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Updates App Store Guidelines to Relax Restrictive Rules on Template Apps |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/20/app-store-guidelines-updated-template-apps/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=December 20, 2017 |accessdate=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Censorship by the Chinese government ===
In January 2017, Apple complied with a request from the Chinese government to remove the Chinese version of ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} app. This followed the government's efforts in 2012 to block the ''Times''{{'}} website after stories of hidden wealth among family members of then-leader of China, [[Wen Jiabao]], were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Vincent |title=Apple removes New York Times app from China’s app store at government’s request |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/5/14175556/new-york-times-china-app-removed-apple |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=January 5, 2017 |accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement, an Apple spokesperson told the media that "we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations", though would not specify which regulations, and added that "As a result the app must be taken down off the China app store.

Following Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]]'s appearance at China's [[World Internet Conference]] in December 2017, in which Cook stated that Apple and China share a vision of "developing a digital economy for openness and shared benefits", free speech and human rights activists criticized Cook and the company. Maya Wang at [[Human Rights Watch]] told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that "Cook’s appearance lends credibility to a state that aggressively censors the internet, throws people in jail for being critical about social ills, and is building artificial intelligence systems that monitors everyone and targets dissent. ... The version of cyberspace the Chinese government is building is a decidedly dystopian one, and I don’t think anyone would want to share in this ‘common future.’ Apple should have spoken out against it, not endorsed it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Simon |last=Denyer |title=Apple CEO backs China’s vision of an ‘open’ Internet as censorship reaches new heights |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/12/04/apple-ceo-backs-chinas-vision-of-an-open-internet-as-censorship-reaches-new-heights/ |website=[[The Washington Post]] |date=December 4, 2017 |accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy told ''[[CNBC]]'' that "American tech companies have become leading champions of free expression.
