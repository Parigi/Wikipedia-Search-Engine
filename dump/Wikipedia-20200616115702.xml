[[File:IBM Electronic Data Processing Machine (9467782802).jpg|thumb|Two programmers working on an [[IBM 704]] at [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]], 1954]]
A '''computer programmer''', sometimes called only '''programmer''' or more recently a '''coder''' (especially in more informal contexts), is a person who creates [[computer software]]. The term ''computer programmer'' can refer to a specialist in one area of [[computers]], or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software.

A programmer's most oft-used [[computer language]] (e.g., [[Assembly language|Assembly]], [[COBOL]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[JavaScript (programming language)|JavaScript]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Python programming language|Python]]) may be prefixed to the term ''programmer''. Some who work with [[World Wide Web|web]] programming languages also prefix their titles with ''web''.

A range of occupations that involve programming also often require a range of other, similar skills, for example: (software) developer, [[web developer]], [[mobile applications]] developer, embedded [[firmware]] developer, [[software engineer]], [[computer scientist]], [[game programmer]], [[Video game developer|game developer]] and [[software analyst]]. The use of the term ''programmer'' as applied to these positions is sometimes considered an insulting simplification or even derogatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No Programmers |url=http://www.ericsink.com/No_Programmers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Developer versus programmer |url=http://codebetter.com/blogs/raymond.lewallen/archive/2005/02/22/55812.aspx |access-date=21 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125071809/http://codebetter.com/blogs/raymond.lewallen/archive/2005/02/22/55812.aspx |archive-date=25 November 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Developers AND Programmers |url=http://weblogs.asp.net/miked/archive/2006/10/13/_2200_Developers_2200_-and-_2200_Programmers_2200_.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Programmer vs. Developer vs. Software Engineer |url=http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.112837.37 |access-date=21 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710101939/http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.112837.37# |archive-date=10 July 2018 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Programmer vs. Developer vs. Software Engineer |url=http://www.xtremevbtalk.com/archive/index.php/t-233780.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Ada Lovelace portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Ada Lovelace]] is considered by many to be the first computer programmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=J.|last=Fuegi|first2=J.|last2=Francis|title=Lovelace &amp; Babbage and the creation of the 1843 'notes'|journal=Annals of the History of Computing|volume=25|issue=4 |year=2003|pages=18–26|doi=10.1109/MAHC.2003.1253887}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
British [[count]]ess and mathematician [[Ada Lovelace]] is often considered to be the first computer programmer, as she was the first to publish part of a program (specifically an [[algorithm]]) intended for implementation on [[Charles Babbage]]'s [[analytical engine]], in October 1842. The algorithm was used to calculate [[Bernoulli number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fuegi |first=J. |last2=Francis |first2=J. |date=October–December 2003 |title=Lovelace &amp; babbage and the creation of the 1843 'notes' |journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=16–26 |doi=10.1109/MAHC.2003.1253887}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because Babbage's machine was never completed as a functioning standard in Lovelace's time, she unfortunately never had the opportunity to see the algorithm in action.

The first person to execute a program on a functioning, modern, electronic computer was the renowned [[computer scientist]] [[Konrad Zuse]], in 1941.

[[File:Two women operating ENIAC (full resolution).jpg|thumb|[[Jean Bartik|Betty Jennings]] and [[Frances Spence|Fran Bilas]], part of the first [[ENIAC]] programming team|alt=|left]]

The [[ENIAC]] programming team, consisting of [[Kathleen Antonelli|Kay McNulty]], [[Jean Bartik|Betty Jennings]], [[Betty Holberton|Betty Snyder]], [[Marlyn Meltzer|Marlyn Wescoff]], [[Frances Spence|Fran Bilas]] and [[Ruth Teitelbaum|Ruth Lichterman]] were the first regularly working programmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eniacprogrammers.org/eniac-programmers-project/memorials/ |title=Memorials |publisher=Eniacprogrammers.org |date= |accessdate=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=3951187&amp;page=1 |title=ABC News: First Computer Programmers Inspire Documentary |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2007-12-04 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
International Programmers' Day is celebrated annually on 7 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalprogrammersday.org |title=International Programmers' Day |access-date=19 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103212304/http://internationalprogrammersday.org/ |archive-date=3 January 2018 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the [[government of Russia]] decreed a professional annual holiday known as [[Programmers' Day]] to be celebrated on 13 September (12 September in leap years). It had already been an ''unofficial'' holiday before that in many countries.

=== Software ===
The word ''software'' was used as early as 1953, but did not regularly appear in print until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/tocsoft.html|title=Softword: Provenance for the Word 'Software'|author=Paul Niquette|year=1995}} adapted from ''Sophisticated: The Magazine'' {{ISBN|1-58922-233-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this time, computers were programmed either by customers or the few commercial computer manufacturers of the time, such as [[UNIVAC]] and [[IBM]]. The first company founded to specifically provide software products and services was the [[Computer Usage Company]], in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Elmer C. Kubie|date=Summer 1994|title=Recollections of the first software company|journal=[[Annals of the History of Computing]]|volume=16|issue=2|pages=65–71|doi=10.1109/85.279238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The software industry expanded in the early 1960s, almost immediately after computers were first sold in mass-produced quantities. Universities, governments and businesses created a demand for software. Many of these programs were written in-house by full-time staff programmers; some were distributed freely between users of a particular machine for no charge. And others were developed on a commercial basis. Other firms, such as [[Computer Sciences Corporation]] (founded in 1959) also started to grow. The computer/[[Computer hardware|hardware]] manufacturers soon started bundling [[operating systems]], [[system software]] and programming environments with their machines.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The industry expanded greatly with the rise of the [[personal computer]] ("PC") in the mid-1970s, which brought computing to the average  office worker. In the following years the PC also helped create a constantly-growing market for games, applications and utilities software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/1993-02-28/is-microsoft-too-powerful|title=Is Microsoft Too Powerful?|author1=Rebello, Kathy|author2=Schwartz, Evan I.|date=28 February 1993|website=Businessweek Archives|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=26 September 2014|author3=Verity, John W.|author4=Lewyn, Mark|author5=Levine, Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the 21st century, another successful [[business model]] has arisen for hosted software, called [[software-as-a-service]], or SaaS. From the point of view of producers of some [[proprietary software]], SaaS reduces the concerns about [[Software copyright|unauthorized copying]], since it can only be accessed through the Web, and by definition, no [[client software]] is loaded onto the end user's PC. SaaS is typically run out of the [[Cloud computing|cloud]].&lt;ref name="hardiman2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/a-portrait-of-the-modern-cloud-developer/|title=A portrait of the modern cloud developer|author=Hardiman, Nick|date=24 July 2014|work=[[TechRepublic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of the work==
:''Some of this section is from the [http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos110.htm Occupational Outlook Handbook], 2006–07 Edition, which is in the [[public domain]] as a [[work of the United States Government]].''

Computer programmers write, test, [[debug]], and maintain the detailed instructions, called [[computer programs]], that computers must follow to perform their functions. Programmers also conceive, design, and test logical structures for solving problems by computer. Many technical innovations in programming&amp;nbsp;— advanced computing technologies and sophisticated new languages and programming tools&amp;nbsp;— have redefined the role of a programmer and elevated much of the programming work done today. Job titles and descriptions may vary, depending on the organization.

Programmers work in many settings, including corporate [[information technology]] ("IT") departments, big [[software companies]], small service firms and government entities of all sizes. Many professional programmers also work for consulting companies at client sites as [[Independent contractor|contractors]]. [[License|Licensing]] is not typically required to work as a programmer, although [[professional certification]]s are commonly held by programmers. Programming is widely considered a [[profession]] (although some{{Who|date=March 2011}} authorities disagree on the grounds that only careers with legal licensing requirements count as a profession).

Programmers' work varies widely depending on the type of business for which they are writing programs. For example, the instructions involved in updating financial records are very different from those required to duplicate conditions on an aircraft for pilots training in a flight simulator. Simple programs can be written in a few hours, more complex ones may require more than a year of work, while others are never considered 'complete' but rather are continuously improved as long as they stay in use. In most cases, several programmers work together as a team under a senior programmer's supervision.
[[File:Coding Shots Annual Plan high res-5.jpg|thumb|225x225px|A software engineer writing [[JavaScript]]]]
Programmers write programs according to the specifications determined primarily by more senior programmers and by [[systems analyst]]s. After the design process is complete, it is the job of the programmer to convert that design into a logical series of instructions that the computer can follow. The programmer codes these instructions in one of many programming languages. Different programming languages are used depending on the purpose of the program. [[COBOL]], for example, is commonly used for business applications that typically run on [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] and [[minicomputer|midrange]] computers, whereas [[Fortran]] is used in science and engineering. [[C++]] and [[Python (Programming Language)|Python]] are widely used for both scientific and business applications. [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[JavaScript|JS]]  and [[PHP]] are popular programming languages for Web and business applications. Programmers generally know more than one programming language and, because many languages are similar, they often can learn new languages relatively easily. In practice, programmers often are referred to by the language they know, e.g. as ''Java programmers'', or by the type of function they perform or environment in which they work: for example, ''[[database]] programmers'', ''mainframe programmers'', or [[Web developer]]s.

When making changes to the [[source code]] that programs are made up of, programmers need to make other programmers aware of the task that the routine is to perform. They do this by inserting comments in the [[source code]] so that others can understand the program more easily and by [[Software documentation|documenting their code]]. To save work, programmers often use [[Library (computing)|libraries]] of basic code that can be modified or customized for a specific application. This approach yields more reliable and consistent programs and increases programmers' productivity by eliminating some routine steps.

===Testing and debugging===
Programmers test a program by running it and looking for [[Software bug|bugs]] (errors). As they are identified, the programmer usually makes the appropriate corrections, then rechecks the program until an acceptably low level and severity of bugs remain. This process is called [[Software testing|testing]] and [[debugging]]. These are important parts of every programmer's job. Programmers may continue to fix these problems throughout the life of a program. Updating, repairing, modifying, and expanding existing programs is sometimes called ''maintenance programming''. Programmers may contribute to [[user guide]]s and [[online help]], or they may work with [[technical writer]]s to do such work.

===Application versus system programming===
Computer programmers often are grouped into two broad types: application programmers and systems programmers. Application programmers write programs to handle a specific job, such as a program to track inventory within an organization. They also may revise existing packaged software or customize generic applications which are frequently purchased from [[independent software vendor]]s. Systems programmers, in contrast, write programs to maintain and control computer systems software, such as [[operating system]]s and [[database management system]]s. These workers make changes in the instructions that determine how the network, workstations, and [[Central processing unit|CPU]] of the system handle the various jobs they have been given and how they communicate with peripheral equipment such as [[Computer printer|printers]] and [[Data storage device|disk drives]].

=== Qualifications and skills ===
A software developer needs to have deep technical expertise with certain aspects of computing. Some positions will require a degree in a relevant field such as computer science, information technology, engineering, programming, or any other IT related post graduate studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite blog|title=Software Engineer Skills and Responsibilities|url=http://www.jobawareness.com/software-engineer.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ideal software developer is a self-motivated professional carrying a dynamic hands-on experience on key languages of programming such as [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[PHP]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[JavaScript|Javascript]], [[Visual Basic]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Smalltalk]].

According to developer Eric Sink, the differences between system design, [[software development]], and programming are more apparent. Already in the current market place there can be found a segregation between programmers and developers, in that one who implements is not the same as the one who designs the [[Class (computer science)|clas]]s structure or hierarchy. Even more so that developers become [[software architect]]s or [[systems architect]]s, those who design the multi-leveled architecture or component interactions of a large software system.&lt;ref name="Sourcegear_2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://software.ericsink.com/No_Programmers.html|title=Small ISVs: You need Developers, not Programmers|author=Eric Sink|publisher=Sourcegear|accessdate=2008-06-06|quote=A programmer is someone who does nothing but code new features and (if you're lucky) fix bugs. They don't write specs. They don't write automated test cases. They don't help keep the automated build system up to date. They don't help customers work out tough problems. They don't help write documentation. They don't help with testing. They don't even read code. All they do is write new code.|author-link=Eric Sink}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of software===
Programmers in software development companies may work directly with experts from various fields to create software&amp;nbsp;– either programs designed for specific clients or packaged software for general use&amp;nbsp;– ranging from [[video game]]s to educational software to programs for [[desktop publishing]] and financial planning. Programming of packaged software constitutes one of the most rapidly growing segments of the computer services industry. Some companies or organizations – even small ones – have set up their own IT team to ensure the design and development of in-house software to answer to very specific needs from their internal end-users, especially when existing software are not suitable or too expensive. This is for example the case in [[research laboratories]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In some organizations, particularly small ones, people commonly known as ''programmer analysts'' are responsible for both the systems analysis and the actual programming work. The transition from a mainframe environment to one that is based primarily on [[personal computers]] (PCs) has blurred the once rigid distinction between the programmer and the user. Increasingly, adept end users are taking over many of the tasks previously performed by programmers. For example, the growing use of packaged software, such as spreadsheet and database management software packages, allows users to write simple programs to access data and perform calculations.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In addition, the rise of the Internet has made [[web development]] a huge part of the programming field. Currently more software applications are [[web application]]s that can be used by anyone with a [[web browser]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Examples of such applications include the [[Google]] search service, the [[Outlook.com]] e-mail service, and the [[Flickr]] photo-sharing service.

Programming editors, also known as [[source code editor]]s, are text editors that are specifically designed for programmers or developers for writing the source code of an application or a program. Most of these editors include features useful for programmers, which may include color [[syntax highlighting]], auto indentation, [[auto-complete]], bracket matching, [[Syntax checker|syntax check]], and allows [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]s. These features aid the users during coding, [[debugging]] and testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zgmpr82/revision/4|title=BBC Bitesize - GCSE Computer Science - Programming software and the IDE - Revision 4|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Globalization==
{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=December 2010}}

===Market changes in the UK===
According to BBC News, 17% of computer science students could not find work in their field 6 months after graduation in 2009 which was the highest rate of the university subjects surveyed while 0% of medical students were unemployed in the same survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10477551|title='One in 10' UK graduates jobless|first=Martin|last=Shankleman|date=1 July 2010|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK category system does, however, class such degrees as [[information technology]] and [[game design]] as 'computer science', industries in which jobs can be extremely difficult to find, somewhat inflating the actual figure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=23727] ATAS classifications (University of Plymouth) {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100518224701/http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=23727 |date=18 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market changes in the US===
Computer programming, [[offshore outsourcing]], and [[Foreign Worker Visa]]s became a controversial topic after the crash of the [[dot-com bubble]] left many programmers without work or with lower wages. Programming was even mentioned in the 2004 US Presidential debate on the topic of [[offshore outsourcing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=october-8-2004-debate-transcript|title=CPD: October 8, 2004 Debate Transcript|website=www.debates.org|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large companies claim there is a [[skills shortage]] with regard to programming talent. However, US programmers and unions counter that large companies are exaggerating their case in order to obtain cheaper programmers from developing countries and avoid previously employer paid training using industry specific technologies not covered in most accredited degree programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/MigLtrs.pdf] Migration Letters, Volume: 10, No: 2, pp. 211 – 228 {{ISSN|1741-8984}} &amp; e{{ISSN|1741-8992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reasons for employers claiming skill shortages is the result of their own cost saving combining of several disparate skill sets previously held by several specialized programmers into fewer generalized [[Mechatronics|multifaceted]]  positions that are unlikely to have enough [[Purple squirrel|"qualified" candidates]] with the desired experience.&lt;ref&gt;"Purple Squirrels and the Reserve Army of the Unemployed" Paul Solman https://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/purple-squirrels-and-the-reser/ [[PBS]]August 15, 2012 accessdate  = 2016-06-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Enrollment in computer-related degrees in US has dropped recently{{when|date=May 2018}} due to lack of general interests in science and mathematics and also out of an apparent fear that programming will be subject to the same pressures as manufacturing and agriculture careers.&lt;ref&gt;Theresa Beaubouef and John Mason, [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1083474 Why the high attrition rate for computer science students: some thoughts and observations.], ACM SIGCSE Bulletin, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This situation has resulted in confusion about whether the US economy is entering a "post-[[Quaternary sector of the economy|information]] age" and the nature of US [[comparative advantage]]s. Most academic institutions have an [[Institutional research]] office that keep past statistics of degrees conferred which show several dips and rises in Computer Science degrees over the past 30 years. The overall trend shows a slightly overall decline in growth (especially when compared to other STEM degree growth) since certain peaks of [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|1986]], [[Early 1990s recession in the United States|1992]], [[Dot-com bubble|2002]], and [[Great Recession|2008]] showing periods of flat growth or even declines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/opub/regional_reports/200908_silicon_valley_high_tech.htm|title=After the Dot-Com Bubble: Silicon Valley High-Tech Employment And Wages in 2001 and 2008|website=www.bls.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook 2016-26 is -7% (a decline in their words) for Computer Programmers because [[Computer programming]] can be done from anywhere in the world, so companies sometimes hire programmers in countries where wages are lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-programmers.htm|title=Computer Programmers : Occupational Outlook Handbook: : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
