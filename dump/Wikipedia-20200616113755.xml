'''''Maya''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɑː|j|ə}}; [[Devanagari]]: {{lang|sa|माया}}, [[IAST]]: ''māyā''), literally "illusion" or "magic",{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=535}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000loch|url-access=registration|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M|last=Lochtefeld|first=James G.|date=|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=9780823931798|location=|pages=433|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has multiple meanings in [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophies]] depending on the context. In ancient Vedic literature, Māyā literally implies extraordinary power and wisdom.&lt;ref name=teun/&gt; In later [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]] texts and modern literature dedicated to Indian traditions, Māyā connotes a "magic show, an illusion where things appear to be present but are not what they seem".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sb"/&gt; Māyā is also a spiritual concept connoting "that which exists, but is constantly changing and thus is spiritually unreal", and the "power or the principle that conceals the true character of spiritual reality".&lt;ref&gt;M Hiriyanna (2000), ''The Essentials of Indian Philosophy'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120813304}}, pp. 25, 160-161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lynnfoulston&gt;Lynn Foulston and Stuart Abbott (2009), ''Hindu Goddesses: Beliefs and Practices'', Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1902210438}}, pp. 14-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Buddhism]], [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|Maya]] is the name of [[Gautama Buddha]]'s mother.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html|title=mAyA|last=|first=|date=|website=Sanskrit and Tamil Dictionaries|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Hinduism]], Maya is also an epithet for goddess,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000loch|url-access=registration|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M|last=Lochtefeld|first=James G.|date=|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=9780823931798|location=|pages=405|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the name of a manifestation of [[Lakshmi]], the goddess of "wealth, prosperity and love". Also, Maya refers to [[wealth]] or [[treasure]] itself. Many example of hidden treasures guarded by visible or invisible supernatural powers.   

Maya is also a [[Maya (given name)|name for girls]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alison Donnell (2013), Companion to Contemporary Black British Culture, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415862509}}, page 197&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and terminology==
''Māyā'' (Sanskrit: {{lang|sa|माया}}) is a word with unclear etymology, probably comes from the root ''mā''&lt;ref name=jangonda&gt;[[Jan Gonda]], ''Four studies in the language of the Veda'', Disputationes Rheno-Traiectinae (1959), pages 119-188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[a] Tracy Pintchman (1994), The Rise of the Goddess in the Hindu Tradition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791421123}}, pages 3-4;&lt;br&gt;[b] Donald Braue (2006), Maya in Radhakrishnan's Thought: Six Meanings other than Illusion, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120822979}}, page 101, Quote: "Etymologically, the term ''māyā'' is derived from the Sanskrit verbal root mā (...) Whitney says the primary meaning of √mā is 'to measure'. L Thomas O'Neil agrees in his helpful exposition of the ways and contexts in which ''māyā'' is used in the Rigvedic tradition."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adriansnodgrass29&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrian Snodgrass |title=The Symbolism of the Stupa |authorlink=Adrian Snodgrass |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nzqK8dDCM0UC |year=1992 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0781-5 |page=29 |quote=The word ''māyā'' comes from the same root ''mā'', "to measure", as does ''mātra'', "measure", which in turn is etymologically linked to the Latin ''materia'', from which our word "matter" derives. ''Materia'' not only relates to ''mater'', "mother" and to ''matrix'', but also to ''metiri'', "to measure, to lay out (a place)", (...)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bangala Bhasar Abhidhaan (Dictionary of the Bengali Language) Shishu Sahitya Samsad Pvt Ltd. 32A, APC Road, Kolakata&amp;nbsp;– 700009, Volume 2, p.1757 (ed. 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; which means "to measure".&lt;ref name=wmahonytau32/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass (1992), On Being and What There Is: Classical Vaisesika and the History of Indian Ontology, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791411780}}, page 42 footnote 40&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Monier Williams]], ''māyā'' meant "wisdom and extraordinary power" in an earlier older language, but from the Vedic period onwards, the word came to mean "illusion, unreality, deception, fraud, trick, sorcery, witchcraft and magic".&lt;ref name="sb"&gt;Bhattacharji, Sukumari (1970), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lDc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA35 The Indian Theogony: A Comparative Study of Indian Mythology from the Vedas to the Puraṇas], pages 35-37, Cambridge University Press Archive&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, P. D. Shastri states that the Monier Williams' list is a "loose definition, misleading generalization", and not accurate in interpreting ancient Vedic and medieval era Sanskrit texts; instead, he suggests a more accurate meaning of ''māyā'' is "appearance, not mere illusion".&lt;ref&gt;P. D. Shastri, [https://archive.org/details/thedoctrineofmaa00shaauoft The Doctrine of Maya] Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 5 and ix&lt;/ref&gt;

According to William Mahony, the root of the word may be ''man-'' or "to think", implying the role of imagination in the creation of the world. In early Vedic usage, the term implies, states Mahony, "the wondrous and mysterious  power to turn an idea into a physical reality".&lt;ref name=wmahonytau32&gt;William Mahony (1997), The Artful Universe: An Introduction to the Vedic Religious Imagination, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791435809}}, pages 32-33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teun Goudriaan (2008), Maya: Divine And Human, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120823891}}, pages 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin Southworth states the word's origin is uncertain, and other possible roots of ''māyā'' include ''may-'' meaning mystify, confuse, intoxicate, delude, as well as ''māy-'' which means "disappear, be lost".&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Southworth (2012), Linguistic Archaeology of South Asia, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415655446}}, page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jan Gonda]] considers the word related to ''mā'', which means "mother",&lt;ref name=jangonda/&gt; as do Tracy Pintchman&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Pintchman (1994), The Rise of the Goddess in the Hindu Tradition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791421123}}, page 30, Quote: "This material power is thereby readily linked to maternal creativity, a link made evident in the Sanskrit noun ''mā'', meaning both "mother" and "measure".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adrian Snodgrass]],&lt;ref name=adriansnodgrass29/&gt; serving as an epithet for goddesses such as [[Lakshmi]].&lt;ref name=jangonda/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary Etymologically and Philologically Arranged, Oxford University Press, page 764 (Article on "मा"), Quote: 4. ''mā'', f. measure; (...) 4.2 ''mātā'', ''mātṛi'', a mother; (...) a measurer in Nirukta XI, (...) a maker, former, creator, arranger, preparer (Ved.); a knower, one who infers correctly or has true knowledge; (...) the maker (of the child in the womb, ''jā-mātṛi''); a mother (...) mother earth (Rigveda V.42.16); (...) epithet of Lakshmi, (...) epithet of Durga (...)&lt;/ref&gt; Maya here implies art, is the maker's power, writes Zimmer, "a mother in all three worlds", a creatrix, her magic is the activity in the Will-spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Heinrich Robert Zimmer |title=Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization |year=2015|publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-1-4008-6684-7|pages=24–25|quote=Quote: Māyā is precisely the maker's power or art, “Magic” in Jacob Boehme's sense: “It is a mother in all three worlds, and makes each thing after the model of that thing's will, it is not the understanding, but it is a creatrix according to the understanding, and lends itself to good or to evil (...) In sum: Magic is the activity in the Will-spirit.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar word is also found in the [[Avesta]]n ''māyā'' with the meaning of "magic power".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Boyce (1996), A History of Zoroastrianism: The Early Period, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004104747}}, page 38-40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
====The Vedas====
Words related to and containing ''Māyā'', such as ''Mayava'', occur many times in the [[Vedas]]. These words have various meanings, with interpretations that are contested,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3ksBrWoZm0C|title=Vedic Civilization|last=Pruthi|first=Raj|date=|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|year=2004|isbn=9788171418756|location=|pages=222–223|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some are names of deities that do not appear in texts of 1st millennium BCE and later. The use of word Māyā in Rig veda, in the later era context of "magic, illusion, power", occurs in many hymns. One titled [[Mayabheda|Māyā-bheda]] (मायाभेद:, Discerning Illusion) includes hymns 10.177.1 through 10.177.3, as the battle unfolds between the good and the evil, as follows,&lt;ref name=lauriepatton/&gt;

{{quote|&lt;poem lang="sa"&gt;
पतंगमक्तमसुरस्य '''माय'''या हृदा पश्यन्ति मनसा विपश्चितः ।
समुद्रे अन्तः कवयो वि चक्षते मरीचीनां पदमिच्छन्ति वेधसः ॥१॥
पतंगो वाचं मनसा बिभर्ति तां गन्धर्वोऽवदद्गर्भे अन्तः ।
तां द्योतमानां स्वर्यं मनीषामृतस्य पदे कवयो नि पान्ति ॥२॥
अपश्यं गोपामनिपद्यमानमा च परा च पथिभिश्चरन्तम् ।
स सध्रीचीः स विषूचीर्वसान आ वरीवर्ति भुवनेष्वन्तः ॥३॥
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
The wise behold with their mind in their heart the Sun, made manifest by the illusion of the [[Asura]];
The sages look into the solar orb, the ordainers desire the region of his rays.
The Sun bears the word in his mind; the Gandharva has spoken it within the wombs;
sages cherish it in the place of sacrifice, brilliant, heavenly, ruling the mind.
I beheld the protector, never descending, going by his paths to the east and the west;
clothing the quarters of the heaven and the intermediate spaces. He constantly revolves in the midst of the worlds.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|[[Rigveda|Rig veda]] X.177.1-3, Translated by Laurie Patton &lt;ref name=lauriepatton&gt;{{cite book|title=Bringing the Gods to Mind:Mantra and Ritual in Early Indian Sacrifice|author=Laurie L. Patton|publisher=University of California Press|page=132|date=2005}};&lt;br&gt;Sanskrit Original: [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.१७७ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं १०.१७७] Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The above Maya-bheda hymn discerns, using symbolic language, a contrast between mind influenced by light (sun) and magic (illusion of Asura). The hymn is a call to discern one's enemies, perceive artifice, and distinguish, using one's mind, between that which is perceived and that which is unperceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bringing the Gods to Mind:Mantra and Ritual in Early Indian Sacrifice|author=Laurie L. Patton|publisher=University of California Press|pages=137, 187|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rig veda does not connote the word Māyā as always good or always bad, it is simply a form of technique, mental power and means.&lt;ref name=beamsc&gt;Ben-Ami Scharfstein (1998), A Comparative History of World Philosophy: From the Upanishads to Kant, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791436844}}, page 376&lt;/ref&gt; Rig veda uses the word in two contexts, implying that there are two kinds of Māyā: divine Māyā and undivine Māyā, the former being the foundation of truth, the latter of falsehood.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1917, Reprinted 1998), The Secret of the Veda, Volume 15, Sri Aurobindo Ashram Press, page 399, also see pages 225, 76, 89, 97, 512&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere in Vedic mythology, [[Indra]] uses Maya to conquer [[Vritra]].&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;Williams, George M., (2008). Handbook of Hindu Mythology, p.214. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780195332612}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Varuna]]'s supernatural power is called Maya.&lt;ref name="sb"/&gt; ''Māyā'', in such examples, connotes powerful magic, which both ''devas'' (gods) and ''asuras'' (demons) use against each other.&lt;ref name="sb"/&gt; In the [[Yajurveda]], ''māyā'' is an unfathomable plan.&lt;ref&gt;Desai, Gandabhai Girijashanker (1967). Thinking with the Yajurveda, p.16. Asia Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Aitareya Brahmana]] Maya is also referred to as Dirghajihvi, hostile to gods and sacrifices.&lt;ref name="agrawala"&gt;Agrawala, Prithvi Kumar (1984). Goddessess in Ancient India, p.121-123. Abhinav Publications, {{ISBN|0391029606}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=8BmDIbNuD0gC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=maya+asura+goddess&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1WosUajLEY_V0gHeuIDgBw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=maya%20asura%20goddess&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The hymns in Book 8, Chapter 10 of Atharvaveda describe the primordial woman ''Virāj'' ({{lang|sa|विराज्}}, chief queen) and how she willingly gave the knowledge of food, plants, agriculture, husbandry, water, prayer, knowledge, strength, inspiration, concealment, charm, virtue, vice to gods, demons, men and living creatures, despite all of them making her life miserable. In hymns of 8.10.22, ''Virāj'' is used by Asuras (demons) who call her as Māyā, as follows,

{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
She rose. The Asuras saw her. They called her. Their cry was, "Come, O Māyā, come thou hither" !!
Her cow was Virochana Prahradi. Her milking vessel was a pan of iron.
Dvimurdha Artvya milked this Māyā.
The Asuras depend for life on Māyā for their sustenance.
One who knows this, becomes a fit supporter [of gods].
&lt;/poem&gt;
|[[Atharvaveda|Atharva veda]] VIII.10.22 &lt;ref&gt;Original Sanskrit: [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/अथर्ववेदः/अथर्ववेद:_काण्डं_8 अथर्ववेद: काण्डं 8] Wikisource;&lt;br&gt;English Translation: [https://archive.org/stream/hymnsatharvaved03unkngoog#page/n186/mode/2up Atharva Veda] Ralph Griffith (Translator), verse 22 (page 423), pages 421-426&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The contextual meaning of Maya in Atharvaveda is "power of creation", not illusion.&lt;ref name=beamsc/&gt; [[Jan Gonda|Gonda]] suggests the central meaning of Maya in Vedic literature is, "wisdom and power enabling its possessor, or being able itself, to create, devise, contrive, effect, or do something".&lt;ref name=teun&gt;Teun Goudriaan (2008), Maya: Divine And Human, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120823891}}, page 1, and 2-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Gonda (1952), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40879558 Maya], Tijdschrift voor Philosophie, 14de Jaarg., Nr. 1 (MAART 1952), pages 3-62;&lt;br&gt;English excerpted version: J. Gonda (1962), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1062054 Some Notes on the Study of Ancient-Indian Religious Terminology], History of Religions, Vol. 1, No. 2 (Winter, 1962), pages 243-273; Gonda's interpretation of Maya in Vedic texts is on page 248&lt;/ref&gt; Maya stands for anything that has real, material form, human or non-human, but that does not reveal the hidden principles and implicit knowledge that creates it.&lt;ref name=teun/&gt; An illustrative example of this in Rig veda VII.104.24 and Atharva veda VIII.4.24 where Indra is invoked against the Maya of sorcerers appearing in the illusory form&amp;nbsp;– like a ''[[Fata Morgana (mirage)|fata morgana]]''&amp;nbsp;– of animals to trick a person.&lt;ref&gt;Teun Goudriaan (2008), Maya: Divine And Human, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120823891}}, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Upanishads====
[[File:Waterfall.svg|thumb|[[M. C. Escher]] paintings such as the [[Waterfall (M. C. Escher)|Waterfall]]&amp;nbsp;– redrawn in this sketch&amp;nbsp;– demonstrates the Hindu concept of Maya, states Jeffrey Brodd.&lt;ref&gt;J Brodd, World Religions: A Voyage of Discovery, 3rd Edition, Saint Mary's Press, {{ISBN|978-0884899976}}, page 55&lt;/ref&gt; The impression of water-world the sketch gives, in reality is not what it seems.]]
The [[Upanishads]] describe the universe, and the human experience, as an interplay of [[Purusha]] (the eternal, unchanging principles, consciousness) and [[Prakṛti]] (the temporary, changing material world, nature).&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], {{Google books|2h0YAAAAYAAJ|The Philosophy of the Upanishads|page=161}}, pages 161, 240-254&lt;/ref&gt; The former manifests itself as [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]] (Soul, Self), and the latter as Māyā. The Upanishads refer to the knowledge of Atman as "true knowledge" (''Vidya''), and the knowledge of Maya as "not true knowledge" (''Avidya'', Nescience, lack of awareness, lack of true knowledge).&lt;ref name=beamsc/&gt; [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], states Ben-Ami Scharfstein, describes Maya as "the tendency to imagine something where it does not exist, for example, atman with the body".&lt;ref name=beamsc/&gt; To the Upanishads, knowledge includes empirical knowledge and spiritual knowledge, complete knowing necessarily includes understanding the hidden principles that work, the realization of the soul of things.

Hendrick Vroom explains, "The term ''Maya'' has been translated as 'illusion,' but then it does not concern normal illusion. Here 'illusion' does not mean that the world is not real and simply a figment of the human imagination. ''Maya'' means that the world is not as it seems; the world that one experiences is misleading as far as its true nature is concerned."&lt;ref&gt;H.M. Vroom (1996), No Other Gods, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0802840974}}, page 57&lt;/ref&gt; Lynn Foulston states, "The world is both real and unreal because it exists but is 'not what it appears to be'."&lt;ref name=lynnfoulston/&gt; According to Wendy Doniger, "to say that the universe is an illusion (māyā) is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say, instead, that it is not what it seems to be, that it is something constantly being made. Māyā not only deceives people about the things they think they know; more basically, it limits their knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty (1986), Dreams, Illusion, and Other Realities, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226618555}}, page 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Māyā pre-exists and co-exists with [[Brahman]]&amp;nbsp;– the Ultimate Principle, Consciousness.&lt;ref name=aegough&gt;Archibald Edward Gough (2001), The Philosophy of the Upanishads and Ancient Indian Metaphysics, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415245227}}, pages 47-48&lt;/ref&gt; Maya is perceived reality, one that does not reveal the hidden principles, the true reality. Maya is unconscious, Atman is conscious. Maya is the literal, Brahman is the figurative ''Upādāna''&amp;nbsp;– the principle, the cause.&lt;ref name=aegough/&gt; Maya is born, changes, evolves, dies with time, from circumstances, due to invisible principles of nature, state the Upanishads. Atman-Brahman is eternal, unchanging, invisible principle, unaffected absolute and resplendent consciousness. Maya concept in the Upanishads, states Archibald Gough, is "the indifferent aggregate of all the possibilities of emanatory or derived existences, pre-existing with Brahman", just like the possibility of a future tree pre-exists in the seed of the tree.&lt;ref name=aegough/&gt;

The concept of Maya appears in numerous Upanishads. The verses 4.9 to 4.10 of [[Svetasvatara Upanishad]], is the oldest explicit occurrence of the idea that Brahman (Supreme Soul) is the hidden reality, nature is magic, Brahman is the magician, human beings are infatuated with the magic and thus they create bondage to illusions and delusions, and for freedom and liberation one must seek true insights and correct knowledge of the principles behind the hidden magic.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 316-317&lt;/ref&gt; Gaudapada in his Karika on [[Mandukya Upanishad]] explains the interplay of Atman and Maya as follows,&lt;ref name=pauldvol2&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814691}}, page 618&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
The Soul is imagined first, then the particularity of objects,
External and internal, as one knows so one remembers.
As a rope, not perceived distinctly in dark, is erroneously imagined,
As snake, as a streak of water, so is the Soul (Atman) erroneously imagined.
As when the rope is distinctly perceived, and the erroneous imagination withdrawn,
Only the rope remains, without a second, so when distinctly perceived, the Atman.
When he as Pranas (living beings), as all the diverse objects appears to us,
Then it is all mere Maya, with which the Brahman (Supreme Soul) deceives himself.

Sarvasara Upanishad refers to two concepts: ''Mithya'' and ''Maya''.&lt;ref name=knaiyar/&gt; It defines ''Mithya'' as illusion and calls it one of three kinds of substances, along with Sat (Be-ness, True) and Asat (not-Be-ness, False).  ''Maya'', Sarvasara Upanishad defines as all what is not Atman. Maya has no beginning, but has an end. Maya, declares Sarvasara, is anything that can be studied and subjected to proof and disproof, anything with [[Guṇa]]s.&lt;ref name=knaiyar/&gt; In the human search for Self-knowledge, Maya is that which obscures, confuses and distracts an individual.&lt;ref name=knaiyar&gt;KN Aiyar (Translator, 1914), Sarvasara Upanishad, in Thirty Minor Upanishads, page 17, {{oclc|6347863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Puranas and Tamil texts====
[[File:Kamchipuram 4015.jpg|thumb|Markandeya sees Vishnu as an infant on a fig leaf in the deluge]]
In [[Puranas]] and Vaishnava theology, ''māyā'' is described as one of the nine shaktis of [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name="sb1"&gt;Bhattacharji, Sukumari (1970). ''The Indian Theogony: A Comparative Study of Indian Mythology from the Vedas to the Puraṇas'', pp. 312-345. CUP Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Māyā'' became associated with sleep; and Vishnu's ''māyā'' is sleep which envelopes the world when he awakes to destroy evil. Vishnu, like Indra, is the master of ''māyā''; and ''māyā'' envelopes Vishnu's body.&lt;ref name="sb1"/&gt; The ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' narrates that the sage [[Markandeya]] requests Vishnu to experience his ''māyā''. Vishnu appears as an infant floating on a fig leaf in a deluge and then swallows the sage, the sole survivor of the cosmic flood. The sage sees various worlds of the universe, gods etc. and his own hermitage in the infant's belly. Then the infant breathes out the sage, who tries to embrace the infant, but everything disappears and the sage realizes that he was in his hermitage the whole time and was given a flavor of Vishnu's ''māyā''.&lt;ref name="Brown1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cheever Mackenzie Brown|title=The Triumph of the Goddess: The Canonical Models and Theological Visions of the Devi-Bhagavata Purana|year=1990|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0363-1|chapter=The two Bhagavatas|pages=27–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magic creative power, ''Māyā'' was always a monopoly of the central Solar God; and was also associated with the early solar prototype of Vishnu in the early Aditya phase.&lt;ref name="sb1"/&gt;

Maya, to Shaiva Siddhanta sub-school of Hinduism, states Hilko Schomerus, is reality and truly existent, and one that exists to "provide Souls with ''Bhuvana'' (a world), ''Bhoga'' (objects of enjoyment), ''Tanu'' (a body) and ''Karana'' (organs)".&lt;ref&gt;Hilko Schomerus (2000), Śaiva Siddhānta: An Indian School of Mystical Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120815698}}, page 118&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools of Hinduism===
====Need to understand Māyā====
The various schools of Hinduism, particularly those based on naturalism ([[Vaisheshika|Vaiśeṣika]]), rationalism ([[Samkhya]]) or ritualism ([[Mimamsa]]), questioned and debated what is Maya, and the need to understand Maya.&lt;ref name=adishankarabr&gt;Adi Shankara (Translator: S Vireswarananda), Commentary on Brahma-sutras, Advaita Ashrama, pages 30-37, [https://archive.org/stream/BrahmaSutraBhashyaByAdiShankaracharyasanskrit.pdf/Brahma.Sutra.Bhashya.By.Adi.Shankaracharya.Sanskrit#page/n1/mode/2up Archive in Sanskrit], [http://www.estudantedavedanta.net/Brahma%20Sutras%20-%20According%20to%20Sri%20Sankara%20by%20Swami%20Vireswarananda%20&amp;#91;Sanskrit-English&amp;#93;.pdf Translated in English]&lt;/ref&gt; The Vedanta and Yoga schools explained that complete realization of knowledge requires both the understanding of ignorance, doubts and errors, as well as the understanding of invisible principles, incorporeal and the eternal truths. In matters of Self-knowledge, stated Shankara in his commentary on [[Taittiriya Upanishad]],&lt;ref name=adishankaratu/&gt; one is faced with the question, "Who is it that is trying to know, and how does he attain Brahman?" It is absurd, states Shankara, to speak of one becoming himself; because "Thou Art That" already. Realizing and removing ignorance is a necessary step, and this can only come from understanding Maya and then looking beyond it.&lt;ref name=adishankaratu&gt;Adi Shankara, {{Google books|d0oAAAAYAAJ|Commentary on Taittiriya Upanishad}}, SS Sastri (Translator), Harvard University Archives, pages 191-198&lt;/ref&gt;

The need to understand Maya is like the metaphorical need for road. Only when the country to be reached is distant, states Shankara, that a road must be pointed out. It is a meaningless contradiction to assert, "I am right now in my village, but I need a road to reach my village."&lt;ref name=adishankaratu/&gt; It is the confusion, ignorance and illusions that need to be repealed. It is only when the knower sees nothing else but his Self that he can be fearless and permanent.&lt;ref name=adishankarabr/&gt;&lt;ref name=adishankaratu/&gt; Vivekananda explains the need to understand Maya as follows (abridged),&lt;ref name=vivekananda7&gt;S Vivekananda, {{Google books|UAONAwAAQBAJ|The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda}}, Volume 7, pages 63-65&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
The Vedas cannot show you Brahman, you are That already. They can only help to take away the veil that hides truth from our eyes. The cessation of ignorance can only come when I know that God and I are one; in other words, identify yourself with Atman, not with human limitations. The idea that we are bound is only an illusion [Maya]. Freedom is inseparable from the nature of the Atman. This is ever pure, ever perfect, ever unchangeable.
|[[Adi Shankara]]'s commentary on Fourth Vyasa Sutra, [[Swami Vivekananda]] &lt;ref name=vivekananda7/&gt;}}

The text [[Yoga Vasistha]] explains the need to understand Maya as follows,&lt;ref name=sven/&gt;

{{quote|
Just as when the dirt is removed, the real substance is made manifest; just as when the darkness of the night is dispelled, the objects that were shrouded by the darkness are clearly seen, when ignorance [Maya] is dispelled, truth is realized.

====Samkhya school====
The early works of Samkhya, the rationalist school of Hinduism, do not identify or directly mention the Maya doctrine.&lt;ref name="nakamura"&gt;Nakamura, Hajime (1990). A History of Early Vedānta Philosophy, p.335-336. Motilal Banarsidass Publications. {{ISBN|9788120806511}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion of Maya theory, calling it into question, appears after the theory gains ground in Vedanta school of Hinduism. [[Vācaspati Miśra]]'s commentary on the ''Samkhyakarika'', for example, questions the Maya doctrine saying "It is not possible to say that the notion of the phenomenal world being real is false, for there is no evidence to contradict it".&lt;ref name="nakamura"/&gt; Samkhya school steadfastly retained its duality concept of Prakrti and Purusha, both real and distinct, with some texts equating Prakrti to be Maya that is "not illusion, but real", with three [[Guṇa]]s in different proportions whose changing state of equilibrium defines the perceived reality.&lt;ref&gt;Teun Goudriaan (2008), Maya: Divine And Human, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120823891}}, pages 4 and 167&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James R. Ballantyne|James Ballantyne]], in 1885, commented on Kapila's Sánkhya aphorism 5.72{{refn|group=note|{{lang|sa|प्रकृतिपुरुष योरन्यत्सर्वमनित्यम् ॥७२॥}}}} which he translated as, "everything except nature and soul is uneternal". According to Ballantyne, this aphorism states that the mind, ether, etc. in a state of cause (not developed into a product) are called Nature and not Intellect. He adds, that scriptural texts such as [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] to be stating "He should know Illusion to be Nature and him in whom is Illusion to be the great Lord and the world to be pervaded by portions of him'; since Soul and Nature are also made up of parts, they must be uneternal".&lt;ref name=ballantyne373&gt;Ballantyne, James Robert (1885), The Sánkhya Aphorisms of Kapila, pp. 373-374 with footnote 6, Trubner's Oriental Series, Reprinted by Routledge (2000), {{ISBN|0415245141}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, acknowledges Ballantyne,&lt;ref name=ballantyne373/&gt; Edward Gough translates the same verse in [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] differently, 'Let the sage know that Prakriti is Maya and that Mahesvara is the Mayin, or arch-illusionist. All this shifting world is filled with portions of him'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/philosophyoftheu004284mbp#page/n241/mode/2up The Philosophy of the Upanishads and Ancient Indian Metaphysics] Edward Gough, page 224&lt;/ref&gt; In continuation of the Samkhya and Upanishadic view, in the Bhagavata philosophy, Maya has been described as 'that which appears even when there is no object like silver in a shell and which does not appear in the atman'; with maya described as the power that creates, maintains and destroys the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Vyas, Ramnarayan.(1974). The Synthetic Philosophy of the Bhāgavata, p.101. Meharchand Lachhmandas.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nyaya school====
The realism-driven Nyaya school of Hinduism denied that either the world (Prakrti) or the soul (Purusa) are an illusion. Naiyayikas developed theories of illusion, typically using the term ''Mithya'', and stated that illusion is simply flawed cognition, incomplete cognition or the absence of cognition.&lt;ref name= stephenphillipsnyaya/&gt; There is no deception in the reality of Prakrti or ''[[Pradhana]]'' (creative principle of matter/nature) or Purusa, only confusion or lack of comprehension or lack of cognitive effort, according to Nyaya scholars. To them, illusion has a cause, that rules of reason and proper ''[[Pramanas]]'' (epistemology) can uncover.&lt;ref name= stephenphillipsnyaya/&gt;

Illusion, stated Naiyayikas, involves the projection into current cognition of predicated content from memory (a form of rushing to interpret, judge, conclude). This "projection illusion" is misplaced, and stereotypes something to be what it is not.&lt;ref name=stephenphillipsnyaya&gt;Stephen H Phillips (2012), Epistemology in Classical India: The Knowledge Sources of the Nyaya School, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1138008816}}, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; The insights on theory of illusion by Nyaya scholars were later adopted and applied by Advaita Vedanta scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Bina Gupta (1995), Perceiving in Advaita Vedānta: Epistemological Analysis and Interpretation, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812963}}, pages 29-38, 117-132&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yoga school====
Maya in Yoga school is the manifested world and implies divine force.&lt;ref name=teun66&gt;Teun Goudriaan (2008), Maya: Divine And Human, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120823891}}, page 66&lt;/ref&gt; Yoga and Maya are two sides of the same coin, states Zimmer, because what is referred to as Maya by living beings who are enveloped by it, is Yoga for the Brahman (Universal Principle, Supreme Soul) whose yogic perfection creates the Maya.&lt;ref&gt;HR Zimmer (1978), Maya: der indische Mythos, Insel-Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3458058816}}, page 62 (German), {{oclc|760396118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maya is neither illusion nor denial of perceived reality to the Yoga scholars, rather Yoga is a means to perfect the "creative discipline of mind" and "body-mind force" to transform Maya.&lt;ref&gt;Teun Goudriaan (2008), Maya: Divine And Human, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120823891}}, pages 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Yoga as power to create Maya has been adopted as a compound word ''Yogamaya'' (योगमाया) by the theistic sub-schools of Hinduism. It occurs in various mythologies of the Puranas; for example, Shiva uses his ''yogamāyā'' to transform Markendeya's heart in [[Bhagavata Purana]]'s chapter 12.10, while Krishna counsels Arjuna about ''yogamāyā'' in hymn 7.25 of [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref name=teun66/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/भगवद्गीता/ज्ञानविज्ञानयोगः भगवद्गीता/ज्ञानविज्ञानयोगः], Bhagavad Gita 7.25, Wikisource (Sanskrit)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vedanta school====
Maya is a prominent and commonly referred to concept in Vedanta philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;PD Shastri, [https://archive.org/details/thedoctrineofmaa00shaauoft The Doctrine of Maya] Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Radhakrishnan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2376777 The Vedanta Philosophy and the Doctrine of Maya], International Journal of Ethics, Vol. 24, No. 4 (Jul., 1914), pages 431-451&lt;/ref&gt; Maya is often translated as "illusion", in the sense of "appearance".&lt;ref&gt;Donald Braue (2006), Maya in Radhakrishnan's Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120822979}}, pages 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph P. Schultz (1979), Judaism and the Gentile Faiths: Comparative Studies in Religion, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, {{ISBN|978-0838617076}}, page 93&lt;/ref&gt; Human mind constructs a subjective experience, states Vedanta school, which leads to the peril of misunderstanding Maya as well as interpreting Maya as the only and final reality. Vedantins assert the "perceived world including people are not what they appear to be".&lt;ref&gt;HM Vroom (1989), Religions and the Truth: Philosophical Reflections and Perspectives, Eerdmans Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0802805027}}, pages 122-123&lt;/ref&gt; There are invisible principles and laws at work, true invisible nature in others and objects, and invisible soul that one never perceives directly, but this invisible reality of Self and Soul exists, assert Vedanta scholars. Māyā is that which manifests, perpetuates a sense of false [[dualism (Indian philosophy)|duality]] (or divisional plurality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brodd | first = Jeffrey | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = World Religions | publisher = Saint Mary's Press | year = 2003 | location = Winona, MN | pages = | url = | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-88489-725-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This manifestation is real, but it obfuscates and eludes the hidden principles and true nature of reality. Vedanta school holds that liberation is the unfettered realization and understanding of these invisible principles&amp;nbsp;– the Self, that the Self (Soul) in oneself is same as the Self in another and the Self in everything (Brahman).&lt;ref&gt;PD Shastri, [https://archive.org/details/thedoctrineofmaa00shaauoft The Doctrine of Maya] Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 58-73&lt;/ref&gt; The difference within various sub-schools of Vedanta is the relationship between individual soul and cosmic soul (Brahman). Non-theistic Advaita sub-school holds that both are One, everyone is thus deeply connected Oneness, there is God in everyone and everything;&lt;ref&gt;A Rambachan (2006), The Advaita Worldview: God, World, and Humanity, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791468524}}, pages 47, 99-103&lt;/ref&gt; while theistic Dvaita and other sub-schools hold that individual souls and God's soul are distinct and each person can at best love God constantly to get one's soul infinitely close to His Soul.&lt;ref&gt;James Lewis and William Travis (1999), Religious Traditions of the World, {{ISBN|978-1579102302}}, pages 279-280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Padiyath (2014), The Metaphysics of Becoming, De Gruyter, {{ISBN|978-3110342550}}, pages 155-157&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advaita Vedanta====

In [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosophy, there are two realities: ''Vyavaharika'' (empirical reality) and ''Paramarthika'' (absolute, spiritual reality).&lt;ref name=fredfost&gt;Frederic F. Fost (1998), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1400333 Playful Illusion: The Making of Worlds in Advaita Vedānta], Philosophy East and West, Vol. 48, No. 3 (Jul., 1998), pages 387-405&lt;/ref&gt; Māyā is the empirical reality that entangles consciousness. Māyā has the power to create a bondage to the empirical world, preventing the unveiling of the true, unitary Self—the Cosmic Spirit also known as [[Brahman]]. The theory of māyā was developed by the ninth-century Advaita Hindu philosopher [[Adi Shankara]]. However, competing theistic Dvaita scholars contested Shankara's theory,&lt;ref&gt;Surendranath Dasgupta, ''A History of Indian Philosophy.'' Cambridge University Press Archive, 1955, page 1. "He [Bhaskara] speaks in very strong terms against the commentator [Shankara] who holds the ''māyā'' doctrine and is a Buddhist in his views. But, though he was opposed to Shankara, it was only so far as Shankara had introduced the ''māyā'' doctrine, and only so far as he thought the world had sprung forth not as a real modification of Brahman, but only through ''māyā''."&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that Shankara did not offer a theory of the relationship between Brahman and Māyā.&lt;ref&gt;Pratima Bowes, "Mysticism in the Upanishads and Shankara's Vedanta" in Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic." Routledge, 1995, page 67.&lt;/ref&gt; A later Advaita scholar Prakasatman addressed this, by explaining, "Maya and Brahman together constitute the entire universe, just like two kinds of interwoven threads create a fabric. Maya is the manifestation of the world, whereas Brahman, which supports Maya, is the cause of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Esther Abraham Solomon (1969), Avidyā: A Problem of Truth and Reality, {{oclc|658823}}, pages 269-270&lt;/ref&gt;

Māyā is a fact in that it is the appearance of phenomena. Since Brahman is the sole metaphysical truth, Māyā is true in epistemological and empirical sense; however, Māyā is not the metaphysical and spiritual truth. The spiritual truth is the truth forever, while what is empirical truth is only true for now. Since Māyā is the perceived material world, it is true in perception context, but is "untrue" in spiritual context of Brahman. Māyā is not false, it only clouds the inner Self and principles that are real. True Reality includes both ''Vyavaharika'' (empirical) and ''Paramarthika'' (spiritual), the Māyā and the Brahman. The goal of spiritual enlightenment, state Advaitins, is to realize Brahman, realize the fearless, resplendent Oneness.&lt;ref name=fredfost/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Sharma (2007), Advaita Vedānta: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820272}}, pages 19-40, 53-58, 79-86&lt;/ref&gt;

Vivekananda said: "When the Hindu says the world is Maya, at once people get the idea that the world is an illusion. This interpretation has some basis, as coming through the Buddhistic philosophers, because there was one section of philosophers who did not believe in the external world at all. But the Maya of the Vedanta, in its last developed form, is neither Idealism nor Realism, nor is it a theory. It is a simple statement of facts&amp;nbsp;— what we are and what we see around us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_2/jnana-yoga/maya_and_illusion.htm|title=Maya and illusion|website=www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{Buddhism}}
{{see also|Kleshas (Buddhism)|Maya (Buddhist mental factor)|Maya (mother of the Buddha)}}
The [[Early Buddhist Texts]] contain some references to illusion, the most well known of which is the ''Pheṇapiṇḍūpama Sutta'' in Pali (and with a Chinese Agama parallel at SĀ 265) which states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose, monks, that a magician (māyākāro) or a magician’s apprentice (māyākārantevāsī) would display a magical illusion (māyaṃ) at a crossroads. A man with good sight would inspect it, ponder, and carefully investigate it, and it would appear to him to be void (rittaka), hollow (tucchaka), coreless (asāraka). For what core (sāro) could there be in a magical illusion (māyāya)? So too, monks, whatever kind of cognition there is, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near: a monk inspects it, ponders it, and carefully investigates it, and it would appear to him to be void (rittaka), hollow (tucchaka), coreless (asāraka). For what core (sāro) could there be in cognition?&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One sutra in the Āgama collection known as "Mahāsūtras" of the (Mūla)Sarvāstivādin tradition entitled the ''Māyājāla'' (Net of Illusion) deals especially with the theme of Maya. This sutra only survives in Tibetan translation and compares the five aggregates with further metaphors for illusion, including: an echo, a reflection in a mirror, a mirage, sense pleasures in a dream and a madman wandering naked.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

These texts give the impression that māyā refers to the insubstantial and essence-less nature of things as well as their deceptive, false and vain character.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Later texts such as the [[Lalitavistara]] also contain references to illusion:

{{quote|Complexes have no inner might, are empty in themselves; Rather like the stem of the plantain tree, when one reflects on them, Like an illusion (māyopama) which deludes the mind (citta), Like an empty fist with which a child is teased.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;}}

The [[Salistamba Sutra]] also puts much emphasis on illusion, describing all dharmas as being “characterized as illusory” and “vain, hollow, without core”. Likewise the Mahāvastu, a highly influential Mahāsāṃghikan text on the life of the Buddha, states that the Buddha “has shown that the aggregates are like a lightning flash, as a bubble, or as the white foam on a wave.”&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Theravada===
In [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] 'Māyā' is the name of the mother of the Buddha as well as a metaphor for the consciousness aggregate (''viññana''). The Theravada monk Bhikkhu Bodhi considers the Pali ''Pheṇapiṇḍūpama Sutta'' “one of the most radical discourses on the empty nature of conditioned phenomena.”&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Bodhi also cites the Pali commentary on this sutra, the ''Sāratthappakāsinī'' (Spk), which states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cognition is like a magical illusion (māyā) in the sense that it is insubstantial and cannot be grasped. Cognition is even more transient and fleeting than a magical illusion. For it gives the impression that a person comes and goes, stands and sits, with the same mind, but the mind is different in each of these activities. Cognition deceives the multitude like a magical illusion (māyā).&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi, Connected Discourses of the Buddha Vol I p. 1087, n. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Likewise, Bhikkhu [[Katukurunde Nyanananda Thera]] has written an exposition of the ''Kàlakàràma Sutta'' which features the image of a magical illusion as its central metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Katukurunde Nyanananda Thera. The Magic of the Mind (PDF), Buddhist Publication Society, 1974, OCLC 2999880&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarvastivada===
The ''Nyānānusāra Śāstra'', a Vaibhāṣika response to [[Vasubandhu]]’s [[Abhidharmakosha]] cites the ''Māyājāla sutra'' and explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Seeing an illusory object (māyā)”: Although what one apprehends is unreal, nothing more than an illusory sign. If one does not admit this much, then an illusory sign should be non-existent. What is an illusory sign? It is the result of illusion magic. Just as one with higher gnosis can magically create forms, likewise this illusory sign does actually have manifestation and shape. Being produced by illusion magic, it acts as the object of vision. That object which is taken as really existent is in fact ultimately non-existent. Therefore, this [Māyājāla] Sūtra states that it is non-existent, due to the illusory object there is a sign but not substantiality. Being able to beguile and deceive one, it is known as a “deceiver of the eye.”&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mahayana===
In [[Mahayana sutras]], illusion is an important theme of the [[Prajñāpāramitā]] sutras. Here, the magician's illusion exemplifies how people misunderstand and misperceive reality, which is in fact empty of any essence and cannot be grasped. The Mahayana uses similar metaphors for illusion: magic, a dream, a bubble, a rainbow, lightning, the moon reflected in water, a mirage, and a city of celestial musicians." &lt;ref&gt;Thinley Norbe Rinpoche in The Dzogchen Primer, Marcia Binder Schmidt ed. Shambala, Boston, 2002, pg. 215 {{ISBN|1-57062-829-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding that what we experience is less substantial than we believe is intended to serve the purpose of liberation from ignorance, fear, and clinging and the attainment of enlightenment as a Buddha completely dedicated to the welfare of all beings. The Prajñaparamita texts also state that all dharmas (phenomena) are like an illusion, not just the [[five aggregates]], but all beings, including [[Bodhisattva]]s and even [[Nirvana]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The ''Prajñaparamita-ratnaguna-samcayagatha'' (Rgs) states:

{{quote|This gnosis shows him all beings as like an illusion, Resembling a great crowd of people, conjured up at the crossroads, By a magician, who then cuts off many thousands of heads; He knows this whole living world as a magical creation, and yet remains without fear. ''Rgs'' 1:19}}

And also:

{{quote|Those who teach Dharma, and those who listen when it is being taught; Those who have won the fruition of a Worthy One, a Solitary Buddha, or a World Savior; And the nirvāṇa obtained by the wise and learned— All is born of illusion—so has the Tathāgata declared. - ''Rgs'' 2:5 &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;}}

According to Ven. Dr. Huifeng, what this means is that Bodhisattvas see through all conceptualizations and conceptions, for they are deceptive and illusory, and sever or cut off all these cognitive creations.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Depending on the stage of the practitioner, the magical illusion is experienced differently. In the ordinary state, we get attached to our own mental phenomena, believing they are real, like the audience at a magic show gets attached to the illusion of a beautiful lady. At the next level, called actual relative truth, the beautiful lady appears, but the magician does not get attached.  Lastly, at the ultimate level, the Buddha is not affected one way or the other by the illusion. Beyond conceptuality, the Buddha is neither attached nor non-attached.&lt;ref&gt;Thinley Norbe Rinpoche in The Dzogchen Primer, Marcia Binder Schmidt ed. Shambala, Boston, 2002, pg. 217 {{ISBN|1-57062-829-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the middle way of Buddhism, which explicitly refutes the extremes of both eternalism and [[nihilism]].

[[Nāgārjuna]]'s [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy discusses ''nirmita'', or illusion closely related to māyā.  In this example, the illusion is a self-awareness that is, like the magical illusion, mistaken. For Nagarjuna, the self is not the organizing command center of experience, as we might think.  Actually, it is just one element combined with other factors and strung together in a sequence of causally connected moments in time. As such, the self is not substantially real, but neither can it be shown to be unreal. The continuum of moments, which we mistakenly understand to be a solid, unchanging self, still performs actions and undergoes their results. "As a magician creates a magical illusion by the force of magic, and the illusion produces another illusion, in the same way the agent is a magical illusion and the action done is the illusion created by another illusion."&lt;ref&gt;Nagarjuna's Mulamadhyamakakarika Prajna Nama, J.W. DeJong, Christian Lindtner (eds.) quoted in Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Jan Westerhoff, Oxford University Press, New York, 2009. p. 163 {{ISBN|978-0-19-537521-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; What we experience may be an illusion, but we are living inside the illusion and bear the fruits of our actions there. We undergo the experiences of the illusion. What we do affects what we experience, so it matters.&lt;ref&gt;Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Jan Westerhoff, Oxford University Press, New York, 2009. p. 164 {{ISBN|978-0-19-537521-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, Nagarjuna uses the magician's illusion to show that the self is not as real as it thinks, yet, to the extent it is inside the illusion, real enough to warrant respecting the ways of the world.

For the Mahayana Buddhist, the self is māyā like a magic show and so are objects in the world. Vasubandhu's ''Trisvabhavanirdesa'', a Mahayana [[Yogacara]] "Mind Only" text, discusses the example of the magician who makes a piece of wood appear as an elephant.&lt;ref name="autogenerated61"&gt;The Emptiness of Emptiness: An Introduction to Early Indian Madhyamika.  C.W. Huntingdon, Jr. with Geshe Namgyal Wangchen, University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu, 1989, {{ISBN|0-8248-1165-8}}, p.61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;  The audience is looking at a piece of wood but, under the spell of magic, perceives an elephant instead.  Instead of believing in the reality of the illusory elephant, we are invited to recognize that multiple factors are involved in creating that perception, including our involvement in dualistic subjectivity, causes and conditions, and the ultimate beyond duality. Recognizing how these factors combine to create what we perceive ordinarily, ultimate reality appears. Perceiving that the elephant is illusory is akin to seeing through the magical illusion, which reveals the [[dharmadhatu]], or ground of being.&lt;ref name="autogenerated61"/&gt;

===Tantra===
Buddhist [[Tantra]], a further development of the Mahayana, also makes use of the magician's illusion example in yet another way. In the completion stage of Buddhist Tantra, the practitioner takes on the form of a deity in an illusory body (māyādeha), which is like the magician's illusion. It is made of wind, or [[prana]], and is called illusory because it appears only to other [[yogis]] who have also attained the illusory body. The illusory body has the markings and signs of a Buddha. There is an impure and a pure illusory body, depending on the stage of the yogi's practice.&lt;ref&gt;Highest Yoga Tantra: An Introduction to the Esoteric Buddhism of Tibet, Daniel Cozort, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, NY 1986, pgs. 94-95.  {{ISBN|0-937938-32-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept that the world is an illusion is controversial in Buddhism. The Buddha does not state that the world is an illusion, but ''like'' an illusion. In the [[Dzogchen]] tradition the ''perceived reality'' is considered literally unreal, in that objects which make-up perceived reality are known as objects within one's mind, and that, ''as we conceive them'', there is no pre-determined object, or assembly of objects in isolation from experience that may be considered the "true" object, or objects. As a prominent contemporary teacher puts it: "In a real sense, all the visions that we see in our lifetime are like a big dream [...]".&lt;ref name="ChNN_dream_yoga_book"&gt;[[Chögyal Namkhai Norbu]] ''Dream Yoga And The Practice Of Natural Light'' Edited and introduced by Michael Katz, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, NY, {{ISBN|1-55939-007-7}}, pp. 42, 46, 48, 96, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the term ''visions'' denotes not only visual perceptions, but appearances perceived through all senses, including sounds, smells, tastes and tactile sensations.

Different schools and traditions in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] give different explanations of the mechanism producing the illusion usually called "reality".&lt;ref&gt;Elías Capriles.

Even the illusory nature of apparent phenomena is itself an illusion. Ultimately, the yogi passes beyond a conception of things either existing or not existing, and beyond a conception of either samsara or nirvana. Only then is the yogi abiding in the ultimate reality.&lt;ref&gt;The Yoga Tradition:Its History, Literature, Philosophy and Practice, Georg Feuerstein, Hohm Press, Prescott, AZ, 1998, pg. 164. {{ISBN|1-890772-18-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jainism==
[[File:Jain Prateek Chihna.svg|thumb|120px|Jainism]]
''Maya'', in Jainism, means appearances or deceit that prevents one from ''Samyaktva'' (right belief). Maya is one of three causes of failure to reach right belief. The other two are ''Mithyatva'' (false belief)&lt;ref&gt;JL Jaini (Editor: FW Thomas), Outlines of Jainism, Jain Literature Society, Cambridge University Press Archive, page 94&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Nidana'' (hankering after fame and worldly pleasures).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Williams (1998), Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval Śrāvakācāras, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807754}}, page 50&lt;/ref&gt;

''Maya'' is a closely related concept to ''Mithyatva'', with Maya a source of wrong information while Mithyatva an individual's attitude to knowledge, with relational overlap.

[[Śvētāmbara|Svetambara]] Jains classify categories of false belief under ''Mithyatva'' into five: ''Abhigrahika'' (false belief that is limited to one's own scriptures that one can defend, but refusing to study and analyze other scriptures); ''Anabhigrahika'' (false belief that equal respect must be shown to all gods, teachers, scriptures); ''Abhiniviseka'' (false belief resulting from pre-conceptions with a lack of discernment and refusal to do so); ''Samsayika'' (state of hesitation or uncertainty between various conflicting, inconsistent beliefs); and ''Anabhogika'' (innate, default false beliefs that a person has not thought through on one's own).&lt;ref name=robertwilliams48&gt;Robert Williams (1998), Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval Śrāvakācāras, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807754}}, pages 47-49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digambara]] Jains classify categories of false belief under ''Mithyatva'' into seven: ''Ekantika'' (absolute, one sided false belief), ''Samsayika'' (uncertainty, doubt whether a course is right or wrong, unsettled belief, skepticism), ''Vainayika'' (false belief that all gods, gurus and scriptures are alike, without critical examination), ''Grhita'' (false belief derived purely from habits or default, no self-analysis), ''Viparita'' (false belief that true is false, false is true, everything is relative or acceptable), ''Naisargika'' (false belief that all living beings are devoid of consciousness and cannot discern right from wrong), ''Mudha-drsti'' (false belief that violence and anger can tarnish or damage thoughts, divine, guru or [[dharma]]).&lt;ref name=robertwilliams48/&gt;

''Māyā'' (deceit) is also considered as one of four ''[[Kashaya (Jainism)|Kaṣaya]]'' (faulty passion, a trigger for actions) in Jain philosophy. The other three are ''Krodha'' (anger), ''Māna'' (pride) and ''Lobha'' (greed).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Williams (1998), Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval Śrāvakācāras, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807754}}, page 33&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Jain texts recommend that one must subdue these four faults, as they are source of bondage, attachment and non-spiritual passions.&lt;ref&gt;P Jaini (1998), The Jaina Path of Purification, Motilal Banarsidass. {{ISBN|81-20815785}}, pages 119-122&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
When he wishes that which is good for him, he should get rid of the four faults&amp;nbsp;— Krodha, Māna, Māyā and Lobha&amp;nbsp;— which increase evil. Anger and pride when not suppressed, and deceit and greed when arising: all these four black passions water the roots of re-birth.

==Sikhism==
[[File:Khanda Orange.jpg|thumb|120px|Sikhism]]
In [[Sikhism]], the [[world]] is regarded as both transitory and relatively [[reality|real]].&lt;ref name="Kohli"&gt;Surinder Singh Kohli, ''Guru Granth Sahib: An Analytical Study.'' Singh Brothers, Amritsar, 1992, page 262.&lt;/ref&gt; [[God in Sikhism|God]] is viewed as the only reality, but within God exist both [[conscious]] [[souls]] and [[Consciousness|nonconscious]] objects; these created objects are also real.&lt;ref name="Kohli" /&gt; [[Natural]] [[phenomena]] are real but the effects they generate are unreal. māyā is as the events are real yet māyā is not as the effects are unreal. Sikhism believes that people are trapped in the world because of five vices: lust, anger, greed, attachment, and ego. Maya enables these five vices and makes a person think the physical world is "real," whereas, the goal of Sikhism is to rid the self of them. Consider the following example: In the moonless night, a [[rope]] lying on the ground may be mistaken for a [[snake]]. We know that the rope alone is real, not the snake. However, the failure to perceive the rope gives rise to the false [[perception]] of the snake. Once the darkness is removed, the rope alone remains; the snake disappears.

* ''Sakti adher jevarhee bhram chookaa nihchal siv ghari vaasaa.''&lt;br /&gt;In the darkness of māyā, I mistook the rope for the snake, but that is over, and now I dwell in the eternal home of the Lord.&lt;br /&gt;(Sri Guru Granth Sahib 332).
* ''Raaj bhuiang prasang jaise hahi ab kashu maram janaaiaa.''&lt;br /&gt;Like the story of the rope mistaken for a snake, the mystery has now been explained to me. Like the many bracelets, which I mistakenly thought were gold; now, I do not say what I said then. (Sri Guru Granth Sahib 658).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gurbani.org/articles/webart14.htm|title=DECEPTIVE MAYA (MAAYEE MAYA CHHALL)|website=www.gurbani.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[mythologies]] the [[symbol]] of the snake was associated with [[money]], and māyā in modern [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] refers to money. However, in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] māyā refers to the "grand illusion" of [[materialism]]. From this māyā all other [[evil]]s are born, but by understanding the nature of māyā a [[person]] begins to approach [[spirituality]].

* ''Janam baritha jāṯ rang mā▫i▫ā kai. ||1|| rahā▫o.''&lt;br /&gt;You are squandering this life uselessly in the love of māyā.&lt;br /&gt;Sri Guru Granth Sahib M.5 Guru Arjan Dev ANG 12

The teachings of the [[Sikh Guru]]s push the idea of [[Selfless service|sewa]] (selfless service) and [[simran]] ([[prayer]], [[meditation]], or remembering one's true [[death]]). The depths of these two [[concept]]s and the core of [[Sikhism]] comes from [[sangat (term)|sangat]] (congregation): by joining the congregation of true [[saints]] one is [[salvation|saved]]. By contrast, most people are believed to suffer from the [[false consciousness]] of materialism, as described in the following extracts from the Guru Granth Sahib:

* ''Mā▫i▫ā mohi visāri▫ā jagaṯ piṯā parṯipāl.''&lt;br /&gt;In attachment to māyā, they have forgotten the Father, the Cherisher of the World.&lt;br /&gt;Sri Guru Granth Sahib M3 Guru Amar Das  ANG 30
* ''Ih sarīr mā▫i▫ā kā puṯlā vicẖ ha▫umai ḏustī pā▫ī.''&lt;br /&gt;This body is the [[puppet]] of māyā. The evil of [[egotism]] is within it.&lt;br /&gt;Sri Guru Granth Sahib M3 Guru Amar Das
* ''Bābā mā▫i▫ā bẖaram bẖulā▫e.''&lt;br /&gt;O Baba, māyā deceives with its illusion.&lt;br /&gt;Sri Guru Granth Sahib M1 Guru Nanak Dev ANG 60
* "For that which we cannot see, feel, smell, touch, or understand, we do not believe. For this, we are merely fools walking on the grounds of great potential with no comprehension of what is."&lt;br /&gt;[[Buddhist]] [[monk]] quotation&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?q=māyā+site:srigranth.org&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=1T4ADBF_en-GBGB267GB268&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N extracts on māyā from Guru Granth Sahib]&lt;/ref&gt;
