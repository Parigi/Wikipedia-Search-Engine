Aziraphale reluctantly agrees to work with Crowley. They decide that if each works to influence the boy Warlock, whom they believe to be the Antichrist, he will be neither good nor evil, just normal.

 | ShortSummary    = Aziraphale is ready to shoot Adam, but the weapon fires into the air when Madam Tracy cannot let him shoot a child. Learning they are two people in one body, Adam separates them. His friends defeat War, Pollution, and Famine, while Death takes his leave. Lord Beelzebub and Gabriel appear to ensure Adam re-starts Armageddon according to God's Great Plan, but he refuses. Aziraphale steps forward and asks if the Great Plan and God's ineffable plan are the same thing. Realizing they are not sure, both sides stand down. [[Satan]] emerges but is renounced by Adam, who restores the world, including Aziraphale's bookshop, Crowley's Bentley, and the lives recently lost. Found guilty of treason by their respective superiors, Aziraphale is ordered to be destroyed by a hellish flame and Crowley in a tub of holy water. To everyone's shock, both survive.

===Development===
Pratchett and Gaiman had planned to adapt ''Good Omens'' as a movie for years, with various directors and writers attached to the project along the way. In 2011, a television series, written by [[Terry Jones]] and [[Gavin Scott]], was first reported to be in the works but no further plans were announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cain |first1=Sian |title=Good Omens: Neil Gaiman to adapt Terry Pratchett collaboration for TV |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/tvandradioblog/2016/apr/15/good-omens-neil-gaiman-to-adapt-terry-pratchett-collaboration-for-tv |website=The Guardian |accessdate=January 20, 2019 |date=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Pratchett's death, Gaiman refused to ever consider working on the adaptation alone but changed his mind when he received a letter from Pratchett, written to be sent after his death, urging him to finish the project.&lt;ref name="VanityFair"&gt;{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=Joanna |title=First Good Omens Table Read Reveals Character Looks, Major Casting News, and More |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/good-omens-cast-michael-sheen-david-tennant-jack-whitehall-michael-mckean |website=Vanity Fair |accessdate=January 20, 2019 |date=September 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 19, 2017, it was announced that Amazon Prime Video had given a green-light to a television series adaptation of the novel to be co-produced with the [[BBC]] in the United Kingdom. Executive producers were set to include Gaiman, Caroline Skinner, Chris Sussman, Rob Wilkins, and Rod Brown. Gaiman was also set to adapt the novel for the screen and serve as showrunner for the series. Production companies involved with the series were slated to consist of [[BBC Studios]], Narrativia, and The Blank Corporation. Distribution of the series was to be handled by [[BBC Worldwide]].&lt;ref name="LimitedSeriesOrder"&gt;{{cite web |last=Petski |first=Denise |title=Amazon Greenlights Neil Gaiman's 'Good Omens' As Limited Series |url=https://deadline.com/2017/01/amazon-greenlights-neil-gaiman-good-omens-limited-series-1201889590/ |website=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=March 11, 2018 |date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
109 days of [[principal photography]] for the series took place over a six-month period beginning September 18, 2017 and ending in early March 2018.&lt;ref name="CompanionBook"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Nice and Accurate Good Omens TV Companion|last=Whyman|first=Matt|publisher=William Morrow An Imprint of HarperCollins Publishers|year=2019|isbn=978-0-06-289835-7|location=New York New York|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheEndandtheBeginningascmag"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fish|first=Andrew|date=June 2019|title=The End and the Beginning|url=https://ascmag.com|journal=American Cinematographer|volume=100|pages=30–44|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shooting began throughout the UK with subsequent filming taking place in and around [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="TheEndandtheBeginningascmag" /&gt; In October 2017, the production was spotted filming in [[Surrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Perryman |first=Francesca |title=David Tennant and Michael Sheen spotted filming in Surrey |url=https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/whats-on/film-news/good-omens-david-tennant-michael-13806752 |website=SurreyLive |accessdate=20 January 2019 |date=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series also filmed in [[St James's Park]] and [[Tavistock Square]] in [[London]] and [[Hambleden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/on-demand/2019-05-31/good-omens-tv-series-filming-location-guide-amazon-prime-video-bbc/ |title=Where is Good Omens filmed? | last=Carr |first=Flora |date=31 May 2019 |website=RadioTimes |access-date=3 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Soho]] area of London representing the street and Aziraphale's bookshop was created and shot in [[Hertfordshire]] at [[RAF Bovingdon|Bovingdon Airbase]].&lt;ref name="TheEndandtheBeginningascmag" /&gt;  A vacant building in [[Weybridge]], Surrey served as Heaven's Corporate headquarters and Hogback Wood, the location for Adam and his friends was also filmed in Surrey. [[Bulstrode Park]], just outside [[Gerrards Cross]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], with its mansion and grounds, was used for the satanic convent/hospital and later the corporate training center. The American Army base was located and filmed in [[Upper Heyford, Oxfordshire|Upper Heyford, in Oxfordshire]]. The [[Weald and Downland Living Museum]] in [[West Sussex]] was used to film Agnes Nutter's burning at the stake. It was shot over a two-day period in October 2017.&lt;ref name="CompanionBook" /&gt;

The car in the novel is a 1926 Bentley, but neither Gaiman nor Pratchett really knew what a 1926 model looked like when they wrote ''Good Omens''. For the television series, a 1933 model which had more of the look Gaiman had in mind was used.&lt;ref name="businessinsiderbentley"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/how-amazons-good-omens-recreated-blew-up-classic-1930s-bentley-2019-5|title=How Amazon's Good Omens' Made a Classic 1930s Bentley Drive 90 Miles per Hour through an Inferno.|last=Rodriguez|first=Ashley|date=June 1, 2019|website=Business Insider|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 16, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bentley used in filming is valued at £250,000.&lt;ref name="CompanionBook" /&gt;

===Title sequence===

''Good Omens''{{'}} opening title sequence was created by the Peter Anderson Studio, based in London and features music by David Arnold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmmusicreporter.com/2019/02/14/good-omens-opening-title-sequence-feat-music-by-david-arnold-released/|title=Good Omens Opening Title Sequence Feat. Music by David Arnold Released|last=|first=|date=February 14, 2019|website=Film Music Reporter|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Douglas Mackinnon approached Anderson about the title sequence, Mackinnon stated that he wanted something "over the top". MacKinnon's idea was to communicate the coming of Armageddon, while also showing the humor and "fantastical tone", Crowley and Aziraphale's friendship, and the idea that good and evil is in everyone.&lt;ref name="artofthetitle"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artofthetitle.com/title/good-omens/|title=Good Omens|last=Landekic|first=Lola|date=August 9, 2019|website=Art of the Title|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was a new style of design by Anderson and his studio, as well as a unique design for a television series.  Anderson described the final result as "a totally bonkers mishmash of all animation styles in a way where they feel as if they belong together".&lt;ref name="btlnewstitledesign"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.btlnews.com/crafts/peculiar-title-design-good-omens/|title=Peculiar Title Design of Good Omens|last=Kang|first=Mun|date=June 18, 2019|website=Below the Line|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="radiotimestitleeastereggs"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/on-demand/2019-02-14/good-omens-opening-credits-titles-references-easter-eggs-amazon-prime-video/|title=The Good Omens Title Designer on the Sequence's Hidden Details.|last=Failes|first=Ian|date=June 12, 2019|website=Polygon.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual production used physical props, animation, illustration, 3D and some live-action motion, to depict the approaching apocalypse and clash between Heaven and Hell.&lt;ref name="radiotimestitleeastereggs" /&gt; The goal was to include the same spirit from the show into the title sequence. Characters in the title represent "real" live-action persons from the series accomplished by dressing studio employees in the costumes from the show, filmed on green screen, and then later cutting them out and creating animations.&lt;ref name="radiotimestitleeastereggs" /&gt; Each of the animated characters has either Crowley's or Aziraphale's face.&lt;ref name="artofthetitle" /&gt;

The title sequence incorporates all the characters from the series as they move towards the Apocalypse.&lt;ref name="btlnewstitledesign" /&gt; Included are Crowley's Bentley in front of Aziraphale's bookshop, the Chattering Order of St. Beryl's nuns, Shadwell and Madame Tracy, the hellhound, flying saucers, the appearance of Death, and members of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Crowley's work on London's M25 is featured in the parade along with various towns and areas of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/on-demand/2019-02-14/good-omens-opening-credits-titles-references-easter-eggs-amazon-prime-video/|title=Sneaky Good Omens Easter Eggs Hidden in Opening Credits|last=Carr|first=Flora|date=February 14, 2019|website=Radio Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end characters fall from earth, landing either in Heaven or Hell,&lt;ref name="btlnewstitledesign" /&gt; leading into the ''Good Omens'' title artwork.&lt;ref name="artofthetitle" /&gt; The entire title sequence runs a little over one minute (1:40).&lt;ref name="btlnewstitledesign" /&gt;

===Costumes===
Claire Anderson was [[costume designer]] for ''Good Omens''. She found working on the project a unique experience unlike anything else she had done.&lt;ref name="filmschoolrejectscostume"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/claire-anderson-good-omens-interview/|title=Costume Designer Claire Anderson Talks Dressing 'Good Omens' for Success|date=2019-08-24|website=Film School Rejects|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson received a 2019 Emmy nomination for Outstanding Fantasy/Sci-Fi Costumes for Episode 3, ''Hard Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.awardscircuit.com/2019/06/21/interview-claire-anderson-on-drawing-threads-for-the-costumes-of-good-omens/|title=Interview: Claire Anderson on Drawing Threads for the Costumes of 'Good Omens'.|last=Gomez-Weston|first=Adriana|date=June 21, 2019|website=Awards Circuit|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early design centered on main characters Aziraphale and Crowley. Anderson worked closely with actors Michael Sheen and David Tennant to design their modern-day looks.&lt;ref name="CompanionBook" /&gt; Once created, they served as an important influence on everything else they wore in flashbacks throughout history.&lt;ref name="filmschoolrejectscostume" /&gt;

Crowley's look reflected his transformation into human form from a serpent. The costume was modern, black, almost "goth like" in style, including a "snake head" belt buckle.  He often wore dark glasses to conceal his serpent eyes.&lt;ref name="indiewirecoldopen"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/06/good-omens-emmys-bromance-david-tennant-michael-sheen-1202146951/|title='Good Omens': Building the Bromance Between David Tennant and Michael Sheen with Long Cold Open|last=Desowitz|first=Bill|date=June 5, 2019|website=IndieWire|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Crowley's outfits always had a hint of red, including red soles on his shoes, or red lining on his gloves representing his demon snake's red belly. Jackets contained red on the underside of his collar.&lt;ref name="metrocostumes"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/01/back-closet-david-tennant-michael-sheens-costumes-packed-subtle-angel-demon-symbolism-wardrobe-secrets-good-omens-10423540/|title=Back into the Closet: David Tennant and Michael Sheen's costumes packed with subtle angel and demon symbolism, all the wardrobe secrets from Good Omens|last=Yeates|first=Cydney|date=August 1, 2019|website=Metro.co.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=August 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aziraphale's outfits were the opposite of Crowley's, reflecting an ethereal nature.&lt;ref name="indiewirecoldopen" /&gt; His angel-inspired costumes included cuff-links, a signet ring, and a pocket watch, all containing angel wings.&lt;ref name="metrocostumes" /&gt;  Aziraphale's off-white color palette and style maintained a [[Victorian era|Victorian Era]] look through modern times with oversized lapels and shoulders representing his Angel wings.&lt;ref name="metrocostumes" /&gt;

Other costume inspirations came from the pages of the Pratchett/ Gaiman 1990 book, itself. Details described throughout were incorporated into costumes. The modern-day character, Anathema Device, distantly related to prophetess Agnes Nutter, wears a Victorian "witchy look."  Actor Jack Whitehall, playing would be witch-hunter, Newt Pulsifer was dressed with coat badges and epaulets and the accent color mustard, merging modern geeky Newt with his 17th-century ancestor.&lt;ref name="CompanionBook" /&gt; Whitehall also wanted the "odd socks" from the book incorporated into his costume.&lt;ref name="filmschoolrejectscostume" /&gt; Claire Anderson's idea for Jon Hamm, as Angel Gabriel was to look perfect. The designer found the material on Bond Street. It was "light, ethereal" and ephemeral."&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporterrichards" /&gt;  The suits were cashmere and made by Italian label, [[Ermenegildo Zegna|Zegna]]. Hamm wore lilac contact lenses to emphasize the lilac in his "pearl gray" suit.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporterrichards"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/good-omens-costume-designer-reveals-how-keith-richards-influenced-looks-1212361|title='Good Omens' Costume Designer Reveals How Keith Richards Influenced Amazon Miniseries' Looks|last=Whitlock|first=Cathy|date=May 23, 2019|website=Hollywood Reporter|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Satanic Nuns of the Chattering Order's costumes were created to look like regular nuns except with a satanic undertone. Anderson looked at nuns through the years and chose to use "peaky hats" which had a more witch-like feeling rather than an evil one.&lt;ref name="CompanionBook" /&gt; The costumes included an upside-down satanic symbol on their clothing as well their watches.&lt;ref name="metrocostumes" /&gt; The demons from Hell, Lord Beelzebub, Duke Hastur, and Ligur, wore carefully blackened clothing with shredded hems to appear as if scorched in Hell.&lt;ref name="CompanionBook" /&gt; Mr and Mrs. Young, the Antichrist Adam's parents, were dressed in a nostalgic, "timeless and comforting" 1950s look to represent their dependability. Anderson used her own parents' friends as inspiration.&lt;ref name="CompanionBook" /&gt; Sergeant Shadwell is "grubby",  wearing drab colors that reflect this. His defining look is a jacket with elements of a uniform to represent his witchfinder army role.&lt;ref name="CompanionBook" /&gt; Madame Tracy, wore costumes to reflect her dual jobs as psychic reader and "sex worker". "Flowing gowns" and colours reflecting "kookiness" were used for her mystic persona while an ostentatious kimono represented her "lady of the night" role.&lt;ref name="CompanionBook" /&gt;  Many costumes had visual effects which required putting small tape markers in the shape of green crosses on people's bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.backstage.com/magazine/article/good-omens-costumes-claire-anderson-interview-68207/|title=How 'Good Omens' Brought Neil Gaiman's Angels and Demons to Life through Costume|last=Mink|first=Casey|date=May 30, 2019|website=Backstage|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cold opening, featuring a flashback through history in Episode 3, required costumes to represent the various historical periods, ranging from the Garden of Eden in 4004 BC up to Soho, London in 1967.&lt;ref name="syfycostumes"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/good-omens-costume-designer-claire-anderson-interview|title=Emmy Contender: How 'Good Omens' Designed 6,000 Years of Costumes Packed with Subtle Angel and Demon Symbolism, all the Wardrobe Secrets from 'Good Omens'|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|date=August 16, 2019|website=SYFY Wire|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson took Inspiration from pre-Raphaelite paintings as well as hippie clothes from the movie Serpico.&lt;ref name="syfycostumes" /&gt;  Throughout the epochs each costume reflected the period as well as the Angel/Demon aspect of their characters.(2)  The scene with Crowley and Aziraphale in armor has black throughout Crowley's armor while Aziraphale's is silvery and light.&lt;ref name="metrocostumes" /&gt;  A "snake-like" skin texture is part of Crowley's costume when wearing a robe or gown in ancient times.&lt;ref name="indiewirecoldopen" /&gt;

===Special effects===
London-based Milk VFX was chosen to create all the visual effects for ''Good Omens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vfxexpress.com/good-omens-tv-drama-vfx-breakdown-by-milk-visual-effects/|title='Good Omens' TV Drama VFX Breakdown by Milk Visual Effects|last=|first=|date=|website=vfxexpress: Online VFX Animation News|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean-Claude Deguara, co-founder, began work in the pre-production, pre-script stage of the series.  During pre-production the six scripts were broken down to work out how the VFX could interact effectively with the story in each episode.&lt;ref name="artofvfxvisualeffects"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artofvfx.com/good-omens-jean-claude-deguara-vfx-supervisor-co-founder-milk-visual-effects/|title=Art of VFX 'Good Omens': Jean-Claude Deguara - VFX Supervisor &amp; Co-Founder-Milk Visual Effects|last=Frei|first=Vincent|date=June 5, 2019|website=Art of VFX|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neil Gaiman was a constant source of help as he could quote from the book to help with creative decisions.&lt;ref name="artofvfxvisualeffects" /&gt; The goal was to use an "in-camera" shot whenever possible.&lt;ref name="CompanionBook" /&gt; The [[Noah's Ark]] scene in Episode 3 used "live-action" elements whenever possible, including the smaller animals. Larger animals were added in post-production.&lt;ref name="animationmagazine" /&gt; Special effects were to be used as part of the scene and "grounded in reality" for the world and characters created, not stand out on their own. Sixty visual effects specialists, the most Milk had used on a single project, worked over a two-year period to create a wide range of effects.&lt;ref name="animationmagazine"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hogg|first=Trevor|date=April 30, 2019|title=Demonically Good Visuals|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/vfx/the-demonically-good-visuals-of-good-omens/|journal=Animation Magazine|volume=33|pages=24–25|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; 650 CG shots were created for the six episodes of ''Good Omens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animationboss.net/good-omens-vfx/|title=Good Omens VFX Breakdown.|last=|first=|date=July 24, 2019|website=Animation Boss|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Post Production turnaround time was five months.&lt;ref name="artofvfxvisualeffects" /&gt;

Deguara and his crew created a wide range of effects including creatures, environments and fire.&lt;ref name="animationmagazine" /&gt; Among the environments created was a penthouse for Heaven with "ever-changing" views of the famous landmarks of the world.&lt;ref name="CompanionBook" /&gt; The escalator to Hell was filmed in a modern office building in London, using "real time cinematography" as well as a green screen for special effects depicting Crowley's descent from the lobby to Hell.&lt;ref name="CompanionBook" /&gt;  The Soho site for Aziraphale's bookshop, built at Bovington Airfield, used a green screen to extend the streets in post-production. The site was built because Aziraphale's bookshop had to burn down with real fire, not just visual effects, something not possible to do in Soho.&lt;ref name="CompanionBook" /&gt; The opening scene of Episode 1 at the Garden of Eden, filmed in South Africa, included "many green screen and interactive VFX" to create a big visual effects scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/56338-good-omens-easter-eggs-secrets-hellhound-satan-bentley-special-effects|title=The Trickiest SFX in 'Good Omens' was David Tenant's Flaming Car.|last=Kleinman|first=Jake|date=June 3, 2019|website=Inverse|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Episode 4 featured a visual effect of Crowley (David Tennant) flying through the Internet, chased by Hastur, the Duke of Hell (Ned Dennehy).&lt;ref name="CompanionBook" /&gt; Tennant was in a rig that allowed him to "twist and roll at speed" while Dennehy used a wire. To make Tennant's part look realistic and hide the rig, digitally created "glitch-type movements" were created.&lt;ref name="artofvfxvisualeffects" /&gt;

Crowley's Bentley is almost a "character" itself in the series and is often seen racing through London at speeds above 100&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name="animationmagazine" /&gt; The Bentley had to look authentic, but no real Bentley would have been able to drive at 100&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name="businessinsiderbentley" /&gt; The filming of the car through the streets of London was one of the first effects Milk VFX learned about. After locating a real Bentley, CG assets were created for the scenes on the street as well as inside the Bentley.&lt;ref name="animationmagazine" /&gt; The car used is actually a combination of five different CG, real, and built versions. The Bentley that blew up in Episode 6 is real. The interior was removed and the exterior blown up.&lt;ref name="businessinsiderbentley" /&gt; Rather than using digital effects to create the scenery as Crowley is driving, the Bentley, Gavin Finney, Director of Photography, used an older technique called "back projection" which first films passing scenery from all the sides of a moving vehicle. On the set, the filmed scenes are projected onto a screen. Finney explains: "It means you see the footage as well as reflections on the glass or the driver’s face, say as the vehicle goes under trees, while it also works as a lighting source."&lt;ref name="CompanionBook" /&gt;

The Hellhound was created by using, as a model for the Hellhound, a [[Great Dane]] dog with similar coloring to the small dog that was used later.&lt;ref name="animationmagazine" /&gt; Using a [[chroma key|blue screen]], the Great Dane was filmed, then partially enlarged in CG to create the head and neck of a Hellhound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artofvfx.com/good-omens-jean-claude-deguara-vfx-supervisor-co-founder-milk-visual-effects/|title=Good Omens: Jean-Claude Deguara – VFX Supervisor &amp; Co-founder – Milk Visual Effects|last=Failes|first=Ian|date=July 9, 2019|website=VFXV: The Magazine of Visual Effects Society|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hellhound visual effect was used for a couple of scenes, but the transformation to a small dog used a real dog.&lt;ref name="animationmagazine" /&gt;  The final episode featured a confrontation between Adam Young, the child Antichrist, and Satan, his "father who is no longer in Heaven". The original concept of Satan was a much more "hellish" version. However, Neil Gaiman wanted a more human form of the 500-foot-tall creature, rather than including "hellfire" and over-the-top demonic action.&lt;ref name="vfxvoice"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vfxvoice.com/good-omens-making-creatures-at-the-end-of-the-world/|title=Good Omens Making Creatures at the End of the World|last=Failes|first=Ian|date=July 9, 2019|website=VFXV: The Magazine of the Visual Effects Society|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain effects were scaled back in the rise of Satan from Hell, so that the focus became the more "human" interaction between a "father" and rebellious son who rejects him as his father.&lt;ref name="varietysatan"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/features/good-omens-creating-satan-artisans-interview-neil-gaiman-1203240180/|title='Good Omens' Team on Creating the Confrontation With a 500-Foot Satan|last=Yang|first=Rachel|date=June 17, 2019|website=Variety|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sound effects such as body sounds, rocks and moving earth were used to emphasize Satan's size and power.&lt;ref name="varietysatan" /&gt; Other visual effects included a short demon named Usher, sacrificed to test holy water, a kraken rising in the sea, wings for Crowley and Aziraphale, as well as maggots overwhelming a call center when Hastur escapes after being trapped in Crowley's voicemail.&lt;ref name="vfxvoice" /&gt; Crowley's snake eyes were created using contact lenses for the most part, but were digitally enhanced when a greater effect was needed.&lt;ref name="animationmagazine" /&gt;

===Music===
Good Omens features music written by Emmy winning composer, David Arnold, along with quite a few Queen songs throughout the series. Arnold received two Emmy nominations for Outstanding Main Title theme and for the episode ''In the Beginning''.&lt;ref name="behindthelensonlinemusic"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://behindthelensonline.net/site/interviews/interview-exclusives/david-arnold-rocks-the-world-of-good-omens-with-music-exclusive-interview/|title=David Arnold Rocks the World of Good Omens' with Music -Exclusive Interview|last=Elias|first=Debbie|date=August 13, 2019|website=Behind the Lens|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold's work on ''Good Omens'' was unlike any project he had done before.&lt;ref name="behindthelensonlinemusic" /&gt; The composer said, "...it might be the hardest I've worked on anything." &lt;ref name="behindthelensonlinemusic" /&gt; Arnold describes the series as "universe-sized show in need of a universe-sized score."&lt;ref name="deadlinemusic"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/08/good-omens-composer-david-arnold-emmys-amazon-interview-1202660896/|title=Emmy-Nominated Composer David Arnold Playfully Experiments with Sounds of Good and Evil for Amazon's 'Good Omens'|last=Grobar|first=Matt|date=August 14, 2019|website=Deadline|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the composer, the opening theme is a "kind of wicked, slightly, devilish, Mephistophelean waltz-- it has a feeling of twirling, out-of-control-ness"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burlingame|first=Jon|date=June 9, 2019|title=Composers Hit Balanced Notes Between Comedy and Drama|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bft&amp;AN=136836896&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site.|journal=Variety|volume=344|pages=44|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; He re-wrote the main theme for each episode to reflect what happened in the episode.&lt;ref name="classicfmdavidarnold" /&gt;

Arnold used instrumentation in creating a particular theme for an episode/scene.&lt;ref name="behindthelensonlinemusic" /&gt;  Among instruments used are lutes, and lyres, bass brass and drums, harps and more depending on the "imagery" or "emotion" of the scene.&lt;ref name="behindthelensonlinemusic" /&gt; In composing the music, Arnold wanted to combine "heavenly" and "satanic" elements to that when something sounded good, there would also be an element of bad as well. He says, "Whenever there was a sweet violin, there would be its nasty brother lurking alongside it.&lt;ref name="classicfmdavidarnold"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicfm.com/music-news/good-omens-david-arnolds-soundtrack/|title='Good Omens': Here's Why David Arnold's Soundtrack is Literally Out of this World|last=|first=|date=May 31, 2019|website=ClassicFM|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=July 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composer was a fan of Queen's music as a teenager, studying their records and how they played sounds.&lt;ref name="deadlinemusic" /&gt; "There is a grandiosity to that music, which kind of informed what I was doing." &lt;ref name="deadlinemusic" /&gt; The choirs and a chorale sound in certain parts of the series reflected this influence at times.&lt;ref name="behindthelensonlinemusic" /&gt;

David Tennant and Michael Sheen reprised their respective roles in voice-only form for a 3-minute short titled "Good Omens: Lockdown" which was released on YouTube on May 1, 2020. The short imagines how their characters might be doing in isolation during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].&lt;ref name="Lockdown"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a32348305/good-omens-david-tennant-michael-sheen-lockdown-episode/ |title=Good Omens' David Tennant and Michael Sheen reunite for lockdown episode |work=Digital Spy |first=Stephanie |last=Chase |date=May 1, 2020 |accessdate=May 24, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing===
On October 6, 2018, the series held a panel at the annual [[New York Comic Con]] in [[New York City]]. The panel was moderated by [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and featured creator [[Neil Gaiman]], director [[Douglas Mackinnon]], and cast members [[Michael Sheen]], [[David Tennant]], [[Jon Hamm]], and [[Miranda Richardson]]. During the panel, the first trailer for the series was premiered and subsequently released online.&lt;ref name="NYCCPanel"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Roffman |first1=Marisa |title='Good Omens' Team Reveals Teaser, Discusses Show's "Fully Formed Brilliance" |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/good-omens-trailer-neil-gaiman-new-york-comic-con-1149646 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=6 October 2018 |language=en |date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Patten |first1=Dominic |title='Good Omens' Blesses NY Comic Con With 1st Teaser Trailer At MSG Panel |url=https://deadline.com/2018/10/good-omens-trailer-neil-gaiman-david-tennat-michael-sheen-comic-con-video-1202477721/ |website=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=6 October 2018 |date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[SXSW]] 2019, [[Amazon Prime]] hosted a ''Good Omens'' "Garden of Eden" Party in Austin, Texas during the entire week of the festival. The party was hosted by performers dressed as angels and demons, respectively, with free food, hair &amp; nail services, and a full complimentary bar. [[David Tennant]], [[Michael Sheen]], [[Jon Hamm]], [[Douglas Mackinnon]], and [[Neil Gaiman]] made a guest appearance at the Garden of Eden briefly before showing an episode of the series for an early screening at [[Zach Theatre]]. A party hosted at the Garden by ''Entertainment Weekly'' featured a fire-breather and a spot-on [[Queen (band)|Queen]] cover band. ''Good Omens''-branded umbrellas and tote bags were handed out at the pop-up experience, and the Garden featured a petting zoo full of local, adoptable puppies called "[[Hellhound|Hell Hounds]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/1571491/sxsw-2019-amazon-is-flexing-its-marketing-muscle-for-good-omens/|title=Amazon is flexing its marketing muscle for Neil Gaiman's 'Good Omens'|last=Rodriguez|first=Ashley|website=Quartz|language=en|access-date=2019-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Good Omens'' has received generally positive reviews from critics. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it has an approval rating of 83% based on 93 reviews with an average score of 7.25 out of 10. The site's critical consensus is, "A smörgåsbord of heavenly imagery and irreverent hilarity, ''Good Omens'' works thanks to Michael Sheen and David Tennant's very-nearly-holy (or maybe unholy?) chemistry – though, at only six episodes long, it's a rare adaptation that may have benefited from being a little less faithful to the good book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Good Omens: Miniseries  |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/good_omens/s01 |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date= December 21, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]] it has a score of 66% based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Good Omens |url= https://www.metacritic.com/tv/good-omens |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate= December 21, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petition for cancellation===
An online petition that erroneously requested [[Netflix]] cancel ''Good Omens'' has reportedly received more than 20,000 signatures from people objecting to the show's content, unaware that the show was actually on Amazon. The petition, posted as part of a "Return to Order" campaign by a US Christian organization, criticizes the show's irreverent treatment of topics relating to satanism and the devil, and the use of a female voice for God. The petition has subsequently been removed from the site, corrected and reposted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/good-omens-christian-petition-amazon-prime-netflix-1203249420 |title=Religious Group Mistakenly Petitions to Get Amazon Prime's 'Good Omens' Removed From Netflix |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=June 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/2019/06/21/good-omens-petition-christian-group-cancel-netflix-amazon-update/|title=Christian Group Admits to Error in Thinking Good Omens Was on Netflix, Redirects Petition to Amazon|website=Comicbook TV|access-date=June 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
