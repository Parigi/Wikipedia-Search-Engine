'''Gabriele Susanne Kerner''' (born 24 March 1960), better known as '''Nena''', is a German singer-songwriter, actress, and comedian who rose to international fame in 1983 as the eponymous lead vocalist of the band [[Nena (band)|Nena]] with the ''[[Neue Deutsche Welle]]'' song "[[99 Luftballons]]". In the same year the band re-recorded this song in English as "99 Red Balloons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pandora.com/#!/music/artist/nena?bio |title=Nena (Biography on Pandora) |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nena's re-recording of some of the band's old hit songs as a solo artist, produced by the co-composer of most of them, her former Nena band colleague and keyboard player Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen,  rekindled her solo career in 2002.  Combined with the success of the Nena band years, she has sold over 25 million records, making her one of Germany's most successful music artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nena.de/en/bio |title=Bio |date=1 March 2016 |website=Nena.de |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Gabriele Susanne Kerner (Nena) was born on 24 March 1960 in [[Hagen]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[West Germany]] while her family lived in the nearby town of [[Breckerfeld]]. She spent the earliest part of her childhood in Breckerfeld and later lived in Hagen. She acquired her nickname while on a vacation to [[Mallorca]], Spain with her parents. (''Nena'' is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word meaning 'little girl'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dle.rae.es/nene ''Real Academia Española''], '' nene/a''&lt;/ref&gt;) In 1977 she left high school before graduation, and in the three following years she was trained as a goldsmith.

===Musical beginnings===
Her musical career began on 2 July 1979 when guitarist Rainer Kitzmann founded the band ''[[The Stripes]]'' and, on the basis of having seen her dancing at a local disco, asked her to audition for the position of the lead singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nena.de/de/news/band-stripes |title=Inception of The Stripes band |website=Nena.de |accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thesenfitz p 13&lt;/ref&gt; The group, based in Hagen, performed songs with English lyrics and had a minor hit with the song "Ecstasy", but never achieved mainstream success and disbanded on 3 March 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nena.de/de/news/stripes-haben-sich-aufgelöst |title=The Stripes have disbanded |website=Nena.de |accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However The Stripes's record company, CBS, offered Nena a record deal if she would move to Berlin and make music with German lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;Thesenfitz p24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brendel, p52&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1982 Nena and her then-boyfriend [[:de:Rolf Brendel|Rolf Brendel]] moved to [[West Berlin]],&lt;ref name="Pop/rocky staralbum"&gt;{{cite journal |title=''Das Lexicon von Nena'' |journal=Pop/rocky star album |date=1983 |volume=Free supplement "Nena" |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they met future band members guitarist [[Carlo Karges]], keyboard player [[Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen]], and bass player [[Jürgen Dehmel]]. Together, they formed the band [[Nena (band)|Nena]].
In June 1982 "Nena" released their first single, "[[Nena (album)#"Nur geträumt"|''Nur geträumt'']]", which became an instant hit in Germany after the band appeared on the German television show ''[[Musikladen]]'' on 21 August 1982.&lt;ref name="Pop/rocky staralbum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nena.de/de/termin/musikladen |title=''Musikladen''{{snd}} ARD television premiere of 'Nur geträumt' |website=Nena.de |accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single reportedly sold 40,000 copies the day after the song appeared on the show and reached {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}2}} in the German charts.&lt;ref name="HosfeldPölking2007"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rolf Hosfeld |author2=Hermann Pölking |title=''Die Deutschen 1972 bis heute: Auf dem Weg zu Einheit und Freiheit'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7C8sAQAAMAAJ |accessdate=3 August 2013 |year=2007 |publisher=Piper |language=German |isbn=978-3-492-04927-6 |quote=''Gabriele Susanne Kerner, die sich Nena nennt, 1982 in der »ZDFHitparade«. Nena ist eine Stilikone. ... Der »Musikladen«-Auftritt bringt am darauffolgenden Tag den Erfolg: 40000 Singles werden an einem Tag abgesetzt. Auch international ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1982–1987: International success and band breakup===
In 1983, the band released its first album ''[[Nena (album)|Nena]]'', which contained the singles "''[[99 Luftballons]]''" and "[[Nena (album)#"Leuchtturm"|''Leuchtturm'']]". "''99 Luftballons''" became a number one hit in West Germany and the Netherlands in 1983 and went on to major international chart success the following year, an English version hitting {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}1}} in the UK and the original German version hitting {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}2}} in the US, behind [[Van Halen]]'s "[[Jump (Van Halen song)|Jump]]".&lt;ref name="German charts"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nena{{snd}} German chart history |url=http://www.officialcharts.de/suche.asp?search=Nena&amp;country=de&amp;x=5&amp;y=5 |website=Officialcharts.de|publisher=GfK Entertainment |accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, [[Casey Kasem]]'s radio show ''[[American Top 40]]'' introduced a "mixed" version of the song, "splicing" the German and English versions together. It was also a huge hit in many other countries, it is one of the best-known German rock songs in many parts of the world.

In May 1984 while on a tour in the UK, Nena made the headlines of the British red-top press for having unshaved armpits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wiedemeier |first1=Isabelle |title=''Haare sollen wieder wuchern'' |url=http://www.news.de/panorama/855498167/achselhaare-und-schamhaare-im-intimbereich-und-unterm-arm-haare-duerfen-wieder-wachsen/1/ |website=News.de |accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Körber |first1=Lara |title=Miley macht auf Nena |url=http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/leute/miley-cyrus/macht-mit-ihren-achselhaaren-auf-nena-40790042.bild.html |website=Bild.de |accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not uncommon in continental Europe at the time, this was considered unusual in English-speaking countries to the extent that some consider it an explanation for the commercial failure of the follow-ups to "''99 Luftballons''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Khan |first1=Andrew |title=Sounds of Germany{{snd}} day one: a history of German pop in 10 songs |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/25/sounds-europe-german-pop |website=Guardian.com|publisher=Guardian News and Media |accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baffled by the attention generated, Nena asked her manager's girlfriend to shave her and has remained clean shaved ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hairy celebrities |url=http://hairypits.livejournal.com/323361.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141107133421/http://hairypits.livejournal.com/323361.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 November 2014 |website=Livejournal.com |accessdate=27 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the "huge indignation" the issue raised, Nena, in her memoirs published in 2005, wrote, "Can a girl from Hagen, who dreams of the big wide world and is in love with [[Mick Jagger]], have no idea that girls can't under any circumstances have hair under the arm? Yes she can. I simply had no idea!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kerner |first1=Nena |last2=Thesenfitz |first2=Claudia |title=Willst du mit mir gehn |date=2005 |publisher=Verlagsgruppe Lübbe |isbn=3-7857-2135-8|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although "''99 Luftballons''" was the Band Nena's only hit in the English-speaking world, the band continued to enjoy success in several European countries in the following years. Nena's next international single "Just a Dream" (an English language re-issue of "Nur geträumt") reached {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}70}} in the UK charts in 1984; it had "Indianer" on the B-side. A dance version of "Just a Dream" was released in the 1990s to a new audience and became a club anthem. 
The band split in 1987, and Nena went solo thereafter.

===1989: Launch of solo career===
Nena's first solo album ''[[Wunder gescheh'n]]'' was released on 5 November 1989. The title track (German for "Miracles Happen"), composed by Nena herself, relates to the fact that Nena was at the time pregnant with twins, but release of the album that appeared just four days before the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] (on 9 November) and the fact that she performed the song at the end of the ''[[:de:Konzert für Berlin|Konzert für Berlin]]'' three days later has ever since associated it with that historic event. It was to prove to be her last major hit of the 20th century as throughout the 1990s her albums and singles{{snd}} although often critically acclaimed{{snd}} were less commercially successful. In 1993, following the indifferent performance of her second solo album ''[[Bongo Girl]]'', Sony decided not to renew Nena's recording contract, and the label which distributed her third, RMG Music Entertainment, disappeared shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=''Bongo Girl''{{snd}} Nena|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bongo-girl-mw0000459862|accessdate=3 December 2015|website=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=All Media Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995 Nena and her growing family moved from Berlin to Hamburg, borrowing money from a family friend in order to do so since her bank declined to extend credit.&lt;ref&gt;Thesenfitz/Kerner p240-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===2002: Return to chart success===
[[File:Nena Stadtfest-Wien2008a.jpg|thumb|right|Nena in Vienna on 3 May 2008]]
In 2002, Nena celebrated her 20th anniversary on stage with the album ''[[Nena feat. Nena]]'', a disc produced by Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen ,her former band colleague and author of almost all of the band's and her chart successes consisting of newly arranged recordings of the band's hits from the 1980s. This album marked a "comeback" for Nena, and spawned a number of successful chart entries. The remake of "[[Anyplace, Anywhere, Anytime]]" as an English-German duet with [[Kim Wilde]] was a hit in various European countries, reaching the {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}1}} spot in the Netherlands and Austria, and {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}3}} in Germany, in 2003.&lt;ref name="German charts" /&gt;

Having regalvanised her career by virtue of the band's 1980s hits, Nena reestablished herself as a force with entirely new material (produced again by Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen) with the 2005 album ''[[Willst du mit mir gehn]]'' which quickly achieved platinum status and climbed to {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}2}} in the German charts.&lt;ref name="German charts" /&gt; The first single from the album, "[[Willst du mit mir gehn#"Liebe ist"|''Liebe ist'']]", reached {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}1}} on the German charts in early 2005, and was the theme song for a German telenovela, ''[[Verliebt in Berlin]]''.&lt;ref name="German charts" /&gt; It reached the top position 22 years after "''99 Luftballons''", the longest span between first and last number one in German chart history (see [[:de:Liste der Nummer-eins-Hits in Deutschland#Künstler mit den meisten Jahren zwischen der ersten und letzten Nummer-eins-Single|''Liste der Nummer-eins-Hits in Deutschland'']]).

In October 2007, Nena released a new album entitled ''[[Cover Me (Nena album)|Cover Me]]'', made up entirely of cover songs. [[David Bowie]], [[Rolling Stones]] and [[Rammstein]] are three of the bands covered. She also released the single, "[[Young Folks#In popular culture|Ich kann nix&lt;!-- intentional misspelling --&gt; dafür]]" in April 2007 for the film, ''[[Vollidiot]]'', and her cover of "[[She's a Rainbow]]" by the Rolling Stones in the US and the UK. In 2009 she recorded and released a new version of her hit song "''99 Luftballons''", which more closely follows the 1980s original, in contrast to her 2002 version. This song was first performed in Germany on 6 September 2009. Some parts of the new version are in French.

===2009: Own record label===
Since 2009, Nena's releases have been published by her own record label, The Laugh &amp; Peas Company, which also promotes the work of her daughter's group (Adameva) and that of one of her protegé's from ''The Voice of Germany'', [[Sharron Levy]].

Nena released a new single on 18 September 2009, called "[[Wir sind wahr]]", and a new album on 2 October: ''[[Made in Germany (Nena album)|Made in Germany]]''. The autobiographical ballad from the album "[[Made in Germany (Nena album)#"In meinem Leben"|In meinem Leben]]" became her fourteenth Top 10 hit in Germany, taking her to 12th position in the all-time list of [[:de:Liste der Top-10-Singles in Deutschland|top-ten hits in Germany]], the third highest placed German act and top German female. She also collaborated with the popular techno-rap artists [[:de:Die Atzen|Die Atzen]] to produce a new single, "Strobo Pop". In 2011, she contributed vocals to the track "Let Go Tonight" by [[Kevin Costner and Modern West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nena.de/de/discografie/let-go-tonight|title=Kevin Costner feat. Nena{{snd}} 'Let Go Tonight'|website=Nena.de|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sommernachtstraum MUC 2013 10.JPG|thumb|left|Nena on stage in Munich in 2013]]

In late 2012 Nena released her 11th solo studio album, ''[[Du bist gut]]'', which peaked at {{nobr|No.{{space|thin}}2}} in the German charts, although the tracks released as singles from the album were not as successful as those from her previous albums since her 2002 "comeback".&lt;ref name="German charts" /&gt;

Nena's next album, [[Oldschool (Nena album)|''Oldschool'']], which was produced by the German rapper and hip hop artist [[Samy Deluxe]], was released on 27 February 2015.&lt;ref name="Oldschool (album) info"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Oldschool'' album credits and info|url=http://www.nena.de/de/discografie/oldschool|website=Nena.de|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distribution rights for the album were agreed with Sony Music, 22 years after the company dropped Nena as a recording artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nena signs for Sony|url=http://www.schlagerplanet.com/news/musikbusiness/nena-label-wechsel-zu-sony-music_n5479.html|website=Schlagerplanet.com|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The album maintained Nena's 21st century chart success pattern (Top 5 in Germany, Top 10 in Austria, Top 20 in Switzerland) but the first two singles released from the album failed to chart.&lt;ref name="Austrian charts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nena ''Oldschool''|url=http://austriancharts.at/showitem.asp?interpret=Nena&amp;titel=Oldschool&amp;cat=a|website=Austriancharts.at|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, for the first time in Nena's career, another track from the album ("Magie"), which was not released as a single, crept into the lower echelons of the German singles chart solely by virtue of downloads.&lt;ref name="German charts" /&gt;  Then, in April 2016, fourteen months after ''Oldschool''{{'}}s release, the third single from the album, "Genau jetzt", returned Nena to the German Top 30 singles chart for the first time in six years.&lt;ref name="German charts" /&gt;

===Since 2015: Collaborations===

The period since the release of ''Oldschool'' is the longest in Nena's career without the release of a new studio album.  In an era when artists tend to generate more revenue from live performances than recordings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Taylor Swift Tops Billboard's Top Money-Makers List of 2015 |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/list/7356755/billboard-top-40-money-makers-rich-list |website=billboard.com |accessdate=30 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wang |first1=Amy X |title=How Musicians Make Money — Or Don’t at All — in 2018 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-musicians-make-money-or-dont-at-all-in-2018-706745/ |website=rollingstone.com |accessdate=30 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nena released two live albums and restricted her studio work to one-track collaborations with [[Zara Larsson]], [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]] and fellow guests from the 2016 ''[[Sing meinen Song – Das Tauschkonzert#Season 3|Sing meinen Song]]'' series.  In February 2019 Nena provided vocals for the title track and lead single of [[Schiller (band)|Schiller]]'s album ''[[Morgenstund]]'' which entered the German album chart at number 1 and the top 10 of both the Austrian and Swiss album charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Schiller &amp; Nena "Morgenstund" |url=https://www.jumpradio.de/musik/neu/schiller-nena-morgenstund-102.html |website=jumpradio.de |accessdate=30 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Schiller Morgenstund |url=https://www.offiziellecharts.de/album-details-369646 |website=Offiziellecharts.de |publisher=GfK Entertainment |accessdate=30 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Schiller - Morgenstund |url=https://dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Schiller&amp;titel=Morgenstund&amp;cat=a |website=dutchcharts.nl |accessdate=4 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2020 Nena announced new music would be published "soon" and a month later released the single "Licht" on her 60th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Official Nena newsletter |url=https://archive.newsletter2go.com/?n2g=f4po7k9j-45e2lrcm-eeq |publisher=Laugh + Peas Entertainment &amp; Lifestyle |accessdate=21 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nena: zum runden Geburtstag neuer Song "Licht" |url=https://schlagerprofis.de/14372/ |website=Schlagerprofis.de |accessdate=24 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live performances===
[[File:Nena live.jpg|thumb|right|Nena on stage in Dortmund in May 2011]]
Since 1997 Nena has toured Germany and its neighbouring countries annually, typically performing between 15 and 50 concerts every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nena concert dates history|url=http://www.nena.de/gigografie|website=Nena.de|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Nena took the stage during the [[Howard Jones (musician)|Howard Jones]] 20th Anniversary concert at the [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]] in London to sing "99 Luftballons", with both German and English lyrics. In 2004, Nena went on stage at the [[Mayday (music festival)|Mayday Music Festival]], in Dortmund, accompanied by the techno duo [[:de:Toktok|Toktok]]. She sang the song "Bang Bang", and was later joined on stage by [[Westbam|DJ Westbam]] to perform "Oldschool Baby". In March 2015 Nena promoted the release of the ''Oldschool'' album with a "club tour" of 16 smaller venues (for 200 to 700 people) including her former primary school.&lt;ref name="Clubtour 2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nena "Clubtour" dates and setlist|url=http://www.nena.de/tour/clubtour-2015|website=Nena.de|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recording of one of these concerts{{snd}} at the [[SO36]] club in Berlin on 4 March 2015{{snd}} was released as Nena's sixth live album ''[[Live at SO36]]'' on 4 March 2016, exactly one year later.&lt;ref name="Live at SO36"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Live at SO36''|url=http://www.nena.de/de/discografie/live-so36|website=Nena.de|publisher=Nena official website|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2015 Nena announced her intention to perform live in the US for the first time by way of a similar "club tour", which was initially planned for the spring of 2016 before taking place as a 3-date "mini tour" in September and October.&lt;ref name="Ex Berliner" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nena – she's going on a 2016 US tour|url=http://www.gala.de/stars/news/starfeed/nena-sie-geht-2016-auf-us-tour_1334695.html|website=Gala.de|publisher=Action Press|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nena schwärmt von Beziehung zu Freund Phil|url=http://www.n-tv.de/ticker/Nena-schwaermt-von-Beziehung-zu-Freund-Phil-article17565896.html|website=n-tv.de|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US: Nena Delivers "99 Luftballons" to Eager Fans in her First American Tour|url=https://www.bmg.com/us/news/nena-kicks-off-american-tour.html|website=Bmg.com|publisher=BMG Rights Management|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this tour, Nena met [[David A.

Nena's 2018 "Nichts Versäumt" tour of mainly sold-out concerts in 45 towns and cities attracted in excess of 250,000 fans and won the German Live Entertainment Award (LEA) for "concert hall tour of the year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Grace |first1=Anna |title=Theatre producer Mehr-BB wins big at PRG LEA 2019 |url=https://www.iq-mag.net/2019/04/mehr-bb-wins-big-prg-lea-2019/#.XKX9hdJKhB8 |website=iq-mag.net |publisher=International Live Music Conference Ltd |accessdate=4 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nenas Jubiläumstour zog 250.000 Fans an |url=http://www.mediabiz.de/musik/news/x/433441 |website=Mediabiz.de |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concert in Dortmund on 29 June 2018 was recorded for the [[Nichts versäumt (album)|Nichts versäumt live]] DVD which was released on 9 November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NENA - NICHTS VERSÄUMT LIVE |url=https://www.nena.de/news |website=Nena.de |publisher=Laugh &amp; Peas GmbH |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work===
Besides her singing career, she has also acted in the 1983 musical comedy film ''[[Gib Gas – Ich will Spass (1983 film)|Gib Gas – Ich will Spaß]]'' (released in the US as ''Hangin' Out'') opposite fellow musician [[:de:Markus (Musiker)|Markus Mörl]], and voiced the character [[Saphira]] for the German dub of the movie ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]'' and the role of the Princess for the German version of ''[[Arthur and the Invisibles]]'' alongside [[Tokio Hotel]]'s [[Bill Kaulitz]]. Kaulitz has also stated on many occasions that Nena is his favourite singer.

[[File:Nena Dein Song.jpg|thumb|left|Nena appearing on ''Dein Song'' in 2008]]

In 2008, Nena appeared as one of the coaches on the German TV series "Dein Song", in which established artists mentor a youngster to produce a song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nena Dates 2008 |url=https://www.nena.de/termine |website=Nena.de |publisher=Laugh and Peas GmBH |accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nena was also one of the coaches on ''[[The Voice of Germany]]'' for 3 seasons before announcing her withdrawal from the show in March 2014.  In April and May 2016 she was one of the participants in the third season of [[Sing meinen Song – Das Tauschkonzert|''Sing meinen Song'']], a show in which well-known artists perform each other's songs and judge their favourites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Xavier Naidoo holt Nena zu ''Sing meinen Song''|url=http://www.dwdl.de/nachrichten/54130/xavier_naidoo_holt_nena_zu_sing_meinen_song/|website=Dwdl.de|publisher=DWDL|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Sing meinen Song{{snd}} das Tauschkonzert''|url=http://www.vox.de/cms/sendungen/sing-meinen-song-das-tauschkonzert.html|website=Vox.de|publisher=RTL interactive|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2017 and 2018 Nena appeared as a juror in the 5th and 6th seasons of [[The Voice Kids (German TV series)|The Voice Kids]] together with her daughter Larissa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nena returns to the Voice - but not alone|url=http://www.quotenmeter.de/n/88909/nena-kehrt-zu-the-voice-zurueck-aber-nicht-allein|website=Quotenmeter.de|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nena mit Tochter bei "The Voice Kids"|url=http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/tv/nena/und-ihre-tochter-bei-the-voice-kids-49924724.bild.html|website=Bild.de|publisher=Bild|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='The Voice Kids' mit Nena, Mark Forster &amp; Co. startet im Februar|url=https://www.vip.de/cms/the-voice-kids-mit-nena-mark-forster-co-startet-im-februar-4138109.html|website=VIP.de|publisher=RTL Interactive GmbH|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, jointly with her partner Philipp Palm, Thomas Simmerl, and Silke Steinfadt, she founded the [[Neue Schule Hamburg]], a school following the [[Sudbury model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Nena wrote an autobiographical book, ''Willst du mit mir gehn'',&lt;ref name="Claudia Thesenfitz 2005"/&gt; jointly with Claudia Thesenfitz, a journalist. Nena's contributions are her disparate accounts of various episodes in her life. Most of Thesenfitz's contributions are excerpts from interviews of many of Nena's friends, co-workers, and relatives.

Since becoming a mother, Nena has released a number of albums consisting of songs for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nena discography {{nobr|&amp;sect; Kids}}|url=http://www.nena.de/discografie#kids|website=Nena.de|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s she hosted several TV shows, including ''Metro'' and ''Countdown Grand Prix'', the German preselection for the ''[[Eurovision Song Contest]]'', in 1998.

In addition to citing the [[Ramones]],&lt;ref name="Look In 21/4/84"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nena's dreamworld|journal=Look In|date=21 April 1984|volume=17|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Bowie and [[Debbie Harry]] as early influences, Nena's main artistic source of inspiration and her favourite band is the Rolling Stones.&lt;ref name="Ex Berliner"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crasshole|first1=Walter|title=Nena looks back|url=http://www.exberliner.com/features/people/nena-interview-english/|website=Exberliner.com|publisher=Iomauna Media|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nena has covered their songs in concert and on her 2007 ''Cover Me'' album.&lt;ref name="Cover me"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Cover Me''{{snd}} playlist and info|url=http://www.nena.de/de/discografie/cover-me|website=Nena.de|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1984 Nena said, "If I hadn't started listening to the Rolling Stones when I was 12 I'd have been a different person, a secretary or something like that."&lt;ref name="NME 5/5/84"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corbijn|first1=Anton|title=Nena: the girl from C&amp;A|journal=New Musical Express|volume=5 May 1984|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Nena said she disliked the English version of "99 Luftballons" because it was too "blatant" and that the Nena band was neither political nor a protest band,&lt;ref name="NME 5/5/84" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Record Mirror 10/3/84"&gt;{{cite news|title=99 red herrings|newspaper=Record Mirror|volume=10 March 1984|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; she has occasionally publicly lent her name in support of political causes.  She supports "Ehe für alle" (marriage for everyone) and, as a mother of five, a campaign against the German government's plans to scale back the state provision of midwifery services.&lt;ref name=Hebammen&gt;{{cite web|title=Nena für Hebammen|url=http://www.hebammen-bw.de/nena-fuer-hebammen/|website=Hebammen-bw.de|publisher=Hebammenverband Badenwürttemberg|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nena has been a member of various charity ensembles and supergroups including "Band für Afrika" (Germany's equivalent of [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]]) in 1985 and "Marlon und Freunde" in 2006, whose Top 10 hit in Germany "Lieber Gott" raised funds for flood victims.  Nena also supports local causes and in 2015 ran (in socks) 2.5 kilometres (approximately 1.5 miles) in aid of a Stuttgart children's hospice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weil im Schönbuch: Spendenlauf zu Gunsten des Kinderhospizes Stuttgart|url=http://www.gemeindeklick.de/schoenaich/sport-freizeit/weil-im-schoenbuch-spendenlauf-zu-gunsten-des-kinderhospizes-stuttgart-d5470.html|website=Gemeindeklick.de|publisher=Nussbaum Medien|accessdate=26 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928001437/http://www.gemeindeklick.de/schoenaich/sport-freizeit/weil-im-schoenbuch-spendenlauf-zu-gunsten-des-kinderhospizes-stuttgart-d5470.html|archivedate=28 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nena is a vegetarian and won the [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] (Germany) award for "Sexiest Vegetarian of the Year 2010".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Kaulitz und Nena sind 'Sexiest Vegetarians 2010'|url=http://www.peta.de/sexiestveg2010#.VgckXGeFPct|website=Peta.de|publisher=PETA Deutschland|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She believes in Jesus and God and says that thanking him for every new day is the cornerstone of her spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nena: Jesus gibt mir Trost|url=http://www.jesus.ch/magazin/people/promis_und_religion/125010-nena_jesus_gibt_mir_trost.html|website=Jesus.ch|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nena möchte ihr Leben so spielerisch wie möglich gestalten|url=https://newsburger.de/myway-nena-moechte-ihr-leben-so-spielerisch-wie-moeglich-gestalten-87978.html|website=Newsburger.de|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From time to time suspicions of drug use have surfaced, particularly in light of Nena's high energy levels on stage. However, in his 2014 biography of the Nena band, Rolf Brendel, its drummer and Nena's boyfriend at the time said that although other band members experimented with drugs, Nena never did and frowned upon it.&lt;ref name="Bild – Brendel book"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zollner|first1=Michael|title=Nenas wilder Ex-freund packs aus|url=http://www.bild.de/regional/berlin/nena/ex-mann-rolf-brendel-schreibt-neues-buch-38213914.bild.html|website=Bild.de|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brendel added, "Nena is naturally stoned, she doesn't need to take drugs." &lt;ref name="Bild – Brendel book" /&gt;

===Personal life===

[[File:Nena Sakias &amp; Larissa Zitadelle 2018.jpg|thumb|Nena on stage in 2018 flanked by her twin children Sakias and Larissa.  Her youngest son Simeon (obscured) is behind her.]]

Nena and the band's drummer Rolf Brendel split up in 1987, Nena's feelings described in the song "[[Eisbrecher (Nena album)#"Jetzt bist du weg"|Jetzt bist du weg]]" ("Now You Are Gone") from the band's final album, ''[[Eisbrecher (Nena album)|Eisbrecher]]''. Nena then started dating Swiss actor Benedict Freitag shortly after the band separated in 1987; he is the son of the German actress [[:de:Maria Becker|Maria Becker]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glanzundgloria.sf.tv/Promis/Maria-Becker|title=Home|website=Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen (SRF)|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Austrian-Swiss actor [[Robert Freitag]]. The couple had three children together, the first being Christopher Daniel, who was born disabled allegedly due to medical mistakes made during the birth that caused Nena to go into [[cardiac arrest]].&lt;ref name="Claudia Thesenfitz 2005"&gt;''Willst du mit mir gehn'', Nena Kerner and Claudia Thesenfitz, Lübbe, 2005, page 182.&lt;/ref&gt;  He died at the age of 11 months. In 1990 they had twins, Larissa Marie and Sakias Manuel. After splitting with Freitag, Nena started a relationship with drummer and music producer Philipp Palm from [[Stuttgart]], with whom she had two children, Samuel Vincent (1995), and Simeon Joel (1997). The couple and the four children currently live in [[Hamburg]]. On Christmas Day 2009, Nena became a grandmother when Larissa gave birth to a girl, Carla Maria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klatsch-tratsch.de/2009/12/30/nena-ist-zum-ersten-mal-grosmutter-geworden/44539|title=Nena is for the first time a grandmother|date=30 December 2009|accessdate=2010-01-17|df=dmy-all|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only two days later, Nena's son Sakias became a father to a boy named Noah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article5815516/Saengerin-Nena-zum-zweiten-Mal-Oma-geworden.html|title=Zwillinge machen Nena zur Doppeloma|newspaper=[[Die Welt]]|date=12 January 2010|accessdate=2010-01-17|df=dmy-all|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/society/20100112-24523.html|title=Nena becomes a grandmother, again|date=12 January 2010|accessdate=2010-01-17|df=dmy-all|website=The Local}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third grandchild (Victor, son of Larissa) was born in September 2013 and a fourth in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nena – Enkel Victor ist da|url=http://www.gala.de/stars/news/nena-enkel-victor-ist-da_989108.html|website=Gala.de|publisher=Action Press|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nena verrät: "Ich schwimme nicht im Geld" |url=https://www.t-online.de/unterhaltung/stars/id_84772950/nena-verraet-ich-schwimme-nicht-im-geld-.html |website=t-online.de |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, Nena's twins Sakias and Larissa have appeared as backing singers on stage and on her albums, and since 2015 her youngest son Simeon has joined her on stage playing keyboards.&lt;ref name="Oldschool (album) info" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nena at your fingertips in Kreuzberger SO36|url=http://www.morgenpost.de/kultur/berlin-kultur/article138085220/Nena-ist-im-Kreuzberger-SO36-zum-Greifen-nah.html|newspaper=[[Berliner Morgenpost]]|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
