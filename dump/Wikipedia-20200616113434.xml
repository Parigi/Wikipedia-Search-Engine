The '''Cinema of the United States''' has had a large effect on the [[film industry]] in general since the early 20th century. The dominant style of American cinema is the [[classical Hollywood cinema]], which developed from 1913 to 1969 and characterizes most films made there to this day. While Frenchmen [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]] are generally credited with the birth of modern cinema,&lt;ref name=lumiere_pioneers&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lumière Brothers, Pioneers of Cinema|url=http://www.history.com/news/the-lumiere-brothers-pioneers-of-cinema|publisher=History Channel|accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; American cinema soon came to be a dominant force in the emerging industry. It produces the largest number of films of any single-language [[national cinema]], with more than 700 English-language films released on average every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/?ReportId=5538|title=UIS Statistics|last=UIS|website=data.uis.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the national cinemas of the [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] (299), [[Cinema of Canada|Canada]] (206), [[Cinema of Australia|Australia]], and [[Cinema of New Zealand|New Zealand]] also produce films in the same language, they are not considered part of the Hollywood system. That said, Hollywood has also been considered a [[transnational cinema]].&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Dale. ''Vampires, Race, and Transnational Hollywoods.'' Edinburgh University Press, 2017. [https://www.vampires-race-transnational-hollywoods.com/ Website]&lt;/ref&gt; It produced multiple language versions of some titles, often in Spanish or French. Contemporary Hollywood off-shores production to Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

Hollywood is considered the oldest film industry where earliest film studios and production companies emerged, and is also the birthplace of various genres of cinema—among them [[comedy]], [[drama]], [[Action film|action]], the [[Musical film|musical]], [[Romance film|romance]], [[Horror film|horror]], [[science fiction]], and the [[Epic film|war epic]]—having set an example for other national film industries.

In 1878, [[Eadweard Muybridge]] demonstrated the power of [[photography]] to capture motion. In 1894, the world's first commercial motion-picture exhibition was given in [[New York City]], using [[Thomas Edison]]'s [[kinetoscope]]. The United States produced the world's first [[Sound film|sync-sound]] [[musical film]], ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', in 1927,&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3457278/the-jazz-singer/|title=Why Contemporary Commentators Missed the Point With 'The Jazz Singer'|website=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was at the forefront of sound-film development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the US film industry has largely been based in and around the [[30 Mile Zone]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles]], California. Director [[D.W. Griffith]] was central to the development of a [[film grammar]]. [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) is frequently cited in critics' polls as the [[List of films considered the best|greatest film of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmsite.org/villvoice.html ''Village Voice'': 100 Best Films of the 20th century (2001)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331174817/http://www.filmsite.org/villvoice.html |date=March 31, 2014 }}.

The [[major film studio]]s of Hollywood are the primary source of the [[List of highest grossing films|most commercially successful]] and [[List of highest grossing films|most ticket selling movies]] in the world. Moreover, many of Hollywood's highest-grossing movies have generated more box-office revenue and ticket sales outside the United States than films made elsewhere.

Today, American film studios collectively generate several hundred movies every year, making the United States one of the most prolific producers of films in the world and a leading pioneer in [[History of film technology|motion picture engineering and technology]].

===Origins and Fort Lee===

The first recorded instance of photographs capturing and reproducing motion was [[Sallie Gardner at a Gallop|a series of photographs of a running horse]] by [[Eadweard Muybridge]], which he took in [[Palo Alto, California]] using a set of still cameras placed in a row. Muybridge's accomplishment led inventors everywhere to attempt to make similar devices. In the United States, [[Thomas Edison]] was among the first to produce such a device, the ''[[kinetoscope]]''.

[[File:Safetylast-1.jpg|thumb|[[Harold Lloyd]] in the clock scene from ''[[Safety Last!]]'' (1923)]]
The history of cinema in the United States can trace its roots to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] where, at one time, [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]] was the motion-picture capital of America. The industry got its start at the end of the 19th century with the construction of Thomas Edison's "[[Edison's Black Maria|Black Maria]]", the first [[movie studio|motion-picture studio]] in [[West Orange, New Jersey]]. The cities and towns on the [[North River (Hudson River)|Hudson River]] and [[Hudson Palisades]] offered land at costs considerably less than New York City across the river and benefited greatly as a result of the phenomenal growth of the film industry at the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kannapell, Andrea.

Icons from the silent era like Mary Pickford, Lionel Barrymore and Lillian Gish crossed the Hudson River via ferry to emote on Fort Lee back lots."&lt;/ref&gt;

The industry began attracting both capital and an innovative workforce. In 1907, when the [[Kalem Company]] began using Fort Lee as a location for filming in the area, other filmmakers quickly followed. In 1909, a forerunner of [[Universal Studios]], the [[:it:Champion Film Company|Champion Film Company]], built the first studio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fortleefilm.org/history.html Before Hollywood, There Was Fort Lee] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712034143/http://www.fortleefilm.org/history.html |date=July 12, 2009 }}, Fort Lee Film Commission.

In New York, the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in [[Queens]], was built during the silent film era, was used by the [[Marx Brothers]] and [[W.C. Fields]]. The [[Edison Studios]] were located in the Bronx. [[Chelsea, Manhattan]] was also frequently used. [[Picture City, Florida|Picture City]], [[Florida]] was also a planned site for a movie picture production center in the 1920s, but due to the [[1928 Okeechobee hurricane]], the idea collapsed and [[Picture City, Florida|Picture City]] returned to its original name of [[Hobe Sound, Florida|Hobe Sound]]. Other major centers of film production also included [[Chicago]], Texas, California, and [[Cuba]].

The film patents wars of the early 20th century led to the spread of film companies across the US. Many worked with equipment for which they did not own the rights to use and so filming in New York could be dangerous; as it was close to Edison's company headquarters, and close to agents the company set out to seize cameras. By 1912, most major film companies had set up production facilities in [[Southern California]] near or in Los Angeles because of the region's favorable year-round weather.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Lewis; Rise of the American film, The; Harcourt Brace, New York, 1930; p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1910, director [[D. W. Griffith]] was sent by the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph Company]] to the west coast with his acting troupe, consisting of actors [[Blanche Sweet]], [[Lillian Gish]], [[Mary Pickford]], [[Lionel Barrymore]] and others. They started filming on a vacant lot near Georgia Street in downtown Los Angeles. While there, the company decided to explore new territories, traveling several miles north to Hollywood, a little village that was friendly and enjoyed the movie company filming there. Griffith then filmed the first movie ever shot in Hollywood, ''[[In Old California (1910 film)|In Old California]]'', a Biograph melodrama about California in the 19th century, when it belonged to Mexico. Griffith stayed there for months and made several films before returning to New York. After hearing about Griffith's success in Hollywood, in 1913, many movie-makers headed west to avoid the fees imposed by [[Thomas Edison]], who owned patents on the movie-making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pederson|first=Charles E.|title=Thomas Edison|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HGnmX5WR2BAC&amp;printsec=frontcover|date=September 2007|publisher=ABDO Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-59928-845-1|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nestor Studios]] of [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], built the first studio in Hollywood in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Staff.

"The site of the Nestor Studios today is the Hollywood home of the Columbia Broadcasting System."&lt;/ref&gt; Nestor Studios, owned by David and William Horsley, later merged with Universal Studios; and William Horsley's other company, Hollywood Film Laboratory, is now the oldest existing company in Hollywood, now called the Hollywood Digital Laboratory. [[California]]'s more hospitable and cost-effective climate led to the eventual shift of virtually all filmmaking to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] by the 1930s. At the time, [[Thomas Edison]] owned almost all the patents relevant to motion picture production and movie producers on the East Coast acting independently of Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company were often sued or enjoined by Edison and his agents while movie makers working on the West Coast could work independently of Edison's control.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Bishop|Bishop, Jim]].

In Los Angeles, the [[List of film production companies|studios]] and Hollywood grew. Before [[World War I]], films were made in several American cities, but filmmakers tended to gravitate towards [[southern California]] as the industry developed. They were attracted by the warm climate and reliable sunlight, which made it possible to film their films outdoors year-round and by the varied scenery that was available. There are several starting points for cinema (particularly American cinema), but it was Griffith's controversial 1915 epic ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'' that pioneered the worldwide filming vocabulary that still dominates celluloid to this day. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

In the early 20th century, when the medium was new, many Jewish immigrants found employment in the US film industry. They were able to make their mark in a brand-new business: the exhibition of short films in storefront theaters called [[Nickelodeon movie theater|nickelodeons]], after their admission price of a [[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]] (five cents). Within a few years, ambitious men like [[Samuel Goldwyn]], [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]], [[Carl Laemmle]], [[Adolph Zukor]], [[Louis B. Mayer]], and the [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] (Harry, Albert, Samuel, and Jack) had switched to the production side of the business. Soon they were the heads of a new kind of enterprise: the [[movie studio]]. (The US had at least one female director, producer and studio head in these early years: French-born director [[Alice Guy-Blaché]].) They also set the stage for the industry's internationalism; the industry is often accused of [[Amerocentric|Amero-centric]] [[provincialism]].

Other moviemakers arrived from Europe after World War I: directors like [[Ernst Lubitsch]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Fritz Lang]] and [[Jean Renoir]]; and actors like [[Rudolph Valentino]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Ronald Colman]], and [[Charles Boyer]]. They joined a homegrown supply of actors&amp;nbsp;— lured west from the New York City stage after the introduction of sound films&amp;nbsp;— to form one of the 20th century's most remarkable growth industries. At motion pictures' height of popularity in the mid-1940s, the studios were cranking out a total of about 400 movies a year, seen by an audience of 90 million Americans per week.&lt;ref name="britannica1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-52148/history-of-the-motion-picture#508075.hook |title=History of the motion picture |work= Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hollywood Sign (Zuschnitt).jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|left|The [[Hollywood Sign]] in the Hollywood Hills has become a landmark representing the Southern California film industry.]]
Sound also became widely used in Hollywood in the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/motionpicture1.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429191100/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/motionpicture1.html |date=April 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', the first film with synchronized voices was successfully released as a Vitaphone talkie in 1927, Hollywood film companies would respond to Warner Bros. and begin to use Vitaphone sound&amp;nbsp;— which Warner Bros. owned until 1928 – in future films. By May 1928, Electrical Research Product Incorporated (ERPI), a subsidiary of the Western Electric company, gained a monopoly over film sound distribution.&lt;ref name="britannica1" /&gt;

A side effect of the "talkies" was that many actors who had made their careers in silent films suddenly found themselves out of work, as they often had bad voices or could not remember their lines. Meanwhile, in 1922, US politician [[Will H. Hays]] left politics and formed the movie studio boss organization known as the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov:8081/ammem/amrlhtml/dthays.html|title=Will Hays and Motion Picture Censorship|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization became the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] after Hays retired in 1945.

In the early times of [[talkie]]s, American studios found that their sound productions were rejected in foreign-language markets and even among speakers of other dialects of English. The [[lip sync|synchronization]] technology was still too primitive for [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]]. One of the solutions was creating parallel foreign-language versions of Hollywood films. Around 1930, the American companies{{Which|date=February 2018}} opened a studio in [[Joinville-le-Pont]], France, where the same sets and wardrobe and even mass scenes were used for different [[time-sharing]] crews.

Also, foreign unemployed actors, playwrights, and winners of photogenia contests were chosen and brought to Hollywood, where they shot parallel versions of the English-language films. These parallel versions had a lower budget, were shot at night and were directed by second-line American directors who did not speak the foreign language. The Spanish-language crews included people like [[Luis Buñuel]], [[Enrique Jardiel Poncela]], [[Xavier Cugat]], and [[Edgar Neville]]. The productions were not very successful in their intended markets, due to the following reasons:
[[File:Brown Derby Restaurant, Los Angeles, Kodachrome by Chalmers Butterfield.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Brown Derby]], an iconic image that became synonymous with the Golden Age of Hollywood.]]
* The lower budgets were apparent.
* Many theater actors had no previous experience in cinema.
* The original movies were often second-rate themselves since studios expected that the top productions would sell by themselves.
* The mix of foreign accents (Castilian, Mexican, and Chilean for example in the Spanish case) was odd for the audiences.
* Some markets lacked sound-equipped theaters.
In spite of this, some productions like the Spanish version of [[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|''Dracula'']] compare favorably with the original. By the mid-1930s, synchronization had advanced enough for dubbing to become usual.

]]
Classical Hollywood cinema, or the Golden Age of Hollywood, is defined as a technical and narrative style characteristic of American cinema from 1913 to 1969, during which thousands of movies were issued from the Hollywood studios. The Classical style began to emerge in 1913, was accelerated in 1917 after the U.S. entered [[World War I]], and finally solidified when the film [[The Jazz Singer]] was released in 1927, ending the Silent Film era and increasing box-office profits for film industry by introducing sound to feature films.

Most Hollywood pictures adhered closely to a formula&amp;nbsp;– [[Western (genre)|Western]], [[Slapstick|Slapstick Comedy]], [[Musical Film|Musical]], [[Animation|Animated Cartoon]], Biographical Film (biographical picture)&amp;nbsp;– and the same creative teams often worked on films made by the same studio. For example, [[Cedric Gibbons]] and [[Herbert Stothart]] always worked on [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] films, [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]] worked at [[20th Century Fox]] for twenty years, [[Cecil B. De Mille]]'s films were almost all made at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], and director [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]]'s films were mostly made for [[20th Century Fox]].

At the same time, one could usually guess which studio made which film, largely because of the actors who appeared in it; [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], for example, claimed it had contracted "more stars than there are in heaven." Each studio had its own style and characteristic touches which made it possible to know this&amp;nbsp;– a trait that rarely exist today.

For example, ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]'' (1944) is famous not only for the first pairing of actors [[Humphrey Bogart]] (1899–1957) and [[Lauren Bacall]] (1924–2014), but because it was written by two future winners of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]: [[Ernest Hemingway]] (1899–1961), the author of the novel on which the script was nominally based, and [[William Faulkner]] (1897–1962), who worked on the screen adaptation.

After ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' was released in 1927, [[Warner Bros.]] gained huge success and were able to acquire their own string of movie theaters, after purchasing Stanley Theaters and [[First National Pictures|First National]] Productions in 1928. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] had also owned the [[Loews Theaters|Loews]] theaters since forming in 1924, and the Fox Film Corporation owned the [[Fox Theatres|Fox Theatre]] as well. [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] (a 1928 merger between [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum|Keith-Orpheum Theaters]] and the [[RCA|Radio Corporation of America]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~hdtv/History/RKOGeneral/RKOPictures.html|title=Thumbnail History of RKO Radio Pictures|work=earthlink.net|access-date=June 19, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912042450/http://home.earthlink.net/~hdtv/History/RKOGeneral/RKOPictures.html|archive-date=September 12, 2005|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;) also responded to the Western Electric/ERPI monopoly over sound in films, and developed their own method, known as [[Photophone]], to put sound in films.&lt;ref name="britannica1" /&gt;

Paramount, who already acquired Balaban and Katz in 1926, would answer to the success of Warner Bros. and RKO, and buy a number of theaters in the late 1920s as well, and would hold a monopoly on theaters in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/united-detroit_paramount-history.htm |title=The Paramount Theater Monopoly |publisher= Cobbles.com  |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, almost all of the first-run metropolitan theaters in the United States were owned by the Big Five studios – [[MGM]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[RKO]], [[Warner Bros.]], and [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/20sintro.html |title=Film History of the 1920s |publisher=Filmsite.org |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The studio system====
[[File:Hollywood-Studios-1922.jpg|right|thumb|Hollywood movie studios, 1922]]

Movie-making was still a business, however, and motion picture companies made money by operating under the [[studio system]]. The major studios kept thousands of people on salary&amp;nbsp;— actors, producers, directors, writers, stunt men, crafts persons, and technicians. They owned or leased [[Movie ranches|Movie Ranches]] in rural Southern California for [[location shooting]] of [[Western (genre)|westerns]] and other large-scale genre films, and the major studios owned hundreds of theaters in cities and towns across the nation in 1920 film theaters that showed their films and that were always in need of fresh material.

In 1930, MPPDA President Will Hays created the [[Hays Code|Hays (Production) Code]], which followed censorship guidelines and went into effect after government threats of censorship expanded by 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=tdihArticleCategory&amp;id=3125 |title="Father of the Constitution" is born |work=This Day in History — 3/16/1751 |publisher=History.com |accessdate=June 14, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212214742/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?id=3125&amp;action=tdihArticleCategory |archivedate=February 12, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the code was never enforced until 1934, after the Catholic watchdog organization [[National Legion of Decency|The Legion of Decency]] – appalled by some of the provocative films and lurid advertising of the era later classified [[Pre-Code Hollywood]]- threatened a boycott of motion pictures if it did not go into effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maltby |first=Richard |url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2003/29/pre_code_cinema/ |title= More Sinned Against than Sinning: The Fabrications of "Pre-Code Cinema" |publisher=SensesofCinema.com  |accessdate= June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The films that did not obtain a seal of approval from the Production Code Administration had to pay a $25,000 fine and could not profit in the theaters, as the MPPDA controlled every theater in the country through the Big Five studios.

Throughout the 1930s, as well as most of the golden age, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] dominated the film screen and had the top stars in Hollywood, and they were also credited for creating the [[Star system (filmmaking)|Hollywood star system]] altogether.&lt;ref name="mediaroom1"&gt;[http://mgm.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=40&amp;cat=6]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621225003/http://mgm.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=40&amp;cat=6 |date=June 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] stars included "King of Hollywood" [[Clark Gable]], [[Lionel Barrymore]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Norma Shearer]], [[Greta Garbo]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Jeanette MacDonald]], [[Gene Raymond]], [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Judy Garland]], and [[Gene Kelly]].&lt;ref name="mediaroom1" /&gt; But MGM did not stand alone. 

Another great achievement of US cinema during this era came through [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Walt Disney Pictures|animation company]]. In 1937, Disney created the most successful film of its time, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/movies/snow/snow.html |title=Disney Insider |publisher= go.com |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction was promptly topped in 1939 when Selznick International created what is still, when adjusted for inflation, the most successful film of all time in [[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficereport.com/atbon/adjusted.shtml]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514034316/http://www.boxofficereport.com/atbon/adjusted.shtml |date=May 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many film historians have remarked upon the many great works of cinema that emerged from this period of highly regimented filmmaking. One reason this was possible is that, with so many movies being made, not everyone had to be a big hit. A studio could gamble on a medium-budget feature with a good script and relatively unknown actors: ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', directed by [[Orson Welles]] (1915–1985) and often regarded as the [[List of movies that have been considered the greatest ever|greatest film of all time]], fits this description. In other cases, strong-willed directors like [[Howard Hawks]] (1896–1977), [[Alfred Hitchcock]] (1899–1980), and [[Frank Capra]] (1897–1991) battled the studios in order to achieve their artistic visions.

The apogee of the studio system may have been the year 1939, which saw the release of such classics as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'', ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'', ''[[Only Angels Have Wings]]'', ''[[Ninotchka]]'' and ''[[Midnight (1939 film)|Midnight]]''. Among the other films from the Golden Age period that are now considered to be classics: ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', ''[[It Happened One Night]]'', the original ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'', ''[[Top Hat]]'', ''[[City Lights]]'', ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'', ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'', ''[[Rear Window]]'', ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'', ''[[Some Like It Hot]],'' and ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]''.

===Decline of the studio system (late 1940s)===
[[File:Percentage of the US Population that went to the Cinema on Average, Weekly, 1930-2000.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Percentage of the US population that went to the cinema on average, weekly, 1930–2000]]

The studio system and the Golden Age of Hollywood succumbed to two forces that developed in the late 1940s:
* a [[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.|federal antitrust action]] that separated the production of films from their exhibition; and
* the advent of [[Television in the United States|television]].
In 1938&lt;!--Snow White's premiere was in December 1937, its release was in February 1938--&gt;, Walt Disney's ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' was released during a run of lackluster films from the major studios, and quickly became the highest grossing film released to that point. Embarrassingly for the studios, it was an independently produced animated film that did not feature any studio-employed stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/paramountcase_1slump1938.htm|title = Part 1: The Hollywood Slump of 1938|last = Aberdeen|first = J A|date = September 6, 2005|accessdate = May 6, 2008|work = Hollywood Renegades Archive|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stoked already widespread frustration at the practice of ''[[block-booking]]'', in which studios would only sell an entire year's schedule of films at a time to theaters and use the [[vendor lock-in|lock-in]] to cover for releases of mediocre quality.

Assistant Attorney General [[Thurman Arnold]]—a noted "[[trust-busting|trust buster]]" of the Roosevelt administration&amp;nbsp;— took this opportunity to initiate proceedings against the eight largest Hollywood studios in July 1938 for violations of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].&lt;ref name="time-consent-decree"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,849344,00.html|journal=Time Magazine|date = November 11, 1940|accessdate = May 6, 2008|title = Consent Decree|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="part3"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://cobbles.com/simpp_archive/paramountcase_3consent1940.htm|title = Part 3: The Consent Decree of 1940|last = Aberdeen|first = J A|date = September 6, 2005|accessdate = May 6, 2008|work = Hollywood Renegades Archive|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal suit resulted in five of the eight studios (the "Big Five": [[Warner Bros.]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], [[20th Century Fox|Fox]], [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]) reaching a compromise with Arnold in October 1940 and signing a [[consent decree]] agreeing to, within three years:
* Eliminate the block-booking of short film subjects, in an arrangement known as "one shot", or "full force" block-booking.
* Eliminate the block-booking of any more than five features in their theaters.
* No longer engage in ''blind buying'' (or the buying of films by theater districts without seeing films beforehand) and instead have ''trade-showing'', in which all 31 theater districts in the US would see films every two weeks before showing movies in theaters.
* Set up an administration board in each theater district to enforce these requirements.&lt;ref name="time-consent-decree" /&gt;

The "Little Three" ([[Universal Studios]], [[United Artists]], and [[Columbia Pictures]]), who did not own any theaters, refused to participate in the consent decree.&lt;ref name="time-consent-decree" /&gt;&lt;ref name="part3" /&gt;
A number of independent film producers were also unhappy with the compromise and formed a union known as the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers and sued Paramount for the monopoly they still had over the Detroit Theaters&amp;nbsp;— as Paramount was also gaining dominance through actors like Bob Hope, Paulette Goddard, Veronica Lake, Betty Hutton, crooner Bing Crosby, Alan Ladd, and longtime actor for studio [[Gary Cooper]] too- by 1942. The Big Five studios did not meet the requirements of the Consent of Decree during WWII, without major consequence, but after the war ended they joined Paramount as defendants in the Hollywood antitrust case, as did the Little Three studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/paramountcase_4equity1945.htm |title=The Hollywood Studios in Federal Court – The Paramount case |publisher=Cobbles.com |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court eventually ruled that the major studios ownership of theaters and film distribution was a violation of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. As a result, the studios began to release actors and technical staff from their contracts with the studios. This changed the paradigm of film making by the major Hollywood studios, as each could have an entirely different cast and creative team.

The decision resulted in the gradual loss of the characteristics which made Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios, Columbia Pictures, RKO Pictures, and 20th Century Fox films immediately identifiable. Certain movie people, such as [[Cecil B. DeMille]], either remained contract artists until the end of their careers or used the same creative teams on their films so that a DeMille film still looked like one whether it was made in 1932 or 1956.

====Impact: Fewer films, larger individual budgets====
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Also, the number of movies being produced annually dropped as the average budget soared, marking a major change in strategy for the industry. Studios now aimed to produce entertainment that could not be offered by television: spectacular, larger-than-life productions. Studios also began to sell portions of their theatrical film libraries to other companies to sell to television. By 1949, all major film studios had given up ownership of their theaters.

This was complemented with the 1952 [[Miracle Decision]] in the Joseph Burstyn Inc. v Wilson case, in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] reversed its earlier position, from 1915's [[Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio]] case, and stated that motion pictures were a form of art and were entitled to the protection of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First amendment]]; US laws could no longer censor films. By 1968, with film studios becoming increasingly defiant to its censorship function, the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) had replaced the Hays Code–which was now greatly violated after the government threat of censorship that justified the origin of the code had ended—with the film rating system.

===New Hollywood and post-classical cinema (1960s–1980s)===
{{Main|New Hollywood}}
[[File:Steven Spielberg by Gage Skidmore.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|left|[[Steven Spielberg]] is considered one of the pioneers of the [[New Hollywood]] era and one of the most popular directors and producers in film history. He is also one of the co-founders of [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks Studios]].]]

Post-classical cinema is the changing methods of storytelling in the New Hollywood. It has been argued that new approaches to drama and characterization played upon audience expectations acquired in the classical period: chronology may be scrambled, storylines may feature "[[twist ending]]s", and lines between the [[antagonist]] and [[protagonist]] may be blurred. The roots of post-classical storytelling may be seen in ''film noir'', in ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955), and in Hitchcock's storyline-shattering ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.

The [[New Hollywood]] is the emergence of a new generation of film school-trained directors who had absorbed the techniques developed in Europe in the 1960s as a result of the French New Wave after the American Revolution; the 1967 film ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' marked the beginning of American cinema rebounding as well, as a new generation of films would afterwards gain success at the box offices as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/12/movies/12scot.html |work=The New York Times |first=A.

In the 1970s, the films of New Hollywood filmmakers were often both critically acclaimed and commercially successful. While the early New Hollywood films like ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' and ''[[Easy Rider]]'' had been relatively low-budget affairs with amoral heroes and increased sexuality and violence, the enormous success enjoyed by Friedkin with ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', Spielberg with ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', Coppola with ''[[The Godfather]]'' and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', Scorsese with ''[[Taxi Driver]]'', Kubrick with ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', Polanski with ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'', and Lucas with ''[[American Graffiti]]'' and ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', respectively helped to give rise to the modern "[[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]", and induced studios to focus ever more heavily on trying to produce enormous hits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Belton, John|title=American cinema/American culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qDVAAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=american+cinema+american+culture| date = November 10, 2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-338615-7|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing indulgence of these young directors did not help.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, Often, they'd go overschedule, and overbudget, thus bankrupting themselves or the studio.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The three most famous examples of this are Coppola's ''Apocalypse Now'' and ''[[One From The Heart]]'' and particularly [[Michael Cimino]]'s ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'', which single-handedly bankrupted [[United Artists]].

===Rise of the home video market (1980s–1990s)===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
The 1980s and 1990s saw another significant development. The full acceptance of [[home video]] by studios opened a vast new business to exploit. Films which may have performed poorly in their theatrical run were now able to find success in the video market. It also saw the first generation of filmmakers with access to videotapes emerge. Directors such as [[Quentin Tarantino]] and [[Paul Thomas Anderson]] had been able to view thousands of films and produced films with vast numbers of references and connections to previous works. Tarantino has had a number of collaborations with director [[Robert Rodriguez]]. Rodriguez directed the 1992 action film ''[[El Mariachi]]'', which was a commercial success after grossing $2 million against a budget of $7,000.

This, along with the explosion of independent film and ever-decreasing costs for filmmaking, changed the landscape of American movie-making once again and led a renaissance of filmmaking among Hollywood's lower and middle-classes—those without access to studio financial resources. With the rise of the DVD in the 21st century, DVDs have quickly become even more profitable to studios and have led to an explosion of packaging extra scenes, extended versions, and [[audio commentary (DVD)|commentary tracks]] with the films.

===Modern cinema===

Spectacular epics which took advantage of new [[widescreen]] processes had been increasingly popular from the 1950s onwards.

Film{{nbsp}}makers in the 1990s had access to technological, political and economic innovations that had not been available in previous decades. ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' (1990) became the first [[35 mm movie film|35 mm]] feature film with a [[digital data|digital]] soundtrack. ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992) was the first film to make use of the [[Dolby Digital]] six-channel stereo sound that has since become the industry standard. Computer-generated imagery was greatly facilitated when it became possible to transfer film images into a computer and manipulate them digitally. The possibilities became apparent in director [[James Cameron]]’s [[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]] (1991), in images of the shape-changing character [[T-1000]]. [[Computer graphics]] or CG advanced to a point where ''[[Jurassic Park]]'' (1993) was able to use the techniques to create realistic looking animals. ''[[The Phantom Menance]]'' (1999) became the first film that was shot entirely in digital.&lt;ref name=cin08&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holmlund |first1=Chris |title=American Cinema of the 1990s: Themes and Variations |url=https://archive.org/details/americancinemast00holm |url-access=limited |date=2008 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/americancinemast00holm/page/n18 2]–5 |publisher=Rutgers University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the ''[[Blair Witch Project]]'' (1999), a low-budget indie [[horror film]] by [[Eduardo Sánchez (director)|Eduardo Sanchez]] and [[Daniel Myrick]], was a huge financial success. Filmed on a budget of just $35,000, without any big stars or special effects, the film grossed $248 million with the use of modern marketing techniques and online promotion. Though not on the scale of [[George Lucas]]'s $1 billion prequel to the ''[[Star Wars Trilogy]]'', ''The Blair Witch Project'' earned the distinction of being the most profitable film of all time, in terms of percentage gross.&lt;ref name=cin08 /&gt;

The success of ''Blair Witch'' as an indie project remains among the few exceptions, however, and control of [[Big Five (movie studios)|The Big Five]] studios over film{{nbsp}}making continued to increase through the 1990s. The Big Six companies all enjoyed a period of expansion in the 1990s. They each developed different ways to adjust to rising costs in the film industry, especially the rising salaries of movie stars, driven by powerful agents. The biggest stars like [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Russell Crowe]], [[Tom Cruise]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Julia Roberts]] received between $15-$20 million per film and in some cases were even given a share of the film's profits.&lt;ref name=cin08 /&gt;

[[Screenwriters]] on the other hand were generally paid less than the top actors or directors, usually under $1 million per film. However, the single largest factor driving rising costs was special effects. By 1999 the average cost of a [[blockbuster film]] was $60 million before marketing and promotion, which cost another $80 million.&lt;ref name=cin08 /&gt;

Since then, American films have become increasingly divided into two categories: [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|Blockbusters]] and [[independent film]]s.

Studios supplement these movies with [[Independent film|independent productions]], made with small budgets and often independently of the studio corporation. Movies made in this manner typically emphasize high professional quality in terms of acting, directing, screenwriting, and other elements associated with production, and also upon creativity and innovation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} These movies usually rely upon critical praise or niche marketing to garner an audience. Because of an independent film's low budget, a successful independent film can have a high profit-to-cost ratio while a failure will incur minimal losses, allowing for studios to sponsor dozens{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} of such productions in addition to their high-stakes releases.

[[File:Hollywood boulevard from kodak theatre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Hollywood Boulevard from the [[Dolby Theatre]], before 2006]]
American independent cinema was revitalized{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} in the late 1980s and early 1990s when another new generation of moviemakers, including [[Spike Lee]], [[Steven Soderbergh]], [[Kevin Smith]] and [[Quentin Tarantino]] made movies like, respectively: ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'', ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]'', ''[[Clerks]]'' and ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]''. In terms of directing, screenwriting, editing, and other elements, these movies were innovative and often irreverent, playing with and contradicting the conventions of Hollywood movies. Furthermore, their considerable financial successes and crossover into popular culture reestablished the commercial viability of independent film. Since then, the independent film industry has become more clearly defined and more influential in American cinema. Many of the major studios have capitalised on this by developing subsidiaries to produce similar films; for example, [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]].

By this time, [[Harvey Weinstein]] was a Hollywood power player, commissioning critically acclaimed film such as [[Shakespeare in Love]], [[Good Will Hunting]], and the Academy Award-winning [[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]. Under TWC Weinstein had released almost an unbroken chain of successful films. Best Picture winners [[The Artist (film)|The Artist]] and [[The King's Speech]] were released under Weinstein's commission.

===Contemporary cinema===
Unlike in the golden age of Hollywood, where studios took risky gambles on their pictures, the contemporary industry is far more reliant on the safe marketability of film franchises. Blockbusters are now calculated and market tested productions usually based on an already popular intellectual property that has franchise potential and makes significant profits. Hollywood has moved away from creating provocative adult films in favor of producing four-quadrant blockbusters, that appeal to every possible audience. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} In the early 21st Century, the theatrical market place has been dominated by the ''[[superhero]]'' genre, with the ''[[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'' being two of the most successful film series of all time. The American market place has also seen an influx of documentaries and foreign cinema, with such popular films as; ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]],'' ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]],'' ''[[Roma (2018 film)|Roma]],'' and [[Parasite (2019 film)|Parasite]] and documentary films such as ''[[Super Size Me]]'', ''[[March of the Penguins]]'', ''[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]],'' ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]],'' ''[[Food, Inc.]],'' ''[[Inside Job (2010 film)|Inside Job]]'' and [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'' and ''[[Sicko]]''. European productions from directors such as [[Michael Haneke]] and [[Lars Von Trier]] continue to push the artistic boundaries of cinema.

==Hollywood and politics==
{{Main|Good Neighbor policy}}
[[File:81st Academy Awards Ceremony.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|81st [[Academy Awards]] Presentations, [[Dolby Theatre]], Hollywood, 2009]]
In the 1930s, the Democrats and the Republicans saw money in Hollywood. President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] saw a huge partnership with Hollywood. He used the first real potential of Hollywood's stars in a national campaign. [[Melvyn Douglas]] toured Washington in 1939 and met the key New Dealers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Political endorsements===
Endorsements letters from leading actors were signed, radio appearances and printed advertising were made. Movie stars were used to draw a large audience into the political view of the party. By the 1960s, [[John F. Kennedy]] was a new, young face for Washington, and his strong friendship with [[Frank Sinatra]] exemplified this new era of glamor. The last moguls of Hollywood were gone and younger, newer executives and producers began pushing more [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] ideas.

Celebrities and money attracted politicians into the high-class, glittering Hollywood lifestyle. As Ronald Brownstein wrote in his book "The Power and the Glitter", television in the 1970s and 1980s was an enormously important new media in politics and Hollywood helped in that media with actors making speeches on their political beliefs, like [[Jane Fonda]] against the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name="Brownstein, Ronald 1990"&gt;Brownstein, Ronald (1990). ''The power and the glitter : the Hollywood-Washington connection .'' [[Pantheon Books]]. {{ISBN|0-394-56938-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite many celebrities and producers being left-leaning and tending to support the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], this era produced many [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] actors and producers. Former actor [[Ronald Reagan]] became [[governor of California]] and subsequently became the 40th [[president of the United States]]. It continued with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as California's governor in [[California gubernatorial recall election|2003]].

===Political donations===
[[File:Highsmithmaycompanywilshire.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Academy Museum of Motion Pictures]]]]
Today, donations from Hollywood help to fund federal politics.&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes-20070206"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/06/movies/awardsseason/06holly.html|title=Politicians Are Doing Hollywood Star Turns|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 5, 2008 |first=David M. |last=Halbfinger |date=February 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 20, 2007, for example, Democratic then-presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] had a $2,300-a-plate Hollywood gala, being hosted by [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] founders [[David Geffen]], [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], and [[Steven Spielberg]] at the Beverly Hilton.&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes-20070206" /&gt;

===Censorship===
Hollywood producers generally seek to comply with the [[Chinese government]]'s censorship requirements in a bid to access the country's restricted and lucrative cinema market,&lt;ref name="wp-8oct2019"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Whalen |first1=Jeanne |title=China lashes out at Western businesses as it tries to cut support for Hong Kong protests |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/08/china-lashes-out-western-businesses-it-tries-cut-support-hong-kong-protests/ |work=Washington Post |date=8 October 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the second-largest box office in the world as of 2016. This includes prioritizing sympathetic portrayals of Chinese characters in movies, such as changing the villains in ''[[Red Dawn (2012 film)|Red Dawn]]'' from Chinese to North Koreans.&lt;ref name="wp-8oct2019" /&gt; Due to many topics forbidden in China, such as Dalai Lama and [[Winnie-the-Pooh#Censorship in China|Winnie-the-Pooh]] being involved in the [[South Park]]'s episode "[[Band in China]]", South Park was entirely banned in China after the episode's broadcast.&lt;ref name="pooh"&gt;{{cite news |title=South Park ban by China highlights Hollywood tightrope act |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/south-park-ban-china-highlights-hollywood-tightrope-act-191010180426697.html |work=Al-Jazeera |date=10 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2018 film ''[[Christopher Robin (film)|Christopher Robin]]'', the new Winnie-the-Pooh movie, was denied a Chinese release.&lt;ref name="pooh"/&gt; 

Although [[Tibet]] was previously a [[cause célèbre]] in Hollywood, featuring in films including ''[[Kundun]]'' and ''[[Seven Years in Tibet]]'', in the 21st century this is no longer the case.&lt;ref name="qz-tibet-2019"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Steger |first1=Isabella |title=Why it’s so hard to keep the world focused on Tibet |url=https://qz.com/1565178/how-china-has-shrunk-global-attention-for-tibet-and-the-dalai-lama/ |work=Quartz |date=28 March 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[Marvel Entertainment]] attracted criticism for its decision to cast Tilda Swinton as "The Ancient One" in the film adaptation ''[[Doctor Strange]]'', using a white woman to play a traditionally Tibetan character.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/features/marvel-is-censoring-films-for-china-and-you-probably-didnt-even-notice/|title=Marvel is censoring films for China, and you probably didn't even notice|last=Bisset|first=Jennifer|date=November 1, 2019|work=[[CNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor and high-profile Tibet supporter [[Richard Gere]] stated that he was no longer welcome to participate in mainstream Hollywood films after criticizing the Chinese government and calling for a boycott of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing.&lt;ref name="qz-tibet-2019" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hr-gere-2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Siegel |first1=Tatiana |title=Richard Gere's Studio Exile: Why His Hollywood Career Took an Indie Turn |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/richard-geres-studio-exile-why-his-hollywood-career-took-an-indie-turn-992258 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=18 April 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread to world markets==

In 1912, American film companies were largely immersed in the competition for the domestic market. It was difficult to satisfy the huge demand for films created by the [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]] boom. [[Motion Picture Patents Company]] members such as [[Edison Studios]], also sought to limit competition from French, Italian, and other imported films. Exporting films, then, became lucrative to these companies. [[Vitagraph Studios]] was the first American company to open its own distribution offices in Europe, establishing a branch in London in 1906, and a second branch in Paris shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Thompson|first=Kristin|title=Film History: An Introduction|year=2010 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location= Madison, Wisconsin|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other American companies were moving into foreign markets as well, and American distribution abroad continued to expand until the mid-1920s. Originally, a majority of companies sold their films indirectly. However, since they were inexperienced in overseas trading, they simply sold the foreign rights to their films to foreign distribution firms or export agents. Gradually, London became a center for the international circulation of US films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Kristin|title=Film History: An Introduction|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Madison, Wisconsin|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many British companies made a profit by acting as the agents for this business, and by doing so, they weakened British production by turning over a large share of the UK market to American films. By 1911, approximately 60 to 70 percent of films imported into Great Britain were American. The United States was also doing well in Germany, Australia, and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson |first=Kristin |title=Film History: An Introduction|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Madison, Wisconsin |isbn=978-0-07-338613-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, as globalization has started to intensify, and the United States government has been actively promoting free trade agendas and trade on cultural products, Hollywood has become a worldwide cultural source. The success on Hollywood export markets can be known not only from the boom of American multinational media corporations across the globe but also from the unique ability to make big-budget films that appeal powerfully to popular tastes in many different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With globalization, movie production has been clustered in Hollywood for several reasons: the United States has the largest single home market in dollar terms, entertaining and highly visible Hollywood movies have global appeal, and the role of English as a universal language contributes to compensating for higher fixed costs of production.

In the meantime, Hollywood has moved more deeply into Chinese markets, although influenced by China's censorship. Films made in China are censored, strictly avoiding themes like "ghosts, violence, murder, horror, and demons." Such plot elements risk being cut. Hollywood has had to make "approved" films, corresponding to official Chinese standards, but with aesthetic standards sacrificed to box office profits. Even Chinese audiences found it boring to wait for the release of great American movies dubbed in their native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shirey |first=Paul |url=http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/cmon-hollywood-is-hollywood-going-to-start-being-made-in-china |title=C'mon Hollywood: Is Hollywood going to start being Made in China?  |publisher=JoBlo.com |date=April 9, 2013  |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's representation in film has been an issue almost as long as film has been an industry. Women are portrayed as dependent on other characters, motherly and domestic figures who stay at home, over-emotional, and confined to low-status jobs when compared to enterprising and ambitious male characters. With this, women are underrepresented and continually cast and stuck in gender stereotypes. 

Women are statistically underrepresented in creative positions in the center of the US film industry, [[Hollywood]]. This underrepresentation has been called the "[[celluloid ceiling]]", a variant on the [[employment discrimination]] term "[[glass ceiling]]". In 2013, the "...top-paid actors...made 2½ times as much money as the top-paid actresses."&lt;ref name="slate.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/02/23/gender_wage_gap_in_hollywood_it_s_very_very_wide.html|title=Gender wage gap in Hollywood: It's very, very wide.|author=Betsy Woodruff|date=February 23, 2015|work=Slate Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[O]lder [male] actors make more than their female equals" in age, with "female movie stars mak[ing] the most money on average per film at age 34 while male stars earn the most at 51."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/study-female-movie-stars-earn-significantly-less-after-age-34-1201091967/|title=Female Movie Stars Experience Earnings Plunge After Age 34 – Variety|author=Maane Khatchatourian|work=Variety|date=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 Celluloid Ceiling Report conducted by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at [[San Diego State University]] collected a list of statistics gathered from "2,813 individuals employed by the 250 top domestic grossing films of 2012."&lt;ref name="SanDiego"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lauzen|first=Martha|title=The Celluloid Ceiling: Behind-the-Scenes Employment of Women on the Top 250 Films of 012|url=http://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/files/2012_Celluloid_Ceiling_Exec_Summ.pdf|work=The Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film|publisher=San Diego State University|accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women represented only 36 percent of major characters in film in 2018 – a one percent decline from the 37 percent recorded in 2017. In 2019, that percentage increased to 40 percent. Women account for 51 percent of moviegoers.  However, when it comes to key jobs like director and cinematographer, men continue to dominate.
For the Academy Award nominations, only five women have ever been nominated for Best Director, but none have ever won in that category in the past 92 years. 
While female representation has improved, there is work yet to be done with regards to the diversity among those females. The percentage of black female characters went from 16 percent in 2017 to 21 percent in 2018. The representation of Latina actresses, however, decreased to four percent over the past year, three percentage points lower than the seven percent achieved in 2017. 

Women accounted for...
* "18% of all directors, executive producers, producers, writers, cinematographers, and editors. This reflected no change from 2011 and only a 1% increase from 1998."&lt;ref name=SanDiego /&gt;
* "9% of all directors."&lt;ref name=SanDiego /&gt;
* "15% of writers."&lt;ref name=SanDiego /&gt;
* "25% of all producers."&lt;ref name=SanDiego /&gt;

A ''New York Times'' article stated that only 15% of the top films in 2013 had women for a lead acting role.&lt;ref name="NYTstudy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Buckley|first=Cara|title=Only 15 Percent of Top Films in 2013 Put Women in Lead Roles, Study Finds|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/11/only-15-percent-of-top-films-in-2013-put-women-in-lead-roles-study-finds|work=New York Times|accessdate=2014-03-12|date=March 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the study noted that "The percentage of female speaking roles has not increased much since the 1940s when they hovered around 25 percent to 28 percent." "Since 1998, women's representation in behind-the-scenes roles other than directing has gone up just 1 percent." Women "...directed the same percent of the 250 top-grossing films in 2012 (9 percent) as they did in 1998."&lt;ref name="slate.com" /&gt;

==Diversity in Cinema==
Though the classic era of American Cinema is dominated predominantly by caucasian people in front of and behind the camera, minorities and people of color have managed to carve their own pathways to getting their films on the screen. [[African-American representation in Hollywood]] improved drastically towards the end of the 20th century after the fall of the studio system, as filmmakers like [[Spike Lee]] and [[John Singleton]] were able to represent the African American experience like none had on screen before, whilst actors like [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Will Smith]] became massively successful box office draws. In the last few decades, minority filmmakers like [[Ryan Coogler]], [[Ava DuVernay]] and [[F Gary Gray]] have been given the creative reigns to major tentpole productions.{{fact|date=May 2020}}  

American cinema has often reflected and propagated [[Stereotype|negative stereotypes]] towards foreign nationals and ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Kevin|date=January 2008|title="The Little State Department": Hollywood and the MPAA's Influence on U.S. Trade Relations|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1671&amp;context=njilb|journal=Northwestern Journal of International Law &amp; Business|volume= 28| issue = 2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In old Hollywood, when racial prejudices were socially acceptable, it was not uncommon for white actors to wear black face and [[Latin America]]ns are largely depicted as sexualized figures such as the Latino [[Machismo|macho]] or the Latina vixen, [[gang]] members, (illegal) immigrants, or entertainers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Davison |first1= Heather K. |last2= Burke |first2= Michael J. |year= 2000 |title= Sex Discrimination in Simulated Employment Contexts: A Meta-analytic Investigation |journal= Journal of Vocational Behavior |volume= 56 |issue= 2 |pages= 225–248 |doi= 10.1006/jvbe.1999.1711 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russians]] and [[Russian Americans]] are usually portrayed as brutal mobsters, ruthless agents and villains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Will the cliche of the 'Russian baddie' ever leave our screens? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jul/10/will-cliche-russian-baddie-ever-leave-screens-james-norton-mcmafia |work=The Guardian |date=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/10/14/russian-film-industry-and-hollywood-uneasy-with-one-another/ Russian film industry and Hollywood uneasy with one another]."
