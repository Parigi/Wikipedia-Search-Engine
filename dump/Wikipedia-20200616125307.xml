{{Ranks of Nobility}}
'''Sir''' is a formal [[English language|English]] [[honorific address]] for [[men]], derived from ''[[Sire]]'' in the [[High Middle Ages]]. Traditionally, as governed by [[law]] and custom, Sir is used for men titled [[knight]]s i.e. of [[order of chivalry|orders of chivalry]], and later also to [[baronet]]s, and other offices. As the [[female]] equivalent for knighthood is damehood, the ''[[suo jure]]'' female equivalent term is typically [[Dame]]. The [[wife]] of a knight or baronet tends to be addressed [[Lady]], although a few exceptions and interchanges of these uses exist. 

Since the Late Modern era, "Sir" has been increasingly used also as a respectful way to address any [[commoner]]s of a superior [[social status]] or [[military rank]]. Equivalent terms of address for women are [[Madam]] (shortened "Ma'am"), in addition to social honorifics such as [[Mr]], [[Mrs]], [[Miss]], and [[Mx (title)]].

==Etymology==
''Sir'' derives from the honorific title ''[[sire]]''; ''sire'' developed alongside the word ''seigneur'', also used to refer to a feudal lord. Both derived from the [[Vulgar Latin]] {{small caps|senior}}, ''sire'' comes from the [[nominative case]] declension {{smallcaps|senior}} and ''seigneur'', the [[accusative case]] declension {{small caps|seniōrem}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of the French Language Through Texts|last=Ayres-Bennet|first=Wendy|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0415099994|section=The 'heyday' of Old French (French in the 12th and 13th centuries)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form 'Sir' is first documented in [[English language|English]] in 1297, as title of honour of a knight, and latterly a [[baronet]], being a variant of ''sire'', which was already used in English since at least c.1205 as a title placed before a name and denoting knighthood, and to address the (male) Sovereign since c.1225, with additional general senses of 'father, male parent' is from c.1250, and 'important elderly man' from 1362.

===Commonwealth of Nations===
[[File:Sir Thomas Troubridge, 1st Baronet.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir [[Thomas Troubridge, 1st Baronet]], whose entitlement to use 'Sir' derived from his position as baronet]]
The prefix is used with the holder's given name or full name, but never with the surname alone. For example, whilst Sir Alexander and Sir [[Alexander Fleming]] would be correct, Sir Fleming would not.&lt;ref name="Debretts: Knight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/knight|title=Knight|accessdate=2 February 2015|date=n.d.|publisher=Debretts|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205112936/http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/knight|archivedate=5 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equivalent for a female who holds a knighthood or baronetcy in her own right is '[[Dame (title)|Dame]]', and follows the same usage customs as 'Sir'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/baronet/baronetess|title=Baronetess|publisher=[[Debretts]]|accessdate=2 February 2014|date=n.d.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204031739/http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/baronet/baronetess|archivedate=4 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this form was previously also used for the wives of knights and baronets, it is now customary to refer to them as 'Lady', followed by their surname; they are never addressed using their full names. For example, while Lady Fiennes is correct, Lady Virginia and Lady Virginia Fiennes are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family of a Baronet|publisher=Debretts|url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/baronet/family-baronet|accessdate=2 February 2015|date=n.d.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315235601/http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/baronet/family-baronet|archivedate=15 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Debretts: Wife of a Knight"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wife of a Knight|url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/knight/wife-knight|publisher=Debretts|accessdate=2 February 2015|date=n.d.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221194925/http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/knight/wife-knight|archivedate=21 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The widows of knights retain the style of wives of knights,&lt;ref name="Debretts: Wife of a Knight"/&gt; however widows of baronets are either referred to as 'dowager', or use their forename before their courtesy style. For example, the widow of Sir [[Troubridge baronets|Thomas Herbert Cochrane Troubridge, 4th Baronet]], would either be known as ''Dowager Lady Troubridge'' or ''Laura, Lady Troubridge''.&lt;ref name="Debretts: Wife of a Baronet"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Debretts|title=Wife of a Baronet|url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/baronet/widow-and-former-wife-baronet|accessdate=2 February 2015|date=n.d.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316013044/http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/baronet/widow-and-former-wife-baronet|archivedate=16 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Emperor Taisho the Order of the Garter.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emperor Taishō]], a Stranger Knight of the [[Order of the Garter]], who, as a foreign national, was not entitled to use the prefix 'Sir' (which as a sovereign monarch he would not have used in any case) but was permitted to post-nominally use {{smallcaps|KG}}]]
Today, in the UK and in certain Commonwealth [[Commonwealth realm|realms]], a number of men are entitled to the prefix of 'Sir', including [[knights bachelor]], knights of the [[orders of chivalry]] and [[baronets]]; although foreign nationals can be awarded honorary knighthoods. Honorary knights do not bear the prefix "Sir" nor do they receive an [[accolade]]; instead they use the associated [[post-nominal letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.debretts.com/expertise/essential-guide-to-the-peerage/the-knightage/|title=Honorary Knighthood|last=|first=|date=n.d.|website=|publisher=Debretts|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Church of England]] clergy who receive knighthoods do also not receive an accolade and therefore do not use the title 'Sir', but instead refer to their knighthood using post-nominal letters.&lt;ref name="Debretts: Knight"/&gt; For example, the Reverend [[John Polkinghorne]], [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] is never referred to as ''Sir John Polkinghorne''. Clergy of other denominations may use different conventions.&lt;ref name="Debretts: Knight"/&gt;

[[Multiple citizenship|Dual nationals]] holding a Commonwealth citizenship that recognise the British [[monarch]] as head of state are entitled to use the styling. Common usage varies from country to country: for instance, dual [[Bahamas|Bahamian]]-American citizen [[Sidney Poitier]], knighted in 1974, is often styled 'Sir Sidney Poitier', particularly in connection with his official [[ambassador]]ial duties, although he himself rarely employs the title.

The permissibility of using the style of 'Sir' varies. In general, only dynastic knighthoods in the personal gift of the Sovereign and Head of the Commonwealth – the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle and the knighthoods in the Royal Victorian Order – are recognised across the Commonwealth realms, along with their accompanying styles.

Knighthoods in the gift of the government of a Commonwealth realm typically only permit the bearer to use his title within that country or as its official representative, provided he is a national of that country; Commonwealth realms may consider knighthoods from other realms to only be foreign honours. For instance, [[Anthony Bailey (PR advisor)|Anthony Bailey]] was reprimanded by Buckingham Palace and the British government in 2016 for asserting that an honorary Antiguan knighthood allowed him the style of 'Sir' in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/2547848 London Gazette], 1 June 2016, accessed 16 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Something of the Knight...", ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'', no, 1420, 10 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mail_20160528"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donovan|first1=Ned|last2=Gallagher|first2=Ian|title=Queen's envoy 'Baroness Brazen' is entangled in honours scandal: Title given to Commonwealth chief's crony is 'reviewed' after she is accused of abusing the system|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3614462/Queen-s-envoy-honours-scandal-Title-given-Commonwealth-chief-s-crony-reviewed-amid-Palace-fury.html|accessdate=16 August 2016|work=[[The Daily Mail]]|date=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Saint Lucia====
* Knight Commander of the [[Order of Saint Lucia]] (KCSL)

=== Holy See ===
Knights and Dames of [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the Holy See|papal orders]] may elect the "Sir" or "Dame" prefix with post-nominal letters. The [[Pope]], the [[sovereign]] of the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Vatican City]], delegates the awarding [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the Holy See|orders of knighthood]] to [[Bishop in the Catholic Church|bishops]] and [[Grand master (order)|Grand Masters]]. Their precedence is as follows:

* [[Supreme Order of Christ]] (Vacant)
* [[Order of the Golden Spur]] (Vacant)
* [[Order of Pope Pius IX]]
* [[Order of St. Gregory the Great]]
* [[Order of St. Sylvester]]
* [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]]
* [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]

For Example, [[Burton P. C. Hall|Sir Burton P. C. Hall]], [[Order of St. Sylvester|KSS]], [[Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre|KHS]] would be the correct style for lay knights. 

Lieutenants of the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]], are styled as "Your Excellency", such as H.E. [[Dame Trudy Comeau]], [[Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre|DC*HS]]. 

Catholic clergy who are invested as Knight Chaplains may use post-nominal letters, but must retain their clerical titles, like [[Robert Skeris|Rev. Robert Skeris]], [[Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre|KCHS]].

===Ireland===
Established in 1783 and primarily awarded to men associated with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], Knights of the [[Order of St. Patrick]] were entitled to the style of 'Sir'.  Regular creation of new knights of the order ended in 1921 upon the formation of the [[Irish Free State]]. With the death of the last knight in 1974, the Order became dormant.

===India===
[[Image:King Of Travancore sct.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma]] was the last surviving Knight Grand Commander of the [[Order of the Star of India]]]]

As part of the consolidation of the [[British Raj|crown colony of India]], the [[Order of the Star of India]] was established in 1861 to reward prominent British and Indian civil servants, military officers and prominent Indians associated with the Indian Empire. The [[Order of the Indian Empire]] was established in 1878 as a junior-level order to accompany the Order of the Star of India, and to recognise long service.

From 1861 to 1866, the Order of the Star of India had a single class of Knights (KSI), who were entitled to the style of 'Sir'. In 1866, the order was reclassified into three divisions: Knights Grand Commander (GCSI), Knights Commander (KCSI) and Companions (CSI); holders of the upper two degrees could use the title 'Sir'. From its creation in 1878 until 1887, the Order of the Indian Empire had a single class, Companion (CIE), which did not entitle the recipient to a style of knighthood.

In 1887, two higher divisions, Knight Grand Commander (GCIE) and Knight Commander (KCIE) were created, which entitled holders of those ranks to the style of 'Sir'. The last creations of knights of either order were made on 15 August 1947 upon Indian independence. All British honours and their accompanying styles were officially made obsolete in India when the [[Dominion of India]] became a modern [[Commonwealth republic]] in 1950, followed by [[Islamic Republic of Pakistan]] in 1956.

The Order of the Star of India became dormant in the Commonwealth realms from February 2009, and the Order of the Indian Empire after August 2010, when the last knights of the orders died.

=== Nigeria ===
In [[Nigeria]], holders of religious [[Order (distinction)|honours]] like the [[Knighthood of St. Gregory]] make use of the word as a pre-nominal honorific in much the same way as it is used for secular purposes in Britain and the Philippines. Wives of such individuals also typically assume the title of Lady.

=== Philippines ===
As a privilege of the members of the Order of the [[Knights of Rizal]], the prefix "Sir" is attached to their forenames while wives of Knights add the prefix "Lady" to their first names.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://freiherrvonquast.wordpress.com/2015/10/25/who-is-entitled-to-the-prefix-of-sir/|title=Who is entitled to the prefix of ‘Sir’?|date=2015-10-25|work=R.A.U. Juchter van Bergen Quast, LLM|access-date=2017-12-06|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt; These apply to both spoken and written forms of address.

Among the notable members of the Knights of Rizal include [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos I of Spain]] who was conferred a Knight Grand Cross of Rizal on 11 February 1998. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobilitynews.blogspot.com/2015/04/entitlement-to-prefix-of-sir.html|title=Entitlement to the prefix of &amp;#39;sir&amp;#39;|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combinations with other titles and styles===
;Military
In the case of a military officer who is also a knight, the appropriate form of address puts the professional military rank first, then the correct manner of address for the individual, then his name. Examples include:
* [[Admiral of the Fleet (United Kingdom)|Admiral of the Fleet]] [[Bruce Fraser, 1st Baron Fraser of North Cape|Sir Bruce Fraser]], [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath|GCB]], [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|KBE]] (after 1941)&lt;ref&gt;Royal Navy Flag Officers, 1904-1945: [http://www.admirals.org.uk/admirals/fleet/fraserba.php Admiral of the Fleet Sir Bruce Fraser], admirals.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Field Marshal (Australia)|Field Marshal]] [[Thomas Blamey|Sir Thomas Blamey]], [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire|GBE]], [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath|KCB]], [[Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]], [[Companion of the Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Efficiency Decoration|ED]] (after 1941)&lt;ref&gt;Australian Dictionary of Biography: [http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130231b.htm Field Marshal Sir Thomas Albert Blamey], adb.online.anu.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt;

;Academic
This is also the case with academic ranks and titles, such as '[[Professor]]'. For example, [[Patrick Bateson]] was both a professor&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Note a difference in usage between British and US usage. A Professor in the UK is only used for the highest academic rank. See [[List of words having different meanings in American and British English (M–Z)#P|a summary here]].&lt;/ref&gt; and a knight bachelor; his correct title would be Professor Sir Patrick Bateson. However, the title of '[[Doctor (title)|Doctor]]' (Dr.) is not used in combination with 'Sir', with the knighthood taking precedence. Knighted doctors are addressed as knights, though they may still use any post-nominal letters associated with their degrees.

;Peers
Peers who have been knighted are not addressed as 'Sir' in the formal sense of the style, as their titles of nobility take precedence. If the heir apparent to a dukedom, marquessate or earldom holds a courtesy title and has been knighted, the same principle applies to him, as well as to the male heirs of a duke or a marquess, who are styled 'Lord' followed by their first name. For instance, diplomat Lord [[Nicholas Gordon-Lennox]], KCMG, KCVO, who was a younger son of the [[Duke of Richmond]], continued to be styled as 'Lord Nicholas' following his knighthood in 1986, not 'Lord Sir Nicholas'. Other male heirs of an earl who lack courtesy titles, and the male heirs of a viscount or baron, do however use the style of 'Sir' if knighted, the style following that of 'The Hon'.

==Educational, military and other usage==

===Education system===
'Sir', along with 'Miss' for females, is commonly used in the British school system to address teachers; and or members of faculty as well as staff.  Usage of these terms is considered a mark of respect, and can be dated back to the 16th century. The practice may have been an attempt to reinforce the authority of teachers from lower social classes among classes of largely upper class students.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10827710/Stop-calling-teachers-Miss-or-Sir-pupils-are-told.html|title=Stop calling teachers 'Miss' or 'Sir', pupils are told|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]|date=13 May 2014|last=Paton|first=Graeme|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jennifer Coates, emeritus professor of English language and linguistics at [[Roehampton University]] has criticised the use of the title for male teachers, saying that "Sir is a knight.  There weren't women knights, but 'Miss' is ridiculous: it doesn't match 'Sir' at all.  It's just one of the names you can call an unmarried woman", and that "It's a depressing example of how women are given low status and men, no matter how young or new in the job they are, are given high status".&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"/&gt;  This view is not unchallenged however.  The chief executive of the [[Brook Learning Trust]], Debbie Coslett, said "... they call me 'Miss', I'm fine with that.  They're showing respect by giving me a title rather than 'hey' or 'oi, you' or whatever", and dismissed the male/female issue as "That's just the way the English language works".&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"/&gt;

In the [[Southern United States]], the term 'sir' is often used to address someone in a position of authority or respect, and is commonly used in schools and universities by students to address their teachers and professors.  Whereas the British and Commonwealth female equivalent is ''Miss'', students will often refer to female teachers as ''Ma'am''.&lt;ref name="Teachers"&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding English Language Variation in U.S. Schools|last1=Hudley|last2=Mallinson|first1=Anne|first2=Christine|section=A Regional and Cultural Variety|year=2011|publisher=Teachers College Press|location=NY, USA|isbn=9780807751480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Northeast United States]], particularly [[New England]], there remains influence of both the British and French traditions as noted above; in general parlance, teachers, authority-figures, and so forth, are referred to by a title of respect such as 'Sir' for males and 'Miss, Ms, or Mrs' for females: 'Miss' for unmarried, younger females; 'Ms' for senior, elder, or ranking females that may or may not be married (see article Ms/Mrs/Miss); and 'Mrs' for married or widowed females. The predominant form of address remains "Sir/Ma'am", though in some sectors - such as service, hospitality, or politics - "Sir/Madam(e)" prevails, while in Northern Maine - [[Aroostock County]] and [[St John's Valley]] - most female teachers or public officials, regardless of marital status, are addressed "Miss" in English or "Madame" in French, though the two are not interchangeable. As noted in Coslett's statement above citing her personal acceptance of 'Miss', generally teachers or other public officials may specify to which form they prefer, while in other cases social and cultural norms dictate the appropriate form.

===Military and police===
If not specifically using their rank or title, 'sir' is used in the [[United States Armed Forces]] to address a male, senior commissioned officer or civilian.  Privates and [[non-commissioned officer]]s, such as corporals and sergeants, are addressed using their ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=NCO Guide|page=328|edition=9th|last=Rush|first=Robert S.|publisher=Stackpole Book|location=PA, USA|isbn=9780811736145}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, in both the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) and [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), 'sir' is used to address all male commissioned officers.  Male non-commissioned officers and airmen are addressed by their rank.  In the RAF, male [[warrant officers]] are addressed as ''Mr'' by commissioned officers, but as 'sir' by non-commissioned officers and airmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/links/faqs.cfm|publisher=RAF|title=Frequently Asked Questions|date=n.d.|accessdate=4 February 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502065436/http://www.raf.mod.uk/links/faqs.cfm|archivedate=2 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP), only [[commissioned officers]] are addressed as 'sir'; NCOs and [[constables]] are addressed by their rank.  Male [[British police]] officers of the rank of [[Inspector]] or above are addressed as 'Sir' (women of inspecting rank are called Ma'am).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In the [[British Army]], a [[Regimental Sergeant Major]] (RSM), the most senior non-commissioned officer, is addressed as 'Sir' by his subordinates.

In the [[Hong Kong Police Force]], male superiors are respectfully known by their surname followed by 'sir'. For example, Inspector Wong would be addressed or referred to as 'Wong-sir'. Male police officers are sometimes known colloquially as "Ah-sir" (阿Sir) to the wider public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Urbanizing China|date=1992|page=171|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|first=Gregory Eliyu|last=Guldin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service industry===
The term 'Sir' is also used frequently in the customer service industry, by employees to refer to customers, and sometimes vice versa. In the United States, it is much more common in certain areas (even when addressing male peers or men considerably younger). For example, a 1980 study showed that 80 % of service interactions in the South were accompanied by 'Sir' or ''Ma'am'', in comparison to the Northern United States, where 'Sir' was only used 25 % of the time.&lt;ref name="Teachers"/&gt;
