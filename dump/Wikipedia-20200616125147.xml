'''Adam Richard Sandler''' (born September 9, 1966) is an American actor, comedian, screenwriter, film producer, and singer-songwriter. After becoming a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' cast member, he went on to star in many Hollywood feature films, which have combined grossed over $2 billion at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=People Index |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/?view=Actor&amp;sort=sumgross&amp;p=.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326160457/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/?view=Actor&amp;sort=sumgross&amp;p=.htm |archive-date=26 March 2018 |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=28 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Adam Sandler |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/person/126870401-Adam-Sandler#tab=summary |publisher=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]] |access-date=28 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandler is best known for his comedic roles including ''[[Billy Madison]]'' (1995), ''[[Happy Gilmore]]'' (1996), ''[[The Waterboy]]'' (1998), ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'' (1998), ''[[Big Daddy (1999 film)|Big Daddy]]'' (1999), ''[[Mr. Deeds]]'' (2002), ''[[50 First Dates]]'' (2004), ''[[The Longest Yard (2005 film)|The Longest Yard]]'' (2005), ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]'' (2006), ''[[Grown Ups (film)|Grown Ups]]'' (2010), ''[[Just Go with It]]'' (2011), ''[[Grown Ups 2]]'' (2013), ''[[Blended (film)|Blended]]'' (2014) and ''[[Murder Mystery (film)|Murder Mystery]]'' (2019). He also voices [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] in the [[Hotel Transylvania (franchise)|''Hotel Transylvania'' franchise]] (2012–present).

Some of his films, such as the widely panned ''[[Jack and Jill (2011 film)|Jack and Jill]]'', have been heavily criticized, culminating in a shared second place in the number of [[Golden Raspberry Awards]] (three) and Raspberry Award nominations (11), in both cases second only to [[Sylvester Stallone]].

Though he is associated predominantly with broad comedies, Sandler has consistently earned critical praise for his occasional dramatic performances in films such as ''[[Punch-Drunk Love]]'' (2002), ''[[Spanglish (film)|Spanglish]]'' (2004), ''[[Reign Over Me]]'' (2007), ''[[Funny People]]'' (2009), ''[[The Meyerowitz Stories|The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)]]'' (2017), and ''[[Uncut Gems]]'' (2019).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cea|first=Max|url=https://www.salon.com/2017/10/12/noah-baumbach-performs-a-miracle-adam-sandler-doesnt-suck-in-the-meyerowitz-stories/|title=Noah Baumbach performs a miracle: Adam Sandler doesn't suck in 'The Meyerowitz Stories' |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=October 12, 2017|accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adamsandler(cannesPhotocall).jpg|thumb|Sandler at 2002 [[Cannes Film Festival]]]]
Early in his career, in 1987, Sandler played [[Theo Huxtable]]'s friend, Smitty, in ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' and the Stud Boy or Trivia Delinquent in the [[Game show|MTV game show]] ''[[Remote Control (game show)|Remote Control]]''. After his film debut ''[[Going Overboard]]'' in 1989, Sandler performed in comedy clubs, having first taken the stage at his brother's urging when he was 17. He was discovered by comedian [[Dennis Miller]], who caught Sandler's act in Los Angeles and recommended him to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' producer [[Lorne Michaels]]. Sandler was hired as a writer for ''SNL'' in 1990 and became a featured player the following year, making a name for himself by performing amusing original songs on the show, including "[[The Thanksgiving Song]]" and "[[The Chanukah Song]]".&lt;ref name=biography.com/&gt; Sandler told [[Conan O'Brien]] on ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|The Tonight Show]]'' that [[NBC]] fired him and [[Chris Farley]] from the show in 1995, and played this up in his return to the show as a host in 2019.&lt;ref name="Sandler fired"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/2010/01/21/2010-01-21_youre_not_alone_conan_obrien_adam_sandler_says_nbc_fired_him_and_chris_farley_fr.html | title= You're not alone, Conan O'Brien: Adam Sandler says NBC fired him and Chris Farley from 'SNL'| first= Joe |last=Dziemianowicz| work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | location=New York City |date= January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Adam Sandler's "I Was Fired" Monologue - SNL |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eghK5yMpNuc |publisher=SNL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Adam Sandler appeared in the film ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'' with Chris Farley, [[David Spade]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Phil Hartman]], and [[Jane Curtin]]. In 1994, he co-starred in ''[[Airheads]]'' with [[Brendan Fraser]] and [[Steve Buscemi]]. He starred in ''[[Billy Madison]]'' (1995) playing a grown man repeating grades 1–12 to earn back his father's respect and the right to inherit his father's multimillion-dollar hotel empire. The film was successful at the box office despite negative reviews. He followed this film with ''[[Bulletproof (1996 film)|Bulletproof]]'' (1996), and the financially successful comedies ''Happy Gilmore'' (1996) and ''The Wedding Singer'' (1998). He was initially cast in the bachelor party–themed comedy/thriller ''[[Very Bad Things]]'' (1998) but had to back out due to his involvement in ''[[The Waterboy]]'' (1998), one of his first hits.

Although his earliest films did not receive favorable critical attention, he started to receive more positive reviews, beginning with ''Punch-Drunk Love'' in 2002. [[Roger Ebert]]'s review of ''Punch-Drunk Love'' concluded that Sandler had been wasted in earlier films with poorly written scripts and characters with no development.&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, Roger. [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021018/REVIEWS/210180308/1023 "Punch-Drunk Love."] ''Chicago Sun-Times''. October 18, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Sandler has moved outside the genre of slapstick comedy to take on more serious roles, such as the aforementioned ''[[Punch-Drunk Love]]'', for which he was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]], and [[Mike Binder]]'s ''[[Reign Over Me]]'' (2007), a drama about a man who loses his entire family during the [[September 11 attacks]], and then struggles to rekindle a friendship with his old college roommate ([[Don Cheadle]]).

He starred alongside friend [[Kevin James]] in the film ''[[I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry]]'' (2007), and headlined ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]'' (2008). The latter film was written by Sandler, [[Judd Apatow]], and [[Robert Smigel]], and directed by [[Dennis Dugan]].

Sandler's recent comedy films, including ''Grown Ups'' and ''Grown Ups 2'', have received strongly negative reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/grown-ups-2-best-lines-584676|title='Grown Ups 2': The Best Lines from the Worst Reviews|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=July 12, 2013|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing the latter, critic Mark Olsen of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' remarked that Sandler had become the antithesis of [[Judd Apatow]]; he was instead "the white [[Tyler Perry]]: smart enough to know better, savvy enough to do it anyway, lazy enough not to care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-grown-ups-2-review-20130712-story.html|title='Review: 'Grown Ups 2' refuses to leave the sandbox|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=July 11, 2013|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Sandler released his last theatrical film ''[[Pixels (2015 film)|Pixels]]'', based on French director Patrick Jean's [[Pixels (2010 film)|2010 short film of the same name]], before transitioning into a distribution deal with [[Netflix]]. His first original film for Netflix was the Western comedy film ''[[The Ridiculous 6]]''. Despite being universally panned by critics,&lt;ref name="rotten"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_ridiculous_six/ |title= The Ridiculous Six (2015) |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on January 6, 2016, it was announced by Netflix that the film had been viewed more times in 30 days than any other movie in Netflix history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2016/film/news/adam-sandlers-ridiculous-six-is-making-history-for-netflix-1201673572 Adam Sandle'’s 'Ridiculous Six' Is Making History for Netflix] ''Variety.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; He released three additional films on Netflix between 2016 and 2018: ''[[The Do-Over]]'', ''[[Sandy Wexler]]'' and ''[[The Week Of]]''.
