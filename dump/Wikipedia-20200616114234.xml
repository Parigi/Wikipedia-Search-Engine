The '''Microsoft campus''' is the informal name of [[Microsoft]]'s corporate headquarters, located in [[Redmond, Washington]], a suburb of [[Seattle]]. Microsoft initially moved onto the grounds of the campus on February 26, 1986, weeks after, the company went public on March 13. The headquarters has experienced multiple expansions since its establishment.

It is estimated to encompass over {{convert|8|e6sqft|sqm}} of office space and 30,000â€“40,000 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facts About Microsoft |url=http://news.microsoft.com/facts-about-microsoft/ |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional offices on the [[Eastside (King County, Washington)|Eastside]] area of the [[Seattle metropolitan area]] are located in [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]] and [[Issaquah, Washington|Issaquah]]. Building 92 on the campus contains a visitor center (with interactive exhibits) and store that are open to the public.

==History==

Microsoft chose to move its headquarters from [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]] to nearby [[Redmond, Washington|Redmond]] in January 1985, selecting a {{convert|29|acre|adj=mid}} plot of land that would be developed by [[Wright Runstad &amp; Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=January 15, 1985 |title=Microsoft Corp. to move its headquarters to Redmond |page=B2 |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began on August 9, and Microsoft moved into the $25 million facility on February 26, 1986, several weeks before the company's [[initial public offering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Buck |first=Richard |date=March 9, 1986 |title=Computer Memory Explored Conference reveals just how many are interested in the technology |page=D6 |newspaper=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Summerford |first=Tina |date=April 16, 2009 |title=The History of Microsoft - 1985 |url=https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/History/The-History-of-Microsoft-1985 |work=[[Channel 9 (Microsoft)|Channel 9]] |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=July 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move generated some concerns about increased [[traffic congestion]] on the unfinished [[Washington State Route 520|State Route 520]] freeway between Bellevue and Redmond;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Casey |first=Carolyn |date=November 28, 1984 |title=Firm appears headed for site in Redmond |page=F1 |newspaper=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new freeway interchange at Northeast 40th Street would later be built in 2000 to service the campus, after lobbying and partial funding from Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=October 5, 2000 |title=Hwy. 520 ramps expected to ease Redmond commute |page=B1 |work=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ervin |first=Keith |date=March 7, 1996 |title=And now...the Microsoft Inerchange: Company uses clout to determine 520 exit |page=B1 |work=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial campus was on a {{convert|30|acre|adj=on}} lot with six buildings, and was able to accommodate 800 employees but eventually grew to 1,400 by 1988.&lt;ref name="Times-1988"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lalonde |first=James E. |date=January 28, 1988 |title=Microsoft deals with pressure: Heavy demand, not enough room |page=E2 |work=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was once home to chicken farms in the 1920s that were later demolished.&lt;ref name="Times-2017"/&gt; The campus was originally leased to Microsoft from the [[Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association]], a [[pension fund]] manager, until it was bought back in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Scott |date=January 8, 1992 |title=4 original headquarters buildings and land repurchased by Microsoft |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19920108&amp;slug=1469226 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original buildings were given sequential numbers, with the exception of 7 due to a delay in permitting that was instead delayed indefinitely.&lt;ref name="Times-2017"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lerman |first=Rachel |date=November 30, 2017 |title=Microsoft's campus redevelopment: What's staying, what's being torn down |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsofts-campus-redevelopment-whats-staying-whats-being-torn-down/ |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=November 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pond between the original buildings was nicknamed "Lake Bill" for [[Bill Gates]] and was used for post-project celebrations, namely managers being thrown in after a successful launch.&lt;ref name="Times-2017"/&gt;

The first major expansion of the campus came in 1992, bringing the total amount of office space to {{convert|1.7|e6sqft|sqm}} on {{convert|260|acre}} of land. Microsoft also announced its intention to contain most of its future growth within Redmond, while retaining some offices in [[Downtown Bellevue]] and [[Factoria, Bellevue, Washington|Factoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=December 2, 1992 |title=Microsoft will not expand beyond Redmond campus |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19921202&amp;slug=1527777 |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Redmond campus was plagued by hundreds of [[rabbit]]s who spread around the area in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=April 3, 1999 |title=Bunny roundup completed |url=https://products.kitsapsun.com/archive/1999/04-03/0018_redmond__bunny_roundup_completed.html |work=[[Kitsap Sun]] |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=March 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, Microsoft announced the purchase of [[Safeco Corporation|Safeco's]] Redmond campus after the company had begun consolidating its offices at the [[Safeco Tower]] in Seattle's [[University District, Seattle|University District]] a year earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/256201_msftexpands19.html|date=January 19, 2006|title=Microsoft makes a deal for Safeco's Redmond campus|last=Bishop |first=Todd |newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|accessdate=January 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2006, Microsoft announced that it intended to expand its Redmond campus by {{convert|1100000|sqft|m2}} at a cost of $1&amp;nbsp;billion and said that this would create space for between 7,000 and 15,000 new employees over the following three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=webmmsftbuild09&amp;date=20060209 |date=February 9, 2006|title=Microsoft speeding up plans for huge campus redevelopment |last=Dudley |first=Brier|accessdate=January 15, 2008|newspaper=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campus expansion also included more prominent branding and additional recreation areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Romano |first=Benjamin |date=November 11, 2007 |title=Microsoft campus expands, transforms, inside and out |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoft/2004007121_microsoft11.html |work=The Seattle Times |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112055842/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoft/2004007121_microsoft11.html |archivedate=November 12, 2007 |accessdate=May 7, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a [[shopping mall]] called "The Commons" was completed on the campus, bringing {{convert|1.4|e6sqft|sqm}} of retail space, as well as restaurants, a [[soccer field]] and [[pub]] to the West Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chan |first=Sharon Pian |date=April 20, 2009 |title=Microsoft workers get their very own mall, The Commons, on corporate campus |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-workers-get-their-very-own-mall-the-commons-on-corporate-campus/ |newspaper=The Seattle Times |accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latest expansion===

''[[The Seattle Times]]'' reported in early September 2015 that Microsoft had hired [[architecture firm]] [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] to begin a multibillion-dollar redesign of the Redmond campus, using an additional {{convert|1.4|e6sqft|m2}} allowed by an agreement with the City of Redmond.&lt;ref name="Times-20150908"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Yu |first1=Hui-yong |last2=Bass |first2=Dina |date=September 4, 2015 |title=Microsoft considers multibillion-dollar overhaul to Redmond campus |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-is-said-to-weigh-multibillion-campus-revamp/ |newspaper=The Seattle Times |accessdate=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City of Redmond had also approved a rezone in February 2015 to raise the [[height limit]] for buildings on the campus from 6 stories to 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Day |first=Matt |date=December 28, 2015 |title=Microsoftâ€™s next Redmond expansion expected to go vertical |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsofts-next-redmond-expansion-expected-to-go-vertical/ |newspaper=The Seattle Times |accessdate=December 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Microsoft announced plans to demolish 12 buildings on the older East Campus and replace them with 18 new buildings, adding {{convert|2.5|e6sqft}} to house 8,000 additional employees. The newer buildings would be arranged like an urban neighborhood, centered around a {{convert|2|acre|ha|adj=mid}} open space with sports fields (including a [[cricket pitch]]), retail space, and hiking trails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Soper |first=Taylor |date=December 8, 2017 |title=Microsoft plans world-class cricket pitch at Redmond HQ, in first for major U.S. tech campus |url=https://www.geekwire.com/2017/heres-microsoft-building-cricket-field-middle-redeveloped-campus/ |work=GeekWire |accessdate=August 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program, scheduled to be completed by 2023, will raise the total number of buildings on the campus to 131.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jenkins |first=Aric |date=November 29, 2017 |title=Microsoft Will Demolish Its Campus to Build a Mini-City |url=http://fortune.com/2017/11/29/microsoft-redmond-campus-expansion/ |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wingfield |first=Nick |date=November 29, 2017 |title=Microsoft to Expand Campus, as Amazon Looks Elsewhere |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/realestate/commercial/microsoft-headquarters-redmond-washington.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bass |first=Dina |date=November 28, 2017 |title=Microsoft Plans Multibillion-Dollar Campus Overhaul, Adding Open Spaces |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-29/microsoft-plans-multibillion-dollar-campus-overhaul-adding-open-spaces |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A digital recreation of the future campus was made available in [[Minecraft Education Edition]] in November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Novet |first=Jordan |date=November 6, 2018 |title=Microsoft employees can use Minecraft to see how the company's upgraded campus will look |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/06/microsoft-has-a-version-of-its-new-campus-in-minecraft.html |publisher=[[CNBC]] |accessdate=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demolition of the original buildings, including several X-shaped offices built in the 1980s, began in January 2019 and was completed in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lerman |first=Rachel |date=November 10, 2018 |title=Microsoft alumni play one last game of hallway putt-putt before demolition |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-alumni-play-one-last-game-of-hallway-putt-putt-before-demolition/ |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=November 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Novet |first=Jordan |date=January 8, 2019 |title=Microsoft begins demolishing buildings in Redmond campus remodel |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/08/microsoft-demolition-redmond-campus-remodel.html |publisher=CNBC |accessdate=January 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expanded campus will have 17 office buildings and four floors of underground parking with capacity for 6,500 vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Merten |first=Paxtyn |date=October 1, 2019 |title=Microsoft HQ adds underground parking, self-driving car drop-offs and transit-connected pedestrian bridge |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2019/10/01/microsoft-hq-adds-underground-parking-self-driving.html |work=Puget Sound Business Journal |url-access=subscription |accessdate=October 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The Microsoft campus in Redmond sits on {{convert|502|acre|ha}} and has 83 buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=November 2018 |title=Microsoft Redmond Campus Fact Sheet |url=https://news.microsoft.com/uploads/prod/sites/370/2018/11/Microsoft-Redmond-Campus-Fact-Sheet-.pdf |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=December 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Microsoft Redmond Main Campus Map &amp; Buildings |url=https://campusbuilding.com/c/microsoft-redmond-main-campus/ |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=December 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has a total of 125 buildings in the [[Puget Sound region]] and employs 53,576 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=September 30, 2019 |title=Facts About Microsoft |url=https://news.microsoft.com/facts-about-microsoft/ |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=December 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==

The campus is located on both sides of the [[Washington State Route 520|State Route 520]] freeway, which connects it to the cities of [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]] and [[Seattle]] as well as the Redmond [[city center]]. Microsoft paid part of the cost for an [[overpass]] over the freeway at NE 36th Street to relieve congestion on other cross-streets in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 14, 2009 |title=Stimulus money goes for a bridge to Microsoft |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/stimulus-money-goes-for-a-bridge-to-microsoft/ |newspaper=The Seattle Times |accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus is served by buses to Seattle and some [[Eastside (King County, Washington)|Eastside]] cities at the [[Overlake Transit Center]], operated by [[Sound Transit]] and [[King County Metro]]. The [[RapidRide B Line]] also runs through the campus, connecting to downtown Bellevue and Redmond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Overlake Transit Center Boarding Locations |url=http://metro.kingcounty.gov/tops/parknride/boarding/overlake-tc.html |publisher=[[King County Metro]] |accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transit center opened in 2002 and will be the eastern terminus of the [[East Link Extension (Sound Transit)|East Link]] [[light rail]] extension, scheduled to open in 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lindblom |first1=Mike |last2=Brooks |first2=Diane |date=February 2, 2002 |title=Modern transit centers for riders in Everett, Redmond to debut Monday |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20020202&amp;slug=transit02m |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=April 22, 2016 |title=Sound Transit kicks off East Link light rail construction |url=http://www.soundtransit.org/About-Sound-Transit/News-and-events/News-releases/sound-transit-kicks-east-link-light-rail |publisher=[[Sound Transit]] |accessdate=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft partnered with Sound Transit and the City of Redmond to fund a [[pedestrian bridge]] connecting the light rail station to both sides of its campus to open in 2020, providing $33.3 million of the cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ervin |first=Keith |date=November 26, 2013 |title=Microsoft pitches in on bridge over Overlake Transit Center |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/microsoft-pitches-in-on-bridge-over-overlake-transit-center/ |newspaper=The Seattle Times |accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=August 28, 2014 |title=City of Redmond, Sound Transit team up for new pedestrian-bicycle bridge |url=http://www.soundtransit.org/About-Sound-Transit/News-and-events/News-releases/News-release-archive/ST-Redmond-pedestrian-bicycle-bridge-828 |publisher=Sound Transit |accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For employees, Microsoft also operates a [[commuter bus]] service called "The Connector" that provides non-stop service to neighborhoods in Seattle, the Eastside, and [[Snohomish County, Washington|Snohomish County]] from the Redmond campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=September 6, 2007 |title=The Connector Fact Sheet |url=https://news.microsoft.com/2007/09/06/the-connector-fact-sheet/ |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=December 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shuttles, which began operating in 2007, were targeted in early 2014 as a symbol of [[gentrification]] in similar fashion to the [[San Francisco tech bus protests]] that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bishop |first=Todd |date=February 10, 2014 |title=Activists block Microsoft shuttles in Seattle, in anti-gentrification protest |url=http://www.geekwire.com/2014/activists-block-microsoft-shuttles-anti-gentrification-protest/ |work=[[GeekWire]] |accessdate=December 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Grande |first=Alison |date=February 10, 2014 |title=Microsoft Connector shuttles targeted by protestors |url=http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/microsoft-connector-shuttles-targeted-protestors/ndKRK/ |work=[[KIRO-TV]] |accessdate=December 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wingfield |first=Nick |date=February 10, 2014 |title=Seattle Gets Its Own Tech Bus Protest |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/seattle-gets-its-own-tech-bus-protest/ |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=December 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company also runs a [[shuttle bus service]], named the "Shuttle Connect", between buildings on the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fostering Alternative Ways to Commute at Microsoft |publisher=Microsoft |url=http://www.microsoft.com/environment/our_commitment/articles/alternative_commuting.aspx |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501154211/http://www.microsoft.com/environment/our_commitment/articles/alternative_commuting.aspx |archivedate=May 1, 2008 |accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
