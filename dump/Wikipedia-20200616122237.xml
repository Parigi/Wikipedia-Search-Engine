{{History of Iraq}}
'''Mesopotamia''' was the name of two distinct [[Roman province]]s, the one a short-lived creation of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Trajan]] in 116–117 and the other established by Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] in ca. 198, which ranged between the Roman and the [[Sassanid empire]]s, until the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century.

== Trajan's province==
In 113, Emperor [[Trajan]] (r. 98–117) launched a war against Rome's long-time eastern rival, the [[Parthian Empire]]. In 114, he conquered [[Roman Armenia|Armenia]], which was made into a province, and by the end of 115, he had conquered northern [[Mesopotamia]]. This too was organized as a province in early 116, when coins were minted to celebrate the fact.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett (1997), pp. 196, 198–199&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the same year, Trajan marched into central and southern Mesopotamia (enlarging and completing the province of ''Mesopotamia'') and across the river [[Tigris]] to [[Adiabene]], which he annexed into another Roman province, [[Assyria (Roman province)|Assyria]].&lt;ref&gt;Bennett (1997), p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; But he did not stop there. In the last months of 116, he captured the great Persian city of [[Susa]]. He deposed the Parthian king [[Osroes I]] and put his own puppet ruler [[Parthamaspates of Parthia|Parthamaspates]] on the Parthian throne. Never again would the Roman Empire advance so far to the east.

As soon as Trajan died, however, his successor [[Hadrian]] (r. 117–138) relinquished his conquests east of the [[Euphrates]] river, which became again the [[Roman Empire]]'s eastern boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett (1997), pp. 206–207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, Dickson &amp; Purdie (2004), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

== Severus's province ==

===Lucius Verus's campaign===
Northern Mesopotamia, including [[Osroene]], came again under Roman control in the [[Roman–Parthian War of 161–166|expedition]] of [[Lucius Verus]] in 161–166, but were not formally organized into provinces; instead, they were left under local vassal rulers, although Roman garrisons were maintained, notably at [[Nisibis]].

===  Year Of The Five Emperors===
This control was threatened in 195, during the civil war between [[Septimius Severus]] (r. 193–211) and the usurper [[Pescennius Niger]], when rebellions broke out in the area, and Nisibis was besieged. Severus quickly restored order and organized Osroene as a full province.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, Dickson &amp; Purdie (2004), pp. 77–78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Southern (2001), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reconquest by Severus ===
Next Severus embarked on a war against Parthia, which he concluded successfully with the [[Battle of Ctesiphon (198)|sack]] of the Parthian capital [[Ctesiphon]]. In emulation of Trajan, he re-established a province of Mesopotamia in 198, with Nisibis, elevated to the status of a full ''[[colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'', as its capital.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, Dickson &amp; Purdie (2004), pp. 78–79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Southern (2001), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Trajan's province, which encompassed the whole of Roman-occupied Mesopotamia between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, the new province was limited between the province of [[Osroene (Roman province)|Osroene]] to the south, the Euphrates and Tigris to the north, and the river Chaboras (modern [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur]]) to the east.&lt;ref name="ODB"&gt;Kazhdan (1991), p. 1348&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Warzone ===
[[File:1864 Johnson Map of the Roman Empire - Geographicus - RomanEmpire-johnson-1864.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Map showing the Mesopotamia province]]
For the remainder of its existence, the new province would remain a bone of contention between the Romans and their eastern neighbors, suffering heavily in the recurrent [[Roman–Persian Wars]]. In the turmoil that followed the [[Year of the Six Emperors]], in 239–243, [[Ardashir I]] (r. 224–241), the founder of the new [[Sassanid Empire]] which replaced the moribund Parthians, attacked and overran the area, but it was [[Battle of Resaena|recovered]] by [[Gaius Furius Sabinius Aquila Timesitheus|Timesitheus]] before his death in 243.&lt;ref&gt;Southern (2001), p. 70–71&lt;/ref&gt; In the 250s, the Persian shah [[Shapur I]] (r. ca. 240–270) attacked Mesopotamia, and fought with the Roman emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] (r. 253–260), whom he [[Battle of Edessa|captured]] at [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] in 260.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, Dickson &amp; Purdie (2004), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; In the next year, however, Shapur was heavily defeated by [[Odaenathus]] of [[Palmyra]] and driven out of Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;Mommsen, Dickson &amp; Purdie (2004), pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reorganisation ==
Under the reforms of [[Diocletian]] (r. 284–305) and [[Constantine I]] (r. 306–337), it became part of the [[Diocese of the East]], which in turn was subordinated to the [[praetorian prefecture of the East]]. 
[[File:Notitia Dignitatum - Dux Mesopotamiae.jpg|thumbnail|right|Map of Roman military stations in Mesopotamia from a 1436 manuscript]]
[[Nisibis]] and [[Singara]], along with the territory in [[Adiabene]] conquered by Diocletian were lost after the debacle of [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]]'s [[Battle of Ctesiphon (363)|Persian expedition]] in 363, and the capital was transferred to [[Amida (Roman city)|Amida]], while the seat of the military commander, the ''dux Mesopotamiae'', was located at [[Constantina (Osrhoene)|Constantina]]. Other cities included [[Silvan, Diyarbakır|Martyropolis]] and [[Hasankeyf|Kephas]].&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt;

After the troubles Roman forces faced in the [[Anastasian War]] of 502–506, the East Roman emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] (r. 491–518) built the fortress of [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]] as a counter to Nisibis and as the new base of the ''dux Mesopotamiae''.

During the reforms of [[Justinian I]] (r. 527–565), the province was split up: the northern districts with Martyropolis went to the new province of [[Armenia IV]], while the remainder was divided into two civil and ecclesiastical districts, one (the region south of the Tigris) with capital at Amida and the other (the region of [[Tur Abdin]]) with capital at Dara.&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt; The province suffered greatly during the near-constant wars with Persia in the 6th century. In 573, the Persians even took Dara, although the East Romans recovered it under the peace of 591. They lost it again to the Persians in the [[Byzantine-Sassanid War of 602–628|great war of 602–628]], and regained it afterwards only to lose the entire region permanently to the [[Muslim conquests]] in 633–640.&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt;
