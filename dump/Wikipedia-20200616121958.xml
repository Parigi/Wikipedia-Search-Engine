The '''Holy Roman Empire''' ({{lang-la|Sacrum Imperium Romanum}}; {{lang-de|Heiliges Römisches Reich}}), often unofficially referred to as the '''Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B1aHCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Holy+Roman+Empire#v=onepage|title=Heart of Europe: A History of the Holy Roman Empire|first=Peter H.|last=Wilson|date=10 April 2016|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674058095|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] that developed during the [[Early Middle Ages]] and continued until its [[Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire|dissolution in 1806]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269851/Holy-Roman-Empire Holy Roman Empire], Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved 15 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest territory of the [[empire]] after 962 was the [[Kingdom of Germany]], though it also included the neighboring [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]], plus numerous other territories, and soon after the [[Kingdom of Arles|Kingdom of Burgundy]] was added. However, while by the 15th century the Empire was still in theory composed of three major blocks – Italy, Germany, and Burgundy – in practice, the links between these blocks had become so unsubstantial that only the Kingdom of Germany remained, nearly all the Italian territories for instance having become in effect part of a narrowly-defined Habsburg dynastic patrimony, unconnected to the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=O8cQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA183 |page=183 |title=The Holy Roman Empire |last1=(Viscount) |first1=James Bryce Bryce |year=1899 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Whaley&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QXdPzWXCphkC&amp;pg=PA17 |pages=17–21 |title=Germany and the Holy Roman Empire: Volume I: Maximilian I to the Peace of Westphalia, 1493-1648 |isbn=9780198731016 |last1=Whaley |first1=Joachim |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=e_m13Hk3AFEC&amp;pg=PA23 |page=23 |title=Central Europe: Enemies, Neighbors, Friends |isbn=9780198026075 |last1=Johnson |first1=Lonnie |date=31 October 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The external borders of the Empire did not change noticeably from the [[Peace of Westphalia]] – which acknowledged the exclusion of Switzerland and the Northern Netherlands, and the French protectorate over Alsace – to the dissolution of the Empire. By then, it largely contained only German-speaking territories, plus the Kingdom of Bohemia. At the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, most of the Holy Roman Empire was included in the [[German Confederation]].

On 25 December 800, [[Pope Leo III]] crowned the [[Kings of the Franks|Frankish king]] [[Charlemagne]] as [[Carolingian Empire|Emperor]], reviving the title in [[Western Europe]], more than three centuries after the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall]] of the earlier ancient [[Western Roman Empire]] in 476. The title continued in the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian family]] until 888 and from 896 to 899, after which it was contested by the rulers of Italy in a series of civil wars until the death of the last Italian claimant, [[Berengar I of Italy|Berengar I]], in 924. The title was revived again in 962 when [[Otto I]] was crowned emperor, fashioning himself as the successor of Charlemagne&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Norman F. Cantor|title=Civilization of the Middle Ages|year=1993|pages=212–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; and beginning a continuous existence of the empire for over eight centuries.&lt;ref name=Gascoigne&gt;{{cite web|author=Bamber Gascoigne|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/plaintexthistories.asp?historyid=aa35|title=History of the Holy Roman Empire|website=HistoryWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, A History of Europe (Oxford, 1996), pp.&amp;nbsp;316–317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;While Charlemagne and his successors assumed variations of the title ''emperor'', none termed themselves ''Roman emperor'' until Otto II in 983.

The exact term "Holy Roman Empire" was not used until the 13th century, but the concept of ''[[translatio imperii]]'',{{efn|"transfer of rule"}} the notion that he – the sovereign ruler – held supreme power inherited from the ancient emperors of [[Roman Empire|Rome]], was fundamental to the prestige of the emperor.&lt;ref name=Whaley /&gt; The office of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] was traditionally elective, although frequently controlled by dynasties. The mostly German [[prince-electors]], the highest-ranking noblemen of the empire, usually elected one of their peers as "[[King of the Romans]]", and he would later be crowned emperor by the [[Pope]]; the tradition of papal coronations was discontinued in the 16th century.

The empire never achieved the extent of political unification as was formed to the west in [[France]], evolving instead into a decentralized, limited elective monarchy composed of [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|hundreds of sub-units]]: [[king]]doms, [[principality|principalities]], [[duchy|duchies]], [[county|counties]], [[prince-bishop]]rics, [[Free Imperial City|Free Imperial Cities]], and other domains.&lt;ref name=Johnson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/national/hre.htm The Holy Roman Empire], Heraldica.org.&lt;/ref&gt; The power of the emperor was limited, and while the various princes, lords, bishops, and cities of the empire were [[vassal]]s who owed the emperor their allegiance, they also possessed an extent of privileges that gave them ''de facto'' independence within their territories. Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] [[Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire|dissolved]] the empire on 6 August 1806 following the creation of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] by Emperor [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]] the month before.

Before 1157, the realm was merely referred to as the '''Roman Empire'''.&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;Peter Hamish Wilson, ''The Holy Roman Empire, 1495–1806'', MacMillan Press 1999, London, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''sacrum'' ("holy", in the sense of "consecrated") in connection with the medieval Roman Empire was used beginning in 1157 under [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I Barbarossa]] ("Holy Empire"): the term was added to reflect Frederick's ambition to dominate Italy and the [[Papacy]].&lt;ref name="Whaley17"&gt;Whaley 2011, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The form "Holy Roman Empire" is attested from 1254 onward.&lt;ref name="Peter Moraw 1999"&gt;Peter Moraw, ''Heiliges Reich'', in: [[Lexikon des Mittelalters]], Munich &amp; Zürich: Artemis 1977–1999, vol. 4, col. 2025–2028.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a decree following the 1512 [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Diet]] of [[Cologne]], the name was changed to the "Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation" ({{lang-de|Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation}}, {{lang-la|Sacrum Imperium Romanum Nationis Germanicæ}}),&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hamish Wilson, ''The Holy Roman Empire, 1495–1806'', MacMillan Press 1999, London, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; a form first used in a document in 1474.&lt;ref name="Whaley17" /&gt; The new title was adopted partly because the Empire had lost most of its territories in Italy and Burgundy (the [[Kingdom of Arles]]) to the south and west by the late 15th century,&lt;ref&gt;Whaley 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;19–20&lt;/ref&gt; but also to emphasize the new importance of the German [[Imperial Estate]]s in ruling the Empire due to the Imperial Reform.&lt;ref&gt;Hans K. Schulze: ''Grundstrukturen der Verfassung im Mittelalter'', Bd. 3 (''Kaiser und Reich''). [[Kohlhammer Verlag]], Stuttgart [u.&amp;nbsp;a.] 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;52–55.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 18th century, the term "Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation" had fallen out of official use. Contradicting the traditional view concerning that designation, Hermann Weisert has argued in a study on imperial titulature that, despite the claims of many textbooks, the name ''"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation"'' never had an official status and points out that documents were thirty times as likely to omit the national suffix as include it.&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Wilson, "Bolstering the Prestige of the Habsburgs: The End of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806", in ''The International History Review'', Vol. 28, No. 4 (Dec. 2006), p. 719.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a famous assessment of the name, the political philosopher [[Voltaire]] remarked sardonically: "This body which was called and which still calls itself the Holy Roman Empire was in no way holy, nor Roman, nor an empire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Voltaire |title=Essais sur les mœurs et l'ésprit des nations |year=1773 |orig-year=1756 |edition=nouvelle |location=Neuchâtel |volume=3 |chapter=Chapitre lxx |page=338 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/essaissurlesmoeu03volt/page/338 |quote=Ce corps qui s'appelait, &amp; qui s'appelle encore, le Saint-Empire Romain, n'était en aucune manière, ni saint, ni romain, ni empire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern period, the Empire was often informally called the '''German Empire''' ({{lang|de|Deutsches Reich|italics=yes}}) or '''Roman-German Empire''' ({{lang|de|Römisch-Deutsches Reich|italic=yes}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|chapter=Heiliges Römisches Reich – Kapitel 1: Gebiet und Institutionen |author=Marco Jorio|title=Heiliges Römisches Reich|encyclopedia=Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz |chapter-url=https://hls-dhs-dss.ch/de/articles/006626/2016-04-25/}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its dissolution through the end of the [[German Empire]], it was often called "the old Empire" ({{lang|de|das alte Reich|italics=yes}}). Beginning in 1923, early-twentieth century German nationalists and [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] propaganda would identify the Holy Roman Empire as the '''First Reich''' (''Reich'' meaning empire), with the German Empire as the Second Reich and either a future German nationalist state or Nazi Germany as the [[Third Reich]].{{sfn|Lauryssens|1999|p=102}}

As [[Western Roman Empire|Roman]] power in [[Gaul]] declined during the 5th century, local Germanic tribes assumed control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CtUueBIMm-cC&amp;pg=PA167 |pages=167–70 |title=State and Society in the Early Middle Ages: The Middle Rhine Valley, 400–1000 |isbn=9781139425582 |last1=Innes |first1=Matthew |date=24 April 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 5th and early 6th centuries, the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingians]], under [[Clovis I]] and his successors, consolidated [[Franks|Frankish]] tribes and extended hegemony over others to gain control of northern Gaul and the middle [[Rhine river]] valley region.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce (1913), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies (1996), pp. 232, 234.&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the 8th century, however, the Merovingians had been reduced to figureheads, and the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], led by [[Charles Martel]], had become the ''de facto'' rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce (1913), pp. 35–36, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In 751, Martel's son [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]] became King of the Franks, and later gained the sanction of the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Rosamond McKitterick, [https://www.questia.com/read/52238336/the-frankish-kingdoms-under-the-carolingians-751-987 The Frankish Kingdoms under the Carolingians, 751–987] (1983), pp. 48–50. {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB-Pippin&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/France|title=France &amp;#124; History, Map, Flag, Capital, &amp; Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Carolingians would maintain a close alliance with the Papacy.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce (1913), pp. 38–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 768, Pepin's son [[Charlemagne]] became King of the Franks and began an extensive expansion of the realm. He eventually incorporated the territories of present-day France, Germany, northern Italy, the Low Countries and beyond, linking the Frankish kingdom with Papal lands.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (1996), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=OIzreCGlHxIC&amp;pg=PT125 |pages=113–14 |title=Dictionary of Wars |isbn=9781438129167 |last1=Kohn |first1=George C. |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although antagonism about the expense of [[Byzantine Papacy|Byzantine domination]] had long persisted within Italy, a political rupture was set in motion in earnest in 726 by the [[Byzantine iconoclasm|iconoclasm]] of Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]], in what [[Pope Gregory II]] saw as the latest in a series of imperial heresies.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, 1997, pp. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; In 797, the Eastern Roman Emperor [[Constantine VI]] was removed from the throne by his mother [[Irene of Athens|Irene]] who declared herself Empress. As the Latin Church, influenced by Gothic law forbidding female leadership and property ownership,{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} only regarded a male Roman Emperor as the head of Christendom, Pope Leo III sought a new candidate for the dignity, excluding consultation with the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]]. Charlemagne's good service to the Church in his defense of Papal possessions against the [[Lombards]] made him the ideal candidate. On Christmas Day of 800, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne emperor, restoring the title in the West for the first time in over three centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, pp. 44, 50–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKitterick (1983), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen as symbolic of the papacy turning away from the declining [[Byzantine Empire]] towards the new power of [[Carolingian]] [[Francia]]. Charlemagne adopted the formula ''[[Renovatio imperii Romanorum]]'' ("renewal of the Roman Empire"). In 802, Irene was overthrown and exiled by [[Nikephoros I]] and henceforth there were two Roman Emperors.

After Charlemagne died in 814, the imperial crown passed to his son, [[Louis the Pious]]. Upon Louis' death in 840, it passed to his son [[Lothair I|Lothair]], who had been his co-ruler. By this point the territory of Charlemagne had been divided into several territories, and over the course of the later ninth century the title of Emperor was disputed by the Carolingian rulers of [[Western Francia]] and [[Eastern Francia]], with first the western king ([[Charles the Bald]]) and then the eastern ([[Charles the Fat]]), who briefly reunited the Empire, attaining the prize; however, after the death of Charles the Fat in 888 the Carolingian Empire broke apart, and was never restored. According to [[Regino of Prüm]], the parts of the realm "spewed forth kinglets", and each part elected a kinglet "from its own bowels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZtYiBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131 |page=131 |title=The Birth of the West: Rome, Germany, France, and the Creation of Europe in the Tenth Century |isbn=9781610393683 |last1=Collins |first1=Paul |date=4 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Charles the Fat, those crowned emperor by the [[pope]] controlled only territories in Italy. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The last such emperor was [[Berengar I of Italy]], who died in 924.

==== Formation of the Ottonian Empire ====
Around 900, autonomous [[stem duchy|stem duchies]] ([[Duchy of Franconia|Franconia]], [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabia]], [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]], and [[Lotharingia#Duchy of Lotharingia|Lotharingia]]) reemerged in East Francia. After the Carolingian king [[Louis the Child]] died without issue in 911, East Francia did not turn to the Carolingian ruler of West Francia to take over the realm but instead elected one of the dukes, [[Conrad of Franconia]], as ''Rex Francorum Orientalium''.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite book |title=A history of Germany from the earliest times to the present day |last=Taylor |first=Bayard |last2=Hansen-Taylor |first2=Marie  |year=1894 |page=117 |publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Co. |place=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|117}} On his deathbed, Conrad yielded the crown to his main rival, [[Henry the Fowler]] of Saxony (r. 919–36), who was elected king at the Diet of [[Fritzlar]] in 919.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;{{rp|118}} Henry reached a truce with the raiding [[Magyars]], and in 933 he won a first victory against them in the [[Battle of Riade]].&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;{{rp|121}}

Henry died in 936, but his descendants, the [[Ottonian dynasty|Liudolfing (or Ottonian) dynasty]], would continue to rule the Eastern kingdom for roughly a century. Upon Henry the Fowler's death, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto]], his son and designated successor,&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Hoyt and Stanley Chodorow, ''Europe in the Middle Ages'' (Harcourt brace Jovanovich, Inc., 1976) p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; was elected King in [[Aachen]] in 936.&lt;ref name="magill"&gt;{{cite book|last=Magill|first=Frank|title=Dictionary of World Biography|volume=II|year=1998|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|706}} He overcame a series of revolts from a younger brother and from several dukes. After that, the king managed to control the appointment of dukes and often also employed bishops in administrative affairs.&lt;ref name="cantor"&gt;{{cite book |first=Norman F. |last=Cantor |authorlink=Norman Cantor |year=1994 |title=The Civilization of the Middle Ages|publisher=Harper Perennial|isbn=978-0-06-092553-6|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|212–13}}

[[File:HRR.gif|thumb|left|upright=1.1|The Holy Roman Empire from 962 to 1806]]

In 951, Otto came to the aid of [[Adelaide of Italy|Adelaide]], the widowed queen of Italy, defeating her enemies, marrying her, and taking control over Italy.&lt;ref name="cantor" /&gt;{{rp|214–15}} In 955, Otto won a decisive victory over the [[Magyars]] in the [[Battle of Lechfeld]].&lt;ref name="magill" /&gt;{{rp|707}} In 962, Otto was crowned emperor by [[Pope John XII]],&lt;ref name="magill" /&gt;{{rp|707}} thus intertwining the affairs of the German kingdom with those of Italy and the Papacy. Otto's coronation as Emperor marked the German kings as successors to the Empire of Charlemagne, which through the concept of ''[[translatio imperii]]'', also made them consider themselves as successors to Ancient Rome.

The kingdom had no permanent capital city.&lt;ref name=bro&gt;{{cite book
|title=Nuremberg: The imaginary capital |first=Stephen |last=Brockmann |authorlink= |editor2-last= |editor2-first= |edition= |volume= |year=2006 |origyear= |page=15 |publisher=Camden House |place=Rochester, NY |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QnBVEg8t4TcC&amp;pg=PA15 |accessdate= |isbn=978-1-57113-345-8 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kings traveled between residences (called [[Kaiserpfalz]]) to discharge affairs, though each king preferred certain places; in Otto's case, this was the city of [[Magdeburg]]. Kingship continued to be transferred by election, but Kings often ensured their own sons were elected during their lifetimes, enabling them to keep the crown for their families. This only changed after the end of the Salian dynasty in the 12th century.

[[File:Heiliges Römisches Reich 1000.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The Holy Roman Empire during the [[Ottonian Dynasty]]]]
[[File:Holy Roman Empire 11th century map-en.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|The Holy Roman Empire between 972 and 1032]]

In 963, Otto deposed the current Pope John XII and chose [[Pope Leo VIII]] as the new pope (although John XII and Leo VIII both claimed the papacy until 964 when John XII died). This also renewed the conflict with the [[Byzantine Emperor|Eastern Emperor in Constantinople]], especially after Otto's son [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] (r. 967–83) adopted the designation ''imperator Romanorum''. Still, Otto II formed marital ties with the east when he married the Byzantine princess [[Theophanu]].&lt;ref name="magill" /&gt;{{rp|708}} Their son, [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]], came to the throne only three years old, and was subjected to a power struggle and series of regencies until his age of majority in 994. Up to that time, he had remained in Germany, while a deposed duke, [[Crescentius II]], ruled over Rome and part of Italy, ostensibly in his stead.

In 996 Otto III appointed his cousin [[Pope Gregory V|Gregory V]] the first German Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. McBrien, ''Lives of the Popes: The Pontiffs from St. Peter to Benedict XVI'', (HarperCollins Publishers, 2000), 138.&lt;/ref&gt; A foreign pope and foreign papal officers were seen with suspicion by Roman nobles, who were led by [[Crescentius II]] to revolt. [[Otto III]]'s former mentor [[Antipope John XVI]] briefly held Rome, until the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] seized the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/How%20to%20See%20the%20Vatican|title=How to See the Vatican|last=Sladen|first=Douglas Brooke Wheelton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto died young in 1002, and was succeeded by his cousin [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]], who focused on Germany.&lt;ref name="cantor" /&gt;{{rp|215–17}}

[[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] died in 1024 and [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]], first of the [[Salian|Salian Dynasty]], was elected king only after some debate among dukes and nobles. This group eventually developed into the college of [[prince-elector|Electors]].

The Holy Roman Empire became eventually composed of four kingdoms. The kingdoms were:
* [[Kingdom of Germany]] (part of the empire since 962),
* [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] (from 962 until 1648),
* [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] (since 1002 as the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] and raised to a kingdom in 1198),
* [[Kingdom of Arles|Kingdom of Burgundy]] (from 1032 to 1378).

=== High Middle Ages ===

==== Investiture controversy ====
Kings often employed bishops in administrative affairs and often determined who would be appointed to ecclesiastical offices.&lt;ref name="Barraclough"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barraclough|first=Geoffrey|title=The Origins of Modern Germany|year=1984|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Co. Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-30153-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|101–134}} In the wake of the [[Cluniac Reforms]], this involvement was increasingly seen as inappropriate by the Papacy. The reform-minded [[Pope Gregory VII]] was determined to oppose such practices, which led to the [[Investiture Controversy]] with [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] (r. 1056–1106), the King of the Romans and Holy Roman Emperor.&lt;ref name="Barraclough" /&gt;{{rp|101–34}} Henry IV repudiated the Pope's interference and persuaded his bishops to excommunicate the Pope, whom he famously addressed by his born name "Hildebrand", rather than his regnal name "Pope Gregory VII".&lt;ref name="Barraclough" /&gt;{{rp|109}} The Pope, in turn, excommunicated the king, declared him deposed, and dissolved the oaths of loyalty made to Henry.&lt;ref name=Gascoigne /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barraclough" /&gt;{{rp|109}} The king found himself with almost no political support and was forced to make the famous [[Walk to Canossa]] in 1077,&lt;ref name="Barraclough" /&gt;{{rp|122–24}} by which he achieved a lifting of the excommunication at the price of humiliation. Meanwhile, the German princes had elected another king, [[Rudolf of Swabia]].&lt;ref name="Barraclough" /&gt;{{rp|123}} Henry managed to defeat him but was subsequently confronted with more uprisings, renewed excommunication, and even the rebellion of his sons. After his death, his second son, [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]], reached an agreement with the Pope and the bishops in the 1122 [[Concordat of Worms]].&lt;ref name="Barraclough" /&gt;{{rp|123–34}} The political power of the Empire was maintained, but the conflict had demonstrated the limits of the ruler's power, especially in regard to the Church, and it robbed the king of the sacral status he had previously enjoyed. The Pope and the German princes had surfaced as major players in the political system of the empire.

=== Holy Roman Empire under Hohenstaufen dynasty ===
[[File:Mitteleuropa zur Zeit der Staufer.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Hohenstaufen-ruled Holy Roman Empire and [[Kingdom of Sicily]]. Imperial and directly held Hohenstaufen lands in the Empire are shown in bright yellow.]]
When the Salian dynasty ended with Henry V's death in 1125, the princes chose not to elect the next of kin, but rather [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair]], the moderately powerful but already old Duke of Saxony. When he died in 1137, the princes again aimed to check royal power; accordingly they did not elect Lothair's favoured heir, his son-in-law [[Henry X, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Proud]] of the [[House of Welf|Welf]] family, but [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] of the [[Hohenstaufen]] family, the grandson of Emperor Henry IV and thus a nephew of Emperor Henry V. This led to over a century of strife between the two houses. Conrad ousted the Welfs from their possessions, but after his death in 1152, his nephew [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I "Barbarossa"]] succeeded him and made peace with the Welfs, restoring his cousin [[Henry the Lion]] to his – albeit diminished – possessions.

The Hohenstaufen rulers increasingly lent land to ''ministerialia'', formerly non-free servicemen, who Frederick hoped would be more reliable than dukes. Initially used mainly for war services, this new class of people would form the basis for the later [[Imperial Knight|knights]], another basis of imperial power. A further important constitutional move at Roncaglia was the establishment of a new peace mechanism for the entire empire, the [[Landfrieden]], with the first imperial one being issued in 1103 under [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] at [[Mainz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YvEIPYhxqi4C&amp;pg=PA156 |page=156 |title=Vengeance in Medieval Europe: A Reader |isbn=9781442601260 |last1=Smail |first1=Daniel Lord |last2=Gibson |first2=Kelly |date=January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cUl53tLtFukC&amp;pg=PA398 |page=398 |title=The New Cambridge Medieval History |isbn=9780521414111 |last1=McKitterick |first1=Rosamond |last2=Fouracre |first2=Paul |last3=Reuter |first3=Timothy |last4=Luscombe |first4=David Edward |last5=Abulafia |first5=David |last6=Riley-Smith |first6=Jonathan |last7=Allmand |first7=C. T. |last8=Jones |first8=Michael |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an attempt to abolish private feuds, between the many dukes and other people, and to tie the Emperor's subordinates to a legal system of jurisdiction and public prosecution of criminal acts – a predecessor of the modern concept of "[[rule of law]]". Another new concept of the time was the systematic foundation of new cities by the Emperor and by the local dukes. These were partly caused by the explosion in population, and they also concentrated economic power at strategic locations. Before this, cities had only existed in the form of old Roman foundations or older bishoprics. Cities that were founded in the 12th century include [[Freiburg]], possibly the economic model for many later cities, and [[Munich]].

[[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], also called Frederick Barbarossa, was crowned Emperor in 1155. He emphasized the "Romanness" of the empire, partly in an attempt to justify the power of the Emperor independent of the (now strengthened) Pope. An imperial assembly at the fields of Roncaglia in 1158 reclaimed imperial rights in reference to [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'s [[Corpus Juris Civilis]]. Imperial rights had been referred to as ''regalia'' since the Investiture Controversy but were enumerated for the first time at Roncaglia. This comprehensive list included public roads, tariffs, coining, collecting punitive fees, and the investiture or seating and unseating of office holders. These rights were now explicitly rooted in Roman Law, a far-reaching constitutional act.

Frederick's policies were primarily directed at Italy, where he clashed with the increasingly wealthy and free-minded cities of the north, especially [[Milan]]. He also embroiled himself in another conflict with the Papacy by supporting a candidate elected by a minority against [[Pope Alexander III]] (1159–81). Frederick supported a succession of [[antipope]]s before finally making peace with Alexander in 1177. In Germany, the Emperor had repeatedly protected Henry the Lion against complaints by rival princes or cities (especially in the cases of [[Munich]] and [[Lübeck]]). Henry gave only lackluster support to Frederick's policies, and in a critical situation during the Italian wars, Henry refused the Emperor's plea for military support. After returning to Germany, an embittered Frederick opened proceedings against the Duke, resulting in a public ban and the confiscation of all his territories. In 1190, Frederick participated in the [[Third Crusade]] and died in the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1m4fbJyQ4pkC&amp;pg=PA129 |page=129 |title=The Crusades and the Military Orders: Expanding the Frontiers of Medieval Latin Christianity |isbn=9789639241428 |last1=Hunyadi |first1=Zsolt |last2=Laszlovszky |first2=J¢Zsef |date=January 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Hohenstaufen period, German princes facilitated a successful, peaceful [[Ostsiedlung|eastward settlement]] of lands that were uninhabited or inhabited sparsely by [[West Slavs]]. [[Germans|German speaking]] farmers, traders, and craftsmen from the western part of the Empire, both Christians and Jews, moved into these areas. The gradual [[Germanization]] of these lands was a complex phenomenon that should not be interpreted in the biased terms of 19th-century [[nationalism]]. The eastward settlement expanded the influence of the empire to include [[Pomerania]] and [[Silesia]], as did the intermarriage of the local, still mostly Slavic, rulers with German spouses. The [[Teutonic Knights]] were invited to [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] by Duke [[Konrad of Masovia]] to Christianize the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]] in 1226. The [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights|monastic state of the Teutonic Order]] ({{lang-de|Deutschordensstaat}}) and its later German successor state of [[Prussia]] were never part of the Holy Roman Empire.

Under the son and successor of Frederick Barbarossa, [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], the Hohenstaufen dynasty reached its apex. Henry added the Norman kingdom of Sicily to his domains, held English king [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] captive, and aimed to establish a hereditary monarchy when he died in 1197. As his son, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], though already elected king, was still a small child and living in Sicily, German princes chose to elect an adult king, resulting in the dual election of Frederick Barbarossa's youngest son [[Philip of Swabia]] and Henry the Lion's son [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Brunswick]], who competed for the crown. Otto prevailed for a while after Philip was murdered in a private squabble in 1208 until he began to also claim Sicily.

[[File:War flag of the Holy Roman Empire (1200-1350).svg|thumb|left|The ''[[Reichssturmfahne]]'', a military [[banner]] during the 13th and early 14th centuries]]

[[Pope Innocent III]], who feared the threat posed by a union of the empire and Sicily, was now supported by Frederick II, who marched to Germany and defeated Otto. After his victory, Frederick did not act upon his promise to keep the two realms separate. Though he had made his son Henry king of Sicily before marching on Germany, he still reserved real political power for himself. This continued after Frederick was crowned Emperor in 1220. Fearing Frederick's concentration of power, the Pope finally excommunicated the Emperor. Another point of contention was the crusade, which Frederick had promised but repeatedly postponed. Now, although excommunicated, Frederick led the [[Sixth Crusade]] in 1228, which ended in negotiations and a temporary restoration of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

Despite his imperial claims, Frederick's rule was a major turning point towards the disintegration of central rule in the Empire. While concentrated on establishing a modern, centralized state in Sicily, he was mostly absent from Germany and issued far-reaching privileges to Germany's secular and ecclesiastical princes: in the 1220 ''[[Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis]],'' Frederick gave up a number of ''regalia'' in favour of the bishops, among them tariffs, coining, and fortification. The 1232 ''[[Statutum in favorem principum]]'' mostly extended these privileges to secular territories. Although many of these privileges had existed earlier, they were now granted globally, and once and for all, to allow the German princes to maintain order north of the Alps while Frederick concentrated on Italy. The 1232 document marked the first time that the German dukes were called ''domini terræ,'' owners of their lands, a remarkable change in terminology as well.

==== Kingdom of Bohemia ====
[[File:Karte Böhmische Krone.png|thumb|[[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] since the reign of Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]]]
The [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] was a significant regional power during the [[Middle Ages]]. In 1212, King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Ottokar I]] (bearing the title "king" since 1198) extracted a [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] (a formal edict) from the emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], confirming the royal title for Ottokar and his descendants and the Duchy of Bohemia was raised to a kingdom. Bohemian kings would be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] set [[Prague]] to be the seat of the Holy Roman Emperor.

==== Interregnum ====
{{main|Interregnum (Holy Roman Empire)}}
After the death of Frederick II in 1250, the German kingdom was divided between his son [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad IV]] (died 1254) and the [[Anti-king#Germany|anti-king]], [[Count William II of Holland|William of Holland]] (died 1256). Conrad's death was followed by the [[Interregnum]], during which no king could achieve universal recognition, allowing the princes to consolidate their holdings and become even more independent rulers. After 1257, the crown was contested between [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard of Cornwall]], who was supported by the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph party]], and [[Alfonso X of Castile]], who was recognized by the Hohenstaufen party but never set foot on German soil. After Richard's death in 1273, [[Rudolf I of Germany]], a minor pro-Staufen count, was elected. He was the first of the [[Habsburgs]] to hold a royal title, but he was never crowned emperor. After Rudolf's death in 1291, [[Adolf of Germany|Adolf]] and [[Albert I of Germany|Albert]] were two further weak kings who were never crowned emperor.

Albert was assassinated in 1308. Almost immediately, King Philip IV of France began aggressively seeking support for his brother, Charles of Valois, to be elected the next King of the Romans. Philip thought he had the backing of the French Pope Clement V (established at Avignon in 1309), and that his prospects of bringing the empire into the orbit of the French royal house were good. He lavishly spread French money in the hope of bribing the German electors. Although Charles of Valois had the backing of Henry, Archbishop of Cologne, a French supporter, many were not keen to see an expansion of French power, least of all Clement V. The principal rival to Charles appeared to be Rudolf, the Count Palatine.

Instead, [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]], of the House of Luxembourg, was elected with six votes at Frankfurt on 27 November 1308. Given his background, although he was a vassal of king Philip, Henry was bound by few national ties, an aspect of his suitability as a compromise candidate among the electors, the great territorial magnates who had lived without a crowned emperor for decades, and who were unhappy with both Charles and Rudolf. Henry of Cologne's brother, Baldwin, Archbishop of Trier, won over a number of the electors, including Henry, in exchange for some substantial concessions. Henry VII was crowned king at Aachen on 6 January 1309, and emperor by Pope Clement V on 29 June 1312 in Rome, ending the interregnum.

==== Changes in political structure ====

During the 13th century, a general structural change in how land was administered prepared the shift of political power towards the rising [[bourgeoisie]] at the expense of the aristocratic [[feudalism]] that would characterize the [[Late Middle Ages]]. The rise of the [[Free imperial city|cities]] and the emergence of the new [[Burgher (title)|burgher]] class eroded the societal, legal and economic order of feudalism.&lt;ref name="Rothstein1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley William Rothstein|title=Class, Culture, and Race in American Schools: A Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/?id=g0W8-Xsg_ssC&amp;pg=PA9|year=1995|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29102-9|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of personal duties, money increasingly became the common means to represent economic value in agriculture. Peasants were increasingly required to pay tribute to their lands. The concept of "property" began to replace more ancient forms of jurisdiction, although they were still very much tied together. In the territories (not at the level of the Empire), power became increasingly bundled: whoever owned the land had jurisdiction, from which other powers derived. However, that jurisdiction at the time did not include legislation, which was virtually non-existent until well into the 15th century. Court practice heavily relied on traditional customs or rules described as customary.

During this time territories began to transform into the predecessors of modern states. The process varied greatly among the various lands and was most advanced in those territories that were almost identical to the lands of the old Germanic tribes, ''e.g.'', Bavaria. It was slower in those scattered territories that were founded through imperial privileges.

In the 12th century the [[Hanseatic League]] established itself as a commercial and defensive alliance of the merchant [[guild]]s of towns and cities in the empire and  all over northern and central Europe. It dominated marine trade in the [[Baltic Sea]], the [[North Sea]] and along the connected navigable rivers. Each of the affiliated cities retained the legal system of its sovereign and, with the exception of the [[Free imperial city|Free imperial cities]], had only a limited degree of political autonomy.

=== Late Middle Ages ===

==== Rise of the territories after the Hohenstaufens ====
The difficulties in electing the king eventually led to the emergence of a fixed college of [[prince-elector]]s (''Kurfürsten''), whose composition and procedures were set forth in the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], which remained valid until 1806. This development probably best symbolizes the emerging duality between emperor and realm (''Kaiser und Reich''), which were no longer considered identical. The Golden Bull also set forth the system for election of the Holy Roman Emperor. The emperor now was to be elected by a majority rather than by consent of all seven electors. For electors the title became hereditary, and they were given the right to mint coins and to exercise jurisdiction. Also it was recommended that their sons learn the imperial languages – [[German language|German]], [[Latin]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Czech language|Czech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goldene Bulle (Zeumer, 1908) – Wikisource|url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Goldene_Bulle_%28Zeumer,_1908%29|website=de.wikisource.org|accessdate=6 April 2016|language=Latin|quote=Quapropter statuimus, ut illustrium principum, puta regis Boemie, comitis palatini Reni, ducis Saxonie et marchionis Brandemburgensis electorum filii vel heredes et successores, cum verisimiliter Theutonicum ydioma sibi naturaliter inditum scire presumantur et ab infancia didicisse, incipiendo a septimo etatis sue anno in gramatica, Italica ac Sclavica lingwis instruantur, ita quod infra quartum decimum etatis annum existant in talibus iuxta datam sibi a Deo graciam eruditi.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="langues"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Žůrek|first1=Václav|title=Les langues du roi.

The shift in power away from the emperor is also revealed in the way the post-Hohenstaufen kings attempted to sustain their power. Earlier, the Empire's strength (and finances) greatly relied on the Empire's own lands, the so-called ''Reichsgut'', which always belonged to the king of the day and included many Imperial Cities. After the 13th century, the relevance of the ''Reichsgut'' faded, even though some parts of it did remain until the Empire's end in 1806. Instead, the ''Reichsgut'' was increasingly pawned to local dukes, sometimes to raise money for the Empire, but more frequently to reward faithful duty or as an attempt to establish control over the dukes. The direct governance of the ''Reichsgut'' no longer matched the needs of either the king or the dukes.

The kings beginning with [[Rudolf I of Germany]] increasingly relied on the lands of their respective dynasties to support their power. In contrast with the ''Reichsgut'', which was mostly scattered and difficult to administer, these territories were relatively compact and thus easier to control. In 1282, Rudolf I thus lent Austria and [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]] to his own sons. In 1312, [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] of the [[House of Luxembourg]] was crowned as the first Holy Roman Emperor since Frederick II. After him all kings and emperors relied on the lands of their own family (''Hausmacht''): [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] of [[Wittelsbach]] (king 1314, emperor 1328–47) relied on his lands in Bavaria; [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] of Luxembourg, the grandson of Henry VII, drew strength from his own lands in Bohemia. It was thus increasingly in the king's own interest to strengthen the power of the territories, since the king profited from such a benefit in his own lands as well.

==== Imperial reform ====

[[File:Golden_Bull_of_1356.png|thumb|upright=1.25|The Holy Roman Empire when the Golden Bull of 1356 was signed]]

The "constitution" of the Empire still remained largely unsettled at the beginning of the 15th century. Although some procedures and institutions had been fixed, for example by the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], the rules of how the king, the electors, and the other dukes should cooperate in the Empire much depended on the personality of the respective king. It therefore proved somewhat damaging that [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg]] (king 1410, emperor 1433–1437) and [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III of Habsburg]] (king 1440, emperor 1452–1493) neglected the old core lands of the empire and mostly resided in their own lands. Without the presence of the king, the old institution of the ''[[Hoftag]]'', the assembly of the realm's leading men, deteriorated. The ''[[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]'' as a legislative organ of the Empire did not exist at that time. The dukes often conducted feuds against each other – feuds that, more often than not, escalated into local wars.

Simultaneously, the Catholic Church experienced crises of its own, with wide-reaching effects in the Empire. The conflict between several papal claimants (two [[anti-popes]] and the "legitimate" [[Papacy|Pope]]) ended only with the [[Council of Constance]] (1414–1418); after 1419 the Papacy directed much of its energy to suppressing the [[Hussites]]. The medieval idea of unifying all [[Christendom]] into a single political entity, with the Church and the Empire as its leading institutions, began to decline.

With these drastic changes, much discussion emerged in the 15th century about the Empire itself. Rules from the past no longer adequately described the structure of the time, and a reinforcement of earlier ''Landfrieden'' was urgently needed. During this time, the concept of "reform" emerged, in the original sense of the Latin verb ''re-formare'' – to regain an earlier shape that had been lost.

When [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] needed the dukes to finance a [[Austrian-Hungarian War (1477–1488)|war against Hungary in 1486]], and at the same time had his son (later [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]) elected king, he faced a demand from the united dukes for their participation in an Imperial Court. For the first time, the assembly of the electors and other dukes was now called the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] (German ''Reichstag'') (to be joined by the [[Imperial Free City|Imperial Free Cities]] later). While Frederick refused, his more conciliatory son finally convened the [[Diet at Worms in 1495]], after his father's death in 1493. Here, the king and the dukes agreed on four bills, commonly referred to as the [[Imperial Reform|''Reichsreform'' (Imperial Reform)]]: a set of legal acts to give the disintegrating Empire some structure. For example, this act produced the [[Imperial Circle Estates]] and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), institutions that would – to a degree – persist until the end of the Empire in 1806. It took a few more decades for the new regulation to gain universal acceptance and for the new court to begin functioning effectively; the Imperial Circles were finalized in 1512. The King also made sure that his own court, the ''Reichshofrat'', continued to operate in parallel to the ''Reichskammergericht''. Also in 1512, the Empire received its new title, the ''Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation'' ("Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation").

In 1516, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], grandfather of the future Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gC8O9GI9JX0C&amp;pg=PA81 |page=81 |title=Historical Dictionary of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation |isbn=9780810873933 |last1=Mullett |first1=Michael |date=30 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a combination of (1) the traditions of dynastic succession in Aragon, which permitted maternal inheritance with no precedence for female rule; (2) the insanity of Charles's mother, [[Joanna of Castile]]; and (3) the insistence by his remaining grandfather, [[Maximilian I of the Holy Roman Empire|Maximilian I]], that he take up his royal titles, Charles initiated his reign in Castile and Aragon, a union which evolved into [[Spanish Crown|Spain]], in conjunction with his mother. This ensured for the first time that all the realms of what is now Spain would be united by one monarch under one nascent Spanish crown. The founding territories retained their separate governance codes and laws. In 1519, already reigning as ''Carlos I'' in Spain, Charles took up the imperial title as ''Karl V''. The balance (and imbalance) between these separate inheritances would be defining elements of his reign and would ensure that personal union between the Spanish and German crowns would be short-lived. The latter would end up going to a more junior branch of the Habsburgs in the person of Charles's brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], while the senior branch continued to rule in Spain and in the Burgundian inheritance in the person of Charles's son, [[Philip II of Spain]].

In addition to conflicts between his Spanish and German inheritances, conflicts of religion would be another source of tension during the reign of Charles V. Before Charles's reign in the Holy Roman Empire began, in 1517, [[Martin Luther]] launched what would later be known as the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. At this time, many local dukes saw it as a chance to oppose the hegemony of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. The empire then became fatally divided along religious lines, with the north, the east, and many of the major cities – [[Strasbourg]], [[Frankfurt]], and [[Nuremberg]] – becoming [[Protestant]] while the southern and western regions largely remained [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]].

Charles V continued to battle the French and the Protestant princes in Germany for much of his reign. After his son Philip married [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary of England]], it appeared that France would be completely surrounded by Habsburg domains, but this hope proved unfounded when the marriage produced no children. In 1555, [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] was elected pope and took the side of France, whereupon an exhausted Charles finally gave up his hopes of a world Christian empire. He abdicated and divided his territories between Philip and Ferdinand of Austria. The [[Peace of Augsburg]] ended the war in Germany and accepted the existence of [[Protestantism]] in the form of [[Lutheranism]], while [[Calvinism]] was still not recognized. [[Anabaptist]], [[Arminian]] and other minor Protestant communities were also forbidden.

[[File:HolyRomanEmpire 1618.png|upright=1.1|thumb|Religion in the Holy Roman Empire on the eve of the [[Thirty Years' War]]]]
[[File:HRR 1648.png|thumb|upright=1.1|The Empire after the [[Peace of Westphalia]], 1648]]

Germany would enjoy relative peace for the next six decades. On the eastern front, the Turks continued to loom large as a threat, although war would mean further compromises with the Protestant princes, and so the Emperor sought to avoid it. In the west, the Rhineland increasingly fell under French influence. After the Dutch revolt against Spain erupted, the Empire remained neutral, ''de facto'' allowing the Netherlands to depart the empire in 1581, a secession acknowledged in 1648. A side effect was the [[Cologne War]], which ravaged much of the upper Rhine.

After Ferdinand died in 1564, his son [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] became Emperor, and like his father accepted the existence of Protestantism and the need for occasional compromise with it. Maximilian was succeeded in 1576 by [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], a strange man who preferred [[Ancient Greek philosophy|classical Greek philosophy]] to Christianity and lived an isolated existence in Bohemia. He became afraid to act when the Catholic Church was forcibly reasserting control in Austria and Hungary, and the Protestant princes became upset over this. Imperial power sharply deteriorated by the time of Rudolf's death in 1612. When Bohemians rebelled against the Emperor, the immediate result was the series of conflicts known as the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48), which devastated the Empire. Foreign powers, including France and Sweden, intervened in the conflict and strengthened those fighting Imperial power, but also seized considerable territory for themselves. The long conflict so bled the Empire that it never recovered its strength.

The actual end of the empire came in several steps. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years' War, gave the territories almost complete independence. [[Calvinism]] was now allowed, but [[Anabaptists]], [[Arminians]] and other Protestant communities would still lack any support and continue to be persecuted well until the end of the Empire. The [[Swiss Confederation]], which had already established quasi-independence in 1499, as well as the [[Northern Netherlands]], left the Empire. The [[Habsburg]] Emperors focused on consolidating their own estates in Austria and elsewhere.

At the [[Battle of Vienna]] (1683), the [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]], led by the Polish King [[John III Sobieski]], decisively defeated a large Turkish army, stopping the western Ottoman advance and leading to the eventual dismemberment of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in Europe. The army was half forces of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], mostly cavalry, and half forces of the Holy Roman Empire (German/Austrian), mostly infantry.

==== Prussia and Austria ====
{{Further|Austria–Prussia rivalry|Kingdom of Prussia|Habsburg Monarchy}}
By the rise of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Habsburgs were chiefly dependent on their [[Habsburg Monarchy|hereditary lands]] to counter the rise of [[Prussia]], some of whose territories lay inside the Empire. Throughout the 18th century, the Habsburgs were embroiled in various European conflicts, such as the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701-1714), the [[War of the Polish Succession]] (1733-1735), and the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740-1748). The [[German dualism]] between [[Austria]] and [[Prussia]] dominated the empire's history after 1740.

==== French Revolutionary Wars and final dissolution ====
{{Main|Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire}}
[[File:HRR 1789 EN.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The Empire on the eve of the [[French Revolution]], 1789]]
From 1792 onwards, [[French Revolutionary Wars|revolutionary France]] was at war with various parts of the Empire intermittently.

The [[German mediatization]] was the series of [[mediatization]]s and [[secularization]]s that occurred between 1795 and 1814, during the latter part of the era of the [[French Revolution]] and then the [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleonic Era]]. "Mediatization" was the process of [[annexation|annexing]] the lands of one [[Imperial State|imperial estate]] to another, often leaving the annexed some rights. For example, the estates of the [[Imperial Knight]]s were formally mediatized in 1806, having ''de facto'' been seized by the great [[territorial state]]s in 1803 in the so-called ''[[Rittersturm]]''. "Secularization" was the abolition of the temporal power of an [[ecclesiastical]] ruler such as a [[bishop]] or an [[abbot]] and the annexation of the secularized territory to a secular territory.

The empire was dissolved on 6 August 1806, when the last Holy Roman Emperor [[Francis II of the Holy Roman Empire|Francis II]] (from 1804, Emperor Francis I of Austria) abdicated, following a military defeat by the French under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (see [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]). Napoleon reorganized much of the Empire into the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a [[satellite state|French satellite]]. Francis' [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] survived the demise of the empire, continuing to reign as [[Emperor of Austria|Emperors of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary|Kings of Hungary]] until the Habsburg empire's final dissolution in 1918 in the [[aftermath of World War I]].

The Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine was replaced by a new union, the [[German Confederation]], in 1815, following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It lasted until 1866 when Prussia founded the [[North German Confederation]], a forerunner of the [[German Empire]] which united the German-speaking territories outside of Austria and Switzerland under Prussian leadership in 1871. This state developed into [[Federal Republic of Germany|modern Germany]].

The only princely member state of the Holy Roman Empire that has preserved its status as a monarchy until today is the [[Principality of Liechtenstein]]. The only Free Imperial Cities still being states within Germany are [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]]. All other historic member states of the HRE were either dissolved or are republican successor states to their princely predecessor states.

== Institutions ==
The Holy Roman Empire was neither a centralized [[State (polity)|state]] nor a [[nation-state]]. Instead, it was divided into dozens – eventually hundreds – of individual entities governed by [[king]]s,&lt;ref&gt;The only prince allowed to call himself "king" of a territory in the Empire was the [[King of Bohemia]] (after 1556 usually the Emperor himself). Some other princes were kings by virtue of kingdoms they controlled outside of the Empire&lt;/ref&gt; [[duke]]s, [[count]]s, [[bishop]]s, [[abbot]]s, and other rulers, collectively known as [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|prince]]s. There were also some areas ruled directly by the Emperor. At no time could the Emperor simply issue decrees and govern autonomously over the Empire. His power was severely restricted by the various local leaders.

From the [[High Middle Ages]] onwards, the Holy Roman Empire was marked by an uneasy coexistence with the princes of the local territories who were struggling to take [[power (sociology)|power]] away from it. To a greater extent than in other medieval kingdoms such as [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]], the emperors were unable to gain much control over the lands that they formally owned. Instead, to secure their own position from the threat of being deposed, emperors were forced to grant more and more autonomy to local rulers, both nobles and bishops. This process began in the 11th century with the [[Investiture Controversy]] and was more or less concluded with the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Several Emperors attempted to reverse this steady dilution of their authority but were thwarted both by the [[papacy]] and by the princes of the Empire.

=== Imperial estates ===
{{Main|Imperial State}}
The number of territories represented in the Imperial Diet was considerable, numbering about 300 at the time of the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Many of these ''[[Kleinstaaterei|Kleinstaaten]]'' ("little states") covered no more than a few square miles, and/or included several non-contiguous pieces, so the Empire was often called a ''Flickenteppich'' ("[[Patchwork|patchwork carpet]]").
An entity was considered a ''Reichsstand'' (imperial estate) if, according to [[feudal law]], it had no authority above it except the Holy Roman Emperor himself. The imperial estates comprised:
* Territories ruled by a hereditary nobleman, such as a prince, archduke, duke, or count.
* Territories in which secular authority was held by a clerical dignitary, such as an archbishop, bishop, or abbot. Such a cleric was a [[prince of the church]]. In the common case of a [[prince-bishop]], this temporal territory (called a prince-bishopric) frequently overlapped with his often-larger ecclesiastical [[diocese]], giving the bishop both civil and clerical powers. Examples are the prince-archbishoprics of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Archbishopric of Trier|Trier]], and [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]].
* [[Free imperial city|Free imperial cities]] and [[Imperial Village|Imperial villages]], which were subject only to the jurisdiction of the emperor.
* The scattered estates of the free [[Imperial Knight]]s and [[Imperial Count]]s, immediate to the Emperor but unrepresented in the Imperial Diet.

A sum total of 1,500 Imperial estates has been reckoned.&lt;ref&gt;Die Reichs-Matrikel aller Kreise Nebst den Usual-Matrikeln des Kaiserlichen und Reichskammergerichts, Ulm 1796.&lt;/ref&gt; For a list of ''Reichsstände'' in 1792, see [[List of Imperial Diet participants (1792)]].

=== King of the Romans ===
{{Main|King of the Romans}}
[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (189)2.JPG|thumb|The [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|crown of the Holy Roman Empire]] (2nd half of the 10th century), now held in the [[Schatzkammer (Vienna)]]]]

A prospective Emperor had first to be elected [[King of the Romans]] (Latin: ''Rex Romanorum''; German: ''römischer König''). [[List of German monarchs|German kings]] had been elected since the 9th century; at that point they were chosen by the leaders of the five most important tribes (the [[Salian Franks]] of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Ripuarian Franks]] of [[Franconia]], [[Saxons]], [[Bavaria]]ns, and [[Swabia]]ns). In the Holy Roman Empire, the main dukes and bishops of the kingdom elected the King of the Romans. In 1356, Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] issued the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]], which limited the [[prince-elector|electors]] to seven: the [[King of Bohemia]], the [[Count Palatine of the Rhine]], the [[Duke of Saxony]], the [[Margrave of Brandenburg]], and the archbishops of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Mainz]], and [[Trier]]. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Duke of Bavaria]] was given the right to vote as the eighth elector, and the [[Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] (colloquially, Hanover) was granted a ninth electorate; additionally, the Napoleonic Wars resulted in several electorates being reallocated, but these new electors never voted before the Empire's dissolution. A candidate for election would be expected to offer concessions of land or money to the electors in order to secure their vote.

After being elected, the King of the Romans could theoretically claim the title of "Emperor" only after being crowned by the [[Pope]]. In many cases, this took several years while the King was held up by other tasks: frequently he first had to resolve conflicts in rebellious northern Italy or was quarreling with the Pope himself. Later Emperors dispensed with the papal coronation altogether, being content with the styling ''Emperor-Elect'': the last Emperor to be crowned by the Pope was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1530.

The Emperor had to be male and of noble blood. No law required him to be a Catholic, but as the majority of the Electors adhered to this faith, no Protestant was ever elected. Whether and to what degree he had to be German was disputed among the Electors, contemporary experts in constitutional law, and the public. During the Middle Ages, some Kings and Emperors were not of German origin, but since the Renaissance, German heritage was regarded as vital for a candidate in order to be eligible for imperial office.&lt;ref name="Hirschi"&gt;Caspar Hirschi, ''Wettkampf der Nationen'', Wallstein Verlag 2005, Göttingen, p.&amp;nbsp;393–399.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'') ===
{{Main|Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)}}
[[File:Balduineum Wahl Heinrich VII.jpg|thumb|The Seven [[Prince-elector]]s (''[[Codex Balduini Trevirorum]]'', c. 1340)]]

The Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'', or ''Reichsversammlung'') was not a legislative body as we understand it today, as its members envisioned it more like a central forum where it was more important to negotiate than to decide.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Malettke, ''Les relations entre la France et le Saint-Empire au XVIIe siècle'', Honoré Champion, Paris, 2001, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Diet was theoretically superior to the emperor himself. It was divided into three classes. The first class, the [[Council of Electors]], consisted of the electors, or the princes who could vote for King of the Romans. The second class, the [[Council of Princes]], consisted of the other princes. The Council of Princes was divided into two "benches", one for secular rulers and one for ecclesiastical ones. Higher-ranking princes had individual votes, while lower-ranking princes were grouped into "colleges" by geography. Each college had one vote.

The third class was the Council of Imperial Cities, which was divided into two colleges: [[Swabia]] and the [[Rhine]]. The Council of Imperial Cities was not fully equal with the others; it could not vote on several matters such as the admission of new territories. The representation of the Free Cities at the Diet had become common since the late Middle Ages. Nevertheless, their participation was formally acknowledged only as late as 1648 with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] ending the [[Thirty Years' War]].

=== Imperial courts ===
The Empire also had two courts: the ''Reichshofrat'' (also known in English as the [[Aulic Council]]) at the court of the King/Emperor, and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), established with the [[Imperial Reform]] of 1495 by Maximillian I. The Reichskammergericht and the Auclic Council were the two highest judicial instances in the Old Empire. The Imperial Chamber court's composition was determined by both the Holy Roman Emperor and the subject states of the Empire. Within this court, the Emperor appointed the chief justice, always a highborn aristocrat, several divisional chief judges, and some of the other puisne judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reichskammergericht.de/index_e.htm|title=http://www.reichskammergericht.de/index_e.htm|website=reichskammergericht.de|access-date=2020-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aulic Council held standing over many judicial disputes of state, both in concurrence with the Imperial Chamber court and exclusively on their own. The provinces Imperial Chamber Court extended to breaches of the public peace, cases of arbitrary distraint or imprisonment, pleas which concerned the treasury, violations of the Emperor's decrees or the laws passed by the Imperial Diet, disputes about property between [[Imperial Estate|immediate tenants of the Empire]] or the subjects of different rulers, and finally suits against immediate tenants of the Empire, with the exception of criminal charges and matters relating to imperial fiefs, which went to the [[Aulic Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/10.1093/ww/9780199540891.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-194658|chapter=Chisholm, Hugh, (22 Feb. 1866–29 Sept. 1924), Editor of the Encyclopædia Britannica (10th, 11th and 12th editions)|website=WHO'S WHO &amp; WHO WAS WHO|language=en|doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u194658|access-date=2020-04-15|title=Who Was Who|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imperial circles ===
[[File:Map of the Imperial Circles (1512)-en.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Empire showing division into Circles in 1512]]

As part of the Imperial Reform, six [[Imperial Circle]]s were established in 1500; four more were established in 1512. These were regional groupings of most (though not all) of the various states of the Empire for the purposes of defense, imperial taxation, supervision of coining, peace-keeping functions, and public security. Each circle had its own parliament, known as a ''Kreistag'' ("Circle Diet"), and one or more directors, who coordinated the affairs of the circle. Not all imperial territories were included within the imperial circles, even after 1512; the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were excluded, as were [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]], the imperial fiefs in northern Italy, the lands of the [[Imperial Knights]], and certain other small territories like the [[Lordship of Jever]].

=== Army ===
{{Main|Army of the Holy Roman Empire}}
The [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]] (German ''Reichsarmee'', ''Reichsheer'' or ''Reichsarmatur''; Latin ''exercitus imperii'') was created in 1422 and came to an end even before the Empire as the result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It must not be confused with the [[Imperial Army (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Army]] (''Kaiserliche Armee'') of the Emperor.

Despite appearances to the contrary, the Army of the Empire did not constitute a permanent [[standing army]] that was always at the ready to fight for the Empire. When there was danger, an Army of the Empire was mustered from among the elements constituting it,&lt;ref&gt;André Corvisier, John Childs, ''A dictionary of military history and the art of war'' (1994), p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; in order to conduct an imperial military campaign or ''Reichsheerfahrt''. In practice, the imperial troops often had local allegiances stronger than their loyalty to the Emperor.

=== Administrative centres ===
Throughout the first half of its history the Holy Roman Empire was reigned by a [[Itinerant court|travelling court]]. Kings and emperors toured between the numerous [[Kaiserpfalz]]es (Imperial palaces), usually resided for several weeks or months and furnished local legal matters, law and administration. Most rulers maintained one or a number of favourites Imperial palace sites, where they would advance development and spent most of their time: Charlemagne ([[Aachen]] from 794), Frederick II ([[Palermo]] 1220–1254), Wittelsbacher ([[Munich]] 1328–1347 and 1744–1745), Habsburger ([[Prague]] 1355–1437 and 1576–1611) and ([[Vienna]] 1438–1576, 1611–1740 and 1745–1806).&lt;ref name="cantor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BibliothekEhlers2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Caspar Ehlers, Helmut Flachenecker, Bernd Päffgen, Rudolf Schieffer|title=Die deutschen Königspfalzen.

These sites served however only as the individual residence for a particular sovereign. A number of cities held official status, where the [[Imperial Estates]] would summon at [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]s, the [[deliberative assembly]] of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Gagliardo, ''Reich and Nation. The Holy Roman Empire as Idea and Reality, 1763–1806'', Indiana University Press, 1980, p. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bro/&gt;

The [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] (''Reichstag'') resided variously in [[Paderborn]], [[Bad Lippspringe]], [[Ingelheim am Rhein]], [[Diedenhofen]] (now [[Thionville]]), [[Aachen]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Forchheim]], [[Trebur]], [[Fritzlar]], [[Ravenna]], [[Quedlinburg]], [[Dortmund]], [[Verona]], [[Minden]], [[Mainz]], [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Merseburg]], [[Goslar]], [[Würzburg]], [[Bamberg]], [[Schwäbisch Hall]], [[Augsburg]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Quierzy-sur-Oise]], [[Speyer]], [[Gelnhausen]], [[Erfurt]], [[Cheb|Eger]] (now [[Cheb]]), [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]], [[Lindau]], [[Freiburg]], [[Cologne]], [[Konstanz]] and [[Trier]] before it was moved permanently to [[Regensburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Anton Schindling (1986), "The Development of the Eternal Diet in Regensburg", ''The Journal of Modern History'', 58:64. {{doi|10.1086/243149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 15th century the elected emperor was [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]] and anointed by the Pope in [[Rome]], among some exceptions in [[Ravenna]], [[Bologna]] and [[Reims]]. Since 1508 (emperor Maximilian I) [[Imperial election]]s took place in Frankfurt am Main, [[Augsburg]], [[Rhens]], [[Cologne]] or [[Regensburg]].&lt;ref name=erbe&gt;Michael Erbe: Die Habsburger 1493–1918.

Beck|isbn=978-3-406-30278-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1497 the [[Aulic Council]] (''Reichshofrat'') was established in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name="HochedlingerMata2019"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Hochedlinger|author2=Petr Mata|author3=Thomas Winkelbauer|title=Verwaltungsgeschichte der Habsburgermonarchie in der Frühen Neuzeit: Band 1: Hof und Dynastie, Kaiser und Reich, Zentralverwaltungen, Kriegswesen und landesfürstliches Finanzwesen|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-Y6dDwAAQBAJ|date=17 June 2019|publisher=Böhlau Verlag Wien|isbn=978-3-205-23246-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1495 the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' was established, which variously resided in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Augsburg]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Regensburg]], [[Speyer]] and [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]] before it was moved permanently to [[Wetzlar]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Imperial Chamber |volume=14 |pages=341–342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign relations ===
The [[Habsburg]] royal family had its own diplomats to represent its interests. The larger principalities in the HRE, beginning around 1648, also did the same. The HRE did not have its own dedicated ministry of foreign affairs and therefore the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] had no control over these diplomats; occasionally the Diet criticised them.&lt;ref name=Wilsonp70&gt;Wilson, Peter H. ''The Holy Roman Empire 1495–1806''. Macmillan International Higher Education. 21 June 2011. {{ISBN|0230344593}}, 9780230344594. p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Regensburg]] served as the site of the Diet, France and, in the late 1700s, Russia, had diplomatic representatives there.&lt;ref name=Wilsonp70/&gt; Denmark, Great Britain, and Sweden had land holdings in Germany and so had representation in the Diet itself.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Peter H. ''The Holy Roman Empire 1495–1806''. Macmillan International Higher Education. 21 June 2011. {{ISBN|0230344593}}, 9780230344594. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The Netherlands also had envoys in Regensburg. Regensburg was the place where envoys met as it was where representatives of the Diet could be reached.&lt;ref name=Harterp122etal/&gt;&lt;!--Note that page 122 discusses which countries sent envoys, and page 132 discusses why Regensburg was chosen--&gt;

== Demographics ==
===Population===
Overall population figures for the Holy Roman Empire are extremely vague and vary widely. Given the political fragmentation of the Empire, there were no central agencies that could compile such figures. According to an overgenerous contemporary estimate of the Austrian War Archives for the first decade of the 18th century, the Empire, including Bohemia and the Spanish Netherlands, had a population of close to 28&amp;nbsp;million with a breakdown as follows:&lt;ref&gt;G. Benecke, ''Society and Politics in Germany, 1500–1750'', Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1974, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

* 65 ecclesiastical states with 14 percent of the total land area and 12 percent of the population;
* 45 dynastic principalities with 80 percent of the land and 80 percent of the population;
* 60 dynastic counties and lordships with 3 percent of the land and 3.5 percent of the population;
* 60 imperial towns with 1 percent of the land and 3.5 percent of the population;
* Imperial knights' territories, numbering into the several hundreds, with 2 percent of the land and 1 percent of the population.

German demographic historians have traditionally worked on estimates of the population of the Holy Roman Empire based on assumed population within the frontiers of Germany in 1871 or 1914. More recent estimates use less outdated criteria, but they remain guesswork. One estimate based on the frontiers of Germany in 1870 gives a population of some 15–17&amp;nbsp;million around 1600, declined to 10–13&amp;nbsp;million around 1650 (following the Thirty Years' War). Other historians who work on estimates of the population of the early modern Empire suggest the population declined from 20&amp;nbsp;million to some 16–17&amp;nbsp;million by 1650.&lt;ref&gt;Whaley, vol. I, p. 633.&lt;/ref&gt;

A credible estimate for 1800 gives 27&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants for the Empire, with an overall breakdown as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Whaley, vol. II, p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

* 9&amp;nbsp;million Austrian subjects (including Silesia, Bohemia and Moravia);
* 4&amp;nbsp;million Prussian subjects;
* 14–15&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants for the rest of the Empire.

=== Religion ===
[[File:Druck Augsburger Reichsfrieden.jpg|thumb|upright|Front page of the [[Peace of Augsburg]], which laid the legal groundwork for two co-existing religious confessions ([[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Lutheranism]]) in the German-speaking states of the Holy Roman Empire]]
[[Roman Catholicism]] constituted the single official religion of the Empire until 1555. The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] was always a Roman Catholic.

[[Lutheranism]] was officially recognized in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] of 1555, and [[Calvinism]] in the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648. Those two constituted the only officially recognized [[Protestant]] denominations, while various other Protestant confessions such as [[Anabaptism]], [[Arminianism]], etc. coexisted illegally within the Empire. Anabaptism came in a variety of denominations, including [[Mennonites]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren]], [[Hutterites]], the [[Amish]], and multiple other groups.

Following the Peace of Augsburg, the official religion of a territory was determined by the principle [[cujus regio, ejus religio]] according to which a ruler's religion determined that of his subjects. The Peace of Westphalia abrogated that principle by stipulating that the official religion of a territory was to be what it had been on 1 January 1624, considered to have been a "normal year". Henceforth, the conversion of a ruler to another faith did not entail the conversion of his subjects. In addition, all Protestant subjects of a Catholic ruler and vice versa were guaranteed the rights that they had enjoyed on that date. While the adherents of a territory's official religion enjoyed the right of public worship, the others were allowed the right of private worship (in chapels without either spires or bells). In theory, no one was to be discriminated against or excluded from commerce, trade, craft or public burial on grounds of religion. For the first time, the permanent nature of the division between the Christian Churches of the empire was more or less assumed.&lt;ref&gt;Whaley (2012), vol. I, p. 624–625.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a [[History of the Jews in Germany#In the Holy Roman Empire|Jewish minority]] existed in the Holy Roman Empire.
