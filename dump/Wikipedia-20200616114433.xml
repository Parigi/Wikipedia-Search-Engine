The '''Xbox One''' is an [[eighth generation of video game consoles|eighth-generation]] [[home video game console]] developed by [[Microsoft]]. Announced in May 2013, it is the successor to [[Xbox 360]] and the third console in the [[Xbox#Consoles|Xbox series of video game consoles]]. It was first released in North America, parts of Europe, Australia, and South America in November 2013, and in Japan, China, and other European countries in September 2014. It is the first Xbox game console to be released in China, specifically in the [[Shanghai Free-Trade Zone]]. Microsoft marketed the device as an "all-in-one entertainment system", hence the name 'Xbox One'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vg247.com/2013/05/28/xbox-one-microsoft-exec-explains-consoles-name/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Tim|title=Xbox ONE: 'The ultimate all-in-one home entertainment system': Microsoft finally unveils its latest console|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/xbox-one-the-ultimate-allinone-home-entertainment-system-microsoft-finally-unveils-its-latest-console-8626177.html|accessdate=May 23, 2013|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print|date=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Xbox One mainly competes against [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii U]] and [[Nintendo Switch|Switch]].

Moving away from its predecessor's [[PowerPC]]-based [[Computer architecture|architecture]], the Xbox One marks a shift back to the [[x86]] architecture used in the [[Xbox (console)|original Xbox]]; it features an [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[Accelerated Processing Unit]] (APU) built around the [[x86-64]] [[instruction set]]. Xbox One's [[Xbox One controller|controller]] was redesigned over the Xbox 360's, with a redesigned body, [[D-pad]], and triggers capable of delivering directional [[Haptic technology|haptic feedback]]. The console places an increased emphasis on [[cloud computing]], as well as [[social networking]] features, and the ability to [[digital video recorder|record]] and share video clips or screenshots from gameplay, or [[Screencasting|live-stream]] directly to streaming services such as [[Mixer (service)|Mixer]] and [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]]. Games can also be played off-console via a local area network on supported [[Windows 10]] devices. The console can play [[Blu-ray Disc]], and [[video overlay|overlay]] live television programming from an existing [[set-top box]] or a digital tuner for [[digital terrestrial television]] with an enhanced [[electronic program guide|program guide]]. The console optionally included a redesigned [[Kinect]] sensor, marketed as the "Kinect 2.0", providing improved [[motion sensing|motion tracking]] and [[Speech recognition|voice recognition]].

The Xbox One received generally positive reviews for its refined controller design, multimedia features, and voice navigation. Its quieter and cooler design was praised for making the console more reliable than its predecessor on-launch, but the console was generally criticized for running games at a technically lower graphical level than the PlayStation 4. Its original user interface was panned for being nonintuitive, although changes made to it and other aspects of the console's software post-launch received a positive reception. Its Kinect received praise for its improved motion-tracking accuracy, its face recognition logins, and its voice commands.

The original Xbox One model was succeeded by the [[#Xbox One S|Xbox One S]] in 2016, which has a smaller form factor and support for [[HDR10]] [[high-dynamic-range video]], as well as support for [[4K resolution|4K]] video playback and [[Video scaler|upscaling]] of games from [[1080p]] to 4K. It was praised for its smaller size, its on-screen visual improvements, and its lack of an external power supply, but its regressions such as the lack of a native Kinect port were noted. A high-end model, named [[#Xbox One X|Xbox One X]], was unveiled in June 2017 and released in November; it features upgraded hardware specifications and support for rendering games at 4K resolution. It will be succeeded by the upcoming [[Xbox Series X]] consoles in late 2020.

The Xbox One is the successor to Xbox 360, Microsoft's previous video game console, which was introduced in 2005 as part of the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/39629/waiting-for-the-xbox-360|title=Waiting for the Xbox 360|first=Chris|last=Remo|work=[[Shacknews]]|publisher=Gamerhub|date=November 21, 2005|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the 360 had received a number of small hardware revisions to reduce the unit's size and improve its reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/videos/2013/06/18/unboxing-the-xbox-360-super-slim|title=Unboxing the Xbox 360 Super-Slim|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=June 18, 2013|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Microsoft's Chris Lewis stated that the 360 was about "halfway" through its lifecycle; this was aided by the introduction of the [[Kinect]] motion sensor that year, which Lewis stated would extend the lifecycle by five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108040432/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/308963/ms-xbox-360-about-halfway-through-its-lifecycle|archivedate=November 8, 2011 | url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/308963/ms-xbox-360-about-halfway-through-its-lifecycle/ | title=Kinect to extend Xbox 360 lifecycle by five years | publisher=[[Future plc]]| work=[[Computer &amp; Video Games]] | date=June 10, 2010 | accessdate=June 26, 2013 | last=Martin | first=Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial unveiling and launch===
Prior to the official unveiling, rumors had circulated that the next Xbox console would be an "always on" system requiring a persistent Internet connection, though Microsoft had not confirmed this. This had drawn some concerns from consumers, which were heightened when [[Xbox Game Studios|Microsoft Studios]] employee Adam Orth stated in a [[Twitter]] message in April 2013 that said "Sorry, I don't get the drama around having an 'always on' console...Every device now is 'always on.' That's the world we live in. #dealwithit". Orth's message drew further ire towards Microsoft, with concerns about [[digital rights management]] and practices against the sale of used games with an "always on" unit.

Spencer stated that several employees complained to him that they felt this presentation had "blow[n] up all the good work that [they]'ve done by talking about the product in a way that's not really matching what the soul of an Xbox console is about and what [their] customers are looking for from [Microsoft]".&lt;ref name="gamespot spencer aug19"/&gt;

As a result of the negative feedback from the May presentation, the press event for the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013|E3 2013]] focused on the video game functionality of the Xbox One first and foremost; Don Mattrick, Microsoft's president of Interactive Entertainment Business at the time, described the event as "all about the games".&lt;ref name="gamespot spencer aug19"/&gt;&lt;ref name=geek-onesmartglass/&gt; At the event, Microsoft announced that the console would be released in 21 different markets on November 22, 2013, but this was later amended down to 13.&lt;ref name="launchdate" /&gt;&lt;ref name=microsoft-ign/&gt; The change, which pushed the release date for the other eight markets to 2014, was attributed to unforeseen complexity in [[internationalization and localization|localizing]] the device's voice recognition capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conditt |first=Jessica |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/08/27/report-xbox-one-regional-delays-due-to-kinect-localization-issu/ |title=Report: Xbox One regional delays due to Kinect localization issues |work=[[Joystiq]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=August 14, 2013 |accessdate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in September 2014, the Xbox One was released in 26 markets, including remaining markets in Europe, the Japanese market, and Middle Eastern markets.&lt;ref name="launchdate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xbox.com/2013/08/xbox-one-confirmed-markets |title=Xbox One Launch Markets Confirmed |author=Xbox Leadership Team|work=Xbox Wire|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=August 14, 2013 |accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=microsoft-ign&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/14/microsoft-downscales-xbox-one-2013-launch-to-13-markets|title=Microsoft Downscale Xbox One 2013 Launch to 13 Markets|first=Chris|last=Pereira|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=August 14, 2015|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnet-26&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.cnet.com/news/xbox-one-to-hit-26-new-countries-in-september/ | title =  Xbox One 26 new markets|work=[[CNET]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date = March 18, 2014 | accessdate = March 23, 2014 | first = Jon| last = Skillings }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.xbox.com/2014/03/xbox-one-new-markets | title = Xbox One Coming to 26 New Markets in September | date = March 18, 2014 | accessdate = March 18, 2014 |work=Xbox Wire|publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChinaRelease"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xbox.com/2014/07/xbox-one-launch-in-china-september|title=Xbox One to Launch Next Generation of Gaming in China September 23|website=Xbox Wire|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=July 30, 2014|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft initially announced a different game licensing scheme for Xbox One than what was used upon its release: all games, including those purchased at retail, would be bound to the user's Xbox Live account. Users could access their purchased games from any other Xbox One console, play games without their disc once installed, and allow users to "share" their games with up to ten designated "family" members. If a [[Video game publisher|publisher]] allowed a game to be traded or resold, users could do this at "participating retailers", and could also transfer a game directly to any Xbox Live friend on their list for at least 30 days, but only once per game. To synchronize licenses, the console would be required to [[Phoning home|connect to the internet once every 24 hours]]; if the console could not connect, all games would be disabled until the console was connected again.&lt;ref name="official_usedgames"/&gt;&lt;ref name=XboxOneReceptionInternetMay2013Venturebeat&gt;{{cite news |title=Deal with it: Xbox One requires an Internet connection |first=Jeffrey|last=Grubb|publisher=[[VentureBeat]] |url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/05/21/deal-with-it-xbox-one-requires-an-internet-connection/ |date=May 21, 2013 |accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="official_licensing"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/license | title = How Games Licensing Works on Xbox One |work=Xbox Wire| publisher =[[343 Industries]]|date=June 6, 2013|accessdate = June 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaction to this [[digital rights management]] scheme was extremely negative in light of the previous concerns about the "always on" console from earlier in the year. Critics felt that the changes would infringe on consumers' [[First-sale doctrine|first-sale rights]] for games purchased on physical media, as games would only be [[Software license|licensed]] to users rather than sold, and the disc itself would only be used to install the game and not confer ownership of its license or permission to resell. Microsoft also stated that game publishers would decide whether the physical copies of their games would be eligible for resale, and could impose restrictions or activation fees on second-hand copies of games. In addition, loaning or renting games wasn't going to be possible at the console's launch and Microsoft was "exploring the possibilities" with its partners.&lt;ref name="drm180"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/update|title=Your Feedback Matters{{Snd}} Update on Xbox One|work=Xbox|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=June 19, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=XboxOneReceptionMay2013Cnet&gt;{{cite news |title=Used games are here to stay with Xbox One but details hazy |first=Shara|last=Tibken |work=[[CNET]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-9020_7-57585544-222/used-games-are-here-to-stay-with-xbox-one-but-details-hazy/ |date=May 21, 2013 |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=XboxOneReceptionMay2013Joystiq&gt;{{cite news |title=Xbox One will definitely be in used games market, details still blurry |first=Alexander|last=Sliwinski |work=[[Joystiq]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/05/22/xbox-one-will-definitely-be-in-used-games-market-details-still/ |date=May 22, 2013 |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-06-07-microsoft-kills-game-ownership-and-expects-us-to-smile | title = Microsoft kills game ownership and expects us to smile | accessdate = June 7, 2013 | date = June 7, 2013 | first = Tom | last = Bramwell | work = [[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nowgamer.com/features/1955108/xbox_one_its_for_publishers_not_for_you.html | title = Xbox One: It's Made For Publishers, Not For You | first = Ryan | last = King | accessdate = June 7, 2013 | date = June 7, 2013 | publisher = NowGamer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/indie-retailers-desperate-for-xbox-one-pre-owned-answers/0116813 | title = Indie retailers desperate for Xbox One pre-owned answers | work = [[MCV (magazine)|MCV]] | publisher = [[NewBay Media]] | date = June 7, 2013 | accessdate = June 7, 2013 | first = Ben | last = Parfitt | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130611131821/http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/indie-retailers-desperate-for-xbox-one-pre-owned-answers/0116813 | archive-date = June 11, 2013 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Martin|last=Gaston|title=Preowned games on Xbox One decided by publisher|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/preowned-games-on-xbox-one-decided-by-publisher/1100-6409422/|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=December 13, 2016|date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[GameSpot]]'' editor Tom Mcshea went on to say that Microsoft had become [[Consumer protection|anti-consumerist]], trying to "punish their loyal customers" with strict restrictions, and that "by saying no to the used game restrictions and always-online that Microsoft is so happily implementing on the Xbox One, Sony has elevated the [[PlayStation 4]] as the console to grab this holiday season."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McShea|first=Tom|title=Sony's Triumphant Night|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-triumphant-night/1100-6409715/|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=December 13, 2016|date=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xbox Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer Yusuf Mehdi explained that the system was built with digital distribution in mind, but that Microsoft wanted to maintain the availability of games on physical media.

Microsoft also backtracked on a similarly controversial requirement for the [[Kinect]] sensor to be plugged into Xbox One at all times for it to function. Privacy advocates argued that Kinect sensor data could be used for [[targeted advertising]], and to perform unauthorized [[surveillance]] on users. In response to these claims, Microsoft reiterated that Kinect voice recognition and motion tracking can be disabled by users, that Kinect data cannot be used for advertising per its [[privacy policy]], and that the console would not redistribute user-generated content without permission. Alongside the above changes, the Xbox One by launch did not require the Kinect to be plugged in to operate, though the initial bundles still included the Kinect device.&lt;ref name=polygon-xbox1privacy&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy concerns threaten to overshadow Microsoft's new console|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/5/4398440/privacy-microsoft-xbox-one|first=Brian|last=Crecente|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=June 5, 2013|accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-kinectads"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/27/4370676/microsoft-kinect-tv-monitoring-achievements-ads | title=Microsoft may award achievements for watching TV and ads by monitoring you with Kinect |first=T.C.|last=Sottek|publisher=[[Vox Media]] | work=[[The Verge]] |date=May 27, 2013|accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon-privacyresponse"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/6/4403926/kinect-on-xbox-one-will-not-record-or-upload-your-conversations | title=Kinect on Xbox One will not record or upload your conversations, Microsoft says |first=Michael|last=McWhertor|publisher=[[Vox Media]] | work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=June 6, 2013|accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=XboxOneReceptionInternetMay2013Pcmag&gt;{{cite news |title=Hello Xbox One, Goodbye Freedom |first=Will|last=Greenwald |work=[[PC Magazine]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2419320,00.asp |date=May 22, 2013 |accessdate=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/xbox-one-wont-actually-need-kinect-plugged-in-microso-1113142909|title=Kinect No Longer Mandatory For Xbox One (But Will Still Come With It) [UPDATE]|first=Jason|last=Schreier|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Univision Communications]]|date=August 12, 2013|accessdate=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ext-onekinect"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/163796-xbox-one-no-longer-requires-kinect-but-itll-still-come-in-the-box-and-youll-still-pay-500 | title=Xbox One no longer requires Kinect, but it'll still come in the box, and you'll still pay $500 |first=Sebastian|last=Anthony|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]| work=[[ExtremeTech]]|date=August 13, 2013|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these pre-launch changes and a belief that Microsoft's initial decisions for the console were in poor judgement, journalists and consumers jokingly gave the Xbox One nicknames such as "Xbox 180", in reference to the Xbox 360 and Microsoft's decision to reverse its controversial decisions, and "Xbone", suggesting that the company was "[[bone throwing|throwing a bone]]" to consumers by making these changes.&lt;ref name=techradar-throwbone&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft throws next-gen gaming an Xbone|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/microsoft-throws-next-gen-gaming-an-xbone-1180665|first=Hugh|last=Langley|work=[[TechRadar]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=September 12, 2013|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft's Xbox 180: Upcoming Xbox One to drop DRM restrictions, internet requirement after public backlash|url=https://news.yahoo.com/microsoft-xbox-180-upcoming-xbox-one-drop-drm-204824307.html|first=Brad|last=Reed|work=[[Yahoo!

[[File:Microsoft-Xbox-One-S-Console-FL.jpg|thumb|The Xbox One S features a smaller casing and other design changes over the original model.]]
The original Xbox One's exterior casing consists of a two-tone "liquid black" finish; with half finished in a matte grey, and the other in a glossier black. The matte side of the top of the console consists of a large air vent. The design was intended to evoke a more entertainment-oriented and simplified look than previous iterations of the console; among other changes, the LED rings used by Xbox 360 are replaced by a glowing white Xbox logo used to communicate the system's status to the user.&lt;ref name=polygon-onedesign&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft explains the design of the Xbox One|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/5/21/4352870/xbox-one-design|first=Matt|last=Leone|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=May 21, 2013|accessdate=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the overall ventilation design of the console, the original Xbox One is designed to only sit horizontally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/24/xbox-one-intended-to-sit-horizontally|title=Xbox One "Intended to Sit Horizontally"|first=Andrew|last=Goldfarb|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 24, 2013|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xbox One S utilizes a refreshed version of this design, with a case that is 40% smaller in size and supports vertical orientation with a stand. The main Xbox One S SKU is colored in an entirely matte "Robot White" finish, with half of the console adorned with machined holes, and a visible circular vent on top of the console's right half. It utilizes push-button controls rather than capacitive keys,&lt;ref name="techradar-onesreview"/&gt; the side USB port and controller sync button were moved to the front of the console, and its power supply is integrated into the console's casing rather than sitting externally (plugging directly into an outlet rather than using an external "brick").&lt;ref name="plint-onesdiff"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pocket-lint.com/games/buyers-guides/xbox/138002-xbox-one-s-vs-xbox-one-what-s-the-difference|title=Xbox One S vs Xbox One: What's the difference?|date=2016-11-10|work=Pocket-lint|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/2/12348212/microsoft-xbox-one-s-review|title=Xbox One S review: Great console, bad timing|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Xbox One supports [[1080p]] and [[720p]] video output; unlike the Xbox 360, the Xbox One does not support [[1080i]] and other [[interlaced]] resolutions.

The console can monitor its internal temperature and adjust accordingly to prevent [[Thermal shock|overheating]]; alongside increasing fan speed, additional measures can be taken, including forcing the hardware to run in a lower power state—a feature that was not present on Xbox 360.

In May 2018, Microsoft announced the [[Xbox Adaptive Controller]]—a special controller designed for [[Assistive technology|users with disabilities]]. It features two large dome-like buttons, and a series of connectors corresponding to standard Xbox controller buttons—which are used to attach specific types of buttons and other assertive peripherals.

Prior to and after the mandate, all Xbox One consoles initially shipped with the Kinect sensor included.

As with Xbox 360, premium online features such as multiplayer, voice communication, broadcasting and Upload Studio require an [[Xbox Live Gold]] subscription to use.

===Second screen and streaming===
The [[Xbox SmartGlass]] [[mobile app|app]] provides extended functionality on Xbox One, allowing devices running [[Windows Phone]], [[Windows 8]], [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] to be used as a companion device for Xbox One features, such as powering on the console, a [[remote control]], accessing messages and the Activity Feed, purchasing content, and providing integration with certain games and content.&lt;ref name=geek-onesmartglass&gt;{{cite web|title=E3 2013: How the Xbox One will use SmartGlass|url=http://www.geek.com/games/e3-2013-how-the-xbox-one-will-use-smartglass-1558263/|first=James|last=Plafke|work=[[Geek.com]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=June 10, 2013|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ndtv-sep14update&gt;{{cite web|title=Xbox One 'August' Update Roll-Out Begins; Brings New Activity Feed and More|url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/news/xbox-one-august-update-roll-out-begins-brings-new-activity-feed-and-more-577721|first=Robin|last=Sinha|work=[[NDTV]]|date=August 18, 2014|accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eg-poweron&gt;{{cite web|title=Xbox One update will let you turn on the console with your phone|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-04-22-xbox-one-update-lets-you-power-on-the-console-with-your-phone|first=Jeffrey|last=Matulef|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|date=April 22, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SmartGlass app can also be used to stream live television to Android and Windows devices if the console is using a USB digital television tuner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2014/08/12/xbox-one-updates-add-tv-streaming-smartglass-apps-new-media-player-app/|title=Xbox One to Get TV Streaming for SmartGlass Apps|first=Nick|last=Summers|work=The Next Web|date=August 12, 2014|accessdate=November 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Xbox Game Pass ===
{{Main|Xbox Game Pass}}

'''Xbox Game Pass''' is a [[subscription service]] from [[Microsoft]] for use with its Xbox One and [[Windows 10]]. Described as "[[Netflix]] for video games",&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2017/02/28/microsoft-takes-aim-at-playstation-now-with-netflix-like-xbox-game-pass/#434202c73d9e|title=Microsoft Takes Aim At PlayStation Now With Netflix-Like Xbox Game Pass|author=Paul Tassi|publisher=Forbes|date=February 28, 2017|accessdate=February 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Xbox Game Pass grants users access to a catalog of games from a range of publishers for a single monthly subscription price. The service was launched on June 1, 2017.

At its launch, the Xbox One did not have native [[backward compatibility]] with original [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] or [[Xbox 360]] games, and at the time Microsoft stated it had no plans for any form of backward compatibility on the console.&lt;ref name = "Verge Backwards Compat."&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/21/4350662/new-xbox-has-no-backwards-compatibilty|title=Xbox One will not be backwards compatible with Xbox 360 games|last=Hollister|first=Sean|work=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=May 21, 2013|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/05/21/xbox-one-not-backwards-compatible | title = Xbox One not backwards compatible | work= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]| date = May 21, 2013 | accessdate = June 5, 2013 | first = Drake | last = Audrey }}&lt;/ref&gt; Don Mattrick, head of the company's Interactive Entertainment Business at the time, said in an interview that he didn't see backwards compatibility as a problem and stated that "If you're backwards compatible, you're backwards". According to Mattrick, investing in backward compatibility wasn't worth the company's time and resources, as only 5% of Microsoft's customers played older games on new video game consoles.&lt;ref name="wsj-2013-bwcompat"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sherr |first1=Ian |title=Microsoft and Sony Diverge on Gaming ‘Cloud’ |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/05/22/microsoft-and-sony-diverge-on-gaming-cloud/ |website=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=6 March 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619014153/http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/05/22/microsoft-and-sony-diverge-on-gaming-cloud/ |archivedate=19 June 2013 |date=22 May 2013 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, backward compatibility had been a planned launch feature by Microsoft and had been actively under development as early as 2007 under the "Trioxide" program as to get Xbox 360 code to run on 64-bit hardware.&lt;ref name="ign bc history"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/23/the-untold-story-of-xbox-one-backwards-compatibility | title = The Untold Story of Xbox One Backwards Compatibility | first = Ryan | last = McCafferty | date= October 23, 2017 | accessdate = October 23, 2017 | work = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than going the route of the initial [[PlayStation 3]] which included a core [[PlayStation 2]] [[system-on-a-chip]] processor, the Xbox One hardware was designed to include support for Xbox 360 [[Windows Media Audio|XMA]] and texture processing in hardware, knowing this would be computationally expensive and inefficient to replicate in software.&lt;ref name="ign bc history"/&gt; Following criticism of its plan for an "always on" console from the May 2013 announcement, Microsoft had to put significant effort to prepare the Xbox One software for a revised approach, and the backwards compatibility development work were put on hold.&lt;ref name="ign bc history"/&gt; Interim solutions were suggested: senior project management and planning director Albert Penello explained that Microsoft was initially considering a [[cloud gaming]] platform to enable backward compatibility, but he felt it would be "problematic" due to varying internet connection qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-talks-digital-only-future-kinect-and-why-xbox-one-is-worth-100-more-than-playstation-4/1100-6413920/|title=Microsoft Talks Digital-Only Future, Kinect, and Why Xbox One is Worth $100 More Than PlayStation 4|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=September 3, 2013 |accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Karmali|first=Luke|title=Xbox One Backwards Compatibility Through Cloud 'Problematic'|url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/11/08/xbox-one-backwards-compatibility-through-cloud-problematic|work=[[IGN]]|date=November 8, 2013|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xbox Live]] director of programming [[Larry Hryb|Larry "Major Nelson" Hryb]] did state that users could theoretically use the HDMI-in port on the console to pass an Xbox 360 (or, alternatively, any other device that supports HDMI output, including competing consoles)&lt;ref name=extech-hdmiin&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft confirms that PS4, Wii U will work with Xbox One HDMI passthrough|url=http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/170667-microsoft-confirms-that-ps4-wii-u-will-work-with-xbox-one-hdmi-passthrough|first=Grant|last=Brunner|work=[[ExtremeTech]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=November 8, 2013|accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the Xbox One.&lt;ref name="Xbox compatibility" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oxm.co.uk/61886/features/the-xbox-one-33-things-you-need-to-know/?page=2 | title = The Xbox One 33 things you need to know | work = [[Official Xbox Magazine]] | publisher = [[Future plc]] | date =  | accessdate = June 5, 2013 | first = Jon | last = Hicks | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130913062222/http://www.oxm.co.uk/61886/features/the-xbox-one-33-things-you-need-to-know/?page=1 | archivedate = September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process does generate a small amount of unnoticeable [[display lag]].&lt;ref name=extech-hdmiin/&gt;

Following the release of the Xbox One and transition of Phil Spencer to the head of the Xbox division in 2014, he and software engineering vice president Kareem Choudhry restarted the backwards compatibility program in relative secret within the company. Choudhry brought on previous engineers that worked on Trioxide, including Kevin La Chapelle, Jonathan Morrison, and Barry Bond, to restart the program. The team chose to start with ''[[Castle Crashers]]'', which included Xbox networking features, to test backwards compatibility.&lt;ref name="ign bc history"/&gt; ''Castle Crashers'' frequently crashed to a screen with alphanumeric codes, which La Chapelle was able to obtain from the game's developers, [[The Behemoth]], which helped them to rapidly diagnose problems and fix the compatibility issues.&lt;ref name="ign bc history"/&gt; Solving most of the major problems through ''Castle Crashers'', the background compatibility team decided to let the program be announced at [[E3 2015]] with plans to have one hundred titles available by the end of 2015.&lt;ref name="ign bc history"/&gt; However, by E3, they still found problems with some games running at extremely low framerates. During the event, Morrison recognized that a fundamental difference between the Xbox 360 and Xbox One was its [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] rate, and when they returned, Morrison's idea helped them to rapidly complete work to meet its promised goal by the end of that year.&lt;ref name="ign bc history"/&gt; Individual games still brought some difficulty, specifically ''[[Halo: Reach]]'', but this prompted the team to develop automatic tools that could be used to identify where Xbox 360 titles would be difficult to run as-is on the Xbox One and how to work around those; this further set up the potential to improve Xbox 360 games on the future iterations of the Xbox One, such as the Xbox One X to improve graphics support.&lt;ref name="ign bc history"/&gt;

Xbox 360 backward compatibility uses "Fission", a software [[Video game console emulator|emulator]] within the system software; 104 Xbox 360 titles were supported at the feature's public launch, with more added in the following months.&lt;ref name=XOBackwardsCompatibility&gt;{{cite news|last=Dornbush|first=Jonathon|title=Play your old Xbox 360 games on Xbox One starting this holiday|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/06/15/xbox-one-backwards-compatible-xbox-360-e3|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=June 19, 2015|date=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xbox 360 games contained within ''[[Rare Replay]]'' are packaged as standalone applications using the Xbox 360 emulation.&lt;ref name=polygon-rarereplayreview&gt;{{cite web|title=Rare Replay review: in times past|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/8/3/9085379/rare-replay-review-xbox-one-banjo-kazooie-perfect-dark-battletoads-killer-instinct-blast-corps|first=Philip|last=Kollar|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=August 3, 2015|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft stated that publishers would only need to provide permission to the company to allow the repackaging, and it expected the number of supported games to increase significantly over time.&lt;ref name=verge-onebackwards&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft is bringing Xbox 360 games to the Xbox One|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/15/8783143/microsoft-is-bringing-xbox-360-games-to-the-xbox-one|first=Tom|last=Warren|website=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate=June 15, 2015|date=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-xb1xb360&gt;{{cite web|title=Xbox 360 backward compatibility coming to Xbox One|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/xbox-360-backwards-compatibility-coming-to-xbox-one/|first=Sam|last=Machkovech|work=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|accessdate=June 15, 2015|date=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-bwcompatibility&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft built an Xbox 360 emulator to make games run on the Xbox One|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/15/8785955/microsoft-xbox-one-xbox-360-emulator-software|first=Tom|last=Warren|website=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate=June 15, 2015|date=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft, along with fourteen other third-party publishers, will offer supported games, and all [[Games with Gold]] titles on Xbox 360 since November 2015 are made compatible.&lt;ref name="GamesRadar-xb1xb360"/&gt;&lt;ref name=polygon-gwgxb360/&gt;

====Original Xbox compatibility====
[[File:Xbox-console.jpg|thumb|The first Xbox videogame revealed to be compatible with the Xbox One was ''[[Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge]]''.|alt=The Xbox console with a Controller S]]
Xbox division head [[Phil Spencer (business executive)|Phil Spencer]] had also hinted the possibility of adding support for games from the original Xbox.&lt;ref name="Original Xbox Games"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Makuch|first1=Eddie|title=Xbox One Backwards Compatibility Could One Day Work With Original Xbox Games|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-one-backwards-compatibility-could-one-day-wor/1100-6429894/|website=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=August 19, 2015|accessdate=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the backwards compatibility team, after they completed the framework for Xbox 360 compatibility so that other engineering teams could take over, they turned to the question of compatibility with the original Xbox console. The program was started in November 2016, under the code name "Fusion", and was led by software engineer Spencer Perreault.&lt;ref name="ign bc history"/&gt; Perreault initially tried the same approaches as the team had done with "Fission", but due to the differences in memory management sizes and chipset bit-rates, these initial tests failed. Instead, Perreault worked to bring "Dolphin", a developer tool for the original Xbox, working to get its emulation correct. La Chapelle brought in a number of personal Xbox titles to test in Perreault's emulation, getting about a 10% "hit rate" on successes, though the variety of failures helped Perreault to identify common problems, and within a month, had improved the successful hit rate to about 90%.&lt;ref name="ign bc history"/&gt; As with Xbox 360 backwards compatibility, the Fusion emulation enables Xbox games to be scaled to 1080p resolutions, work with Xbox One networking features, and can allow mixed-console System Link connection between all three generations of Xbox.&lt;ref name="ign bc history"/&gt;

With Perreault's success, Microsoft announced the Xbox backwards compatibility on the Xbox One in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/xbox-one-will-get-compatibility-with-original-xbox-game-1796002721 |title=Xbox One Will Get Compatibility With Original Xbox Games |last=Kohler |first=Chris |date=June 11, 2017 |website=[[Kotaku]] |access-date=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen titles were initially released on October 24, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/23/16520304/original-xbox-backwards-compatibility-xbox-one-release-date | title = Original Xbox compatibility, and 13 games, arriving on Xbox One tomorrow | first = Christopher | last=  Grant | date = October 23, 2017 | accessdate = October 23, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft announced an additional 19 titles to be added to the Xbox One service during April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/10/morrowind-kotor-2-jade-empire-headline-new-wave-of-original-xbox-backwards-compatible-games | title = Morrowind, Kotor 2, Jade Empire Headline New Wave Of Original Xbox Backwards Compatible Games | first = Brandin |last= Tyrrel | date = April 10, 2018 | accessdate = April 10, 2018 | work = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft does not anticipate that there will be as many Xbox titles brought to the program as with the Xbox 360, primarily due to legal issues related to [[intellectual property]], contracts, and companies that have since gone defunct.&lt;ref name="ign bc history"/&gt;

==Reception==

===Pre-release===
While the initial unveiling of the Xbox One in May 2013 created criticism that led to significant changes in the digital rights management scheme it would use, other features of the console were highlighted by journalists. The editorial staff of ''Game Informer'' offered both praise and criticism for the console. Matt Helgeson described the console as Microsoft's intent to "control the living room". He called Xbox One's instant switching features "impressive", and that the console was "a step in the right direction" with regards to TV entertainment, especially the prospect of avoiding the usage of non-intuitive user interfaces often found on cable [[set-top box]]es. Jeff Cork said that Microsoft had "some great ideas" for the console, but that it failed to properly communicate them.&lt;ref name="GI-Reveal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2013/05/22/game-informer-editors-react-to-xbox-one-news.aspx|title=Game Informer Editors React To Xbox One News|first=Matt|last=Bertz|work=[[GameInformer]]|publisher=GameStop|date=May 22, 2013|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft's E3 2013 press conference was criticized for focusing too much on games that, beyond increased graphical capabilities, provided experiences that were otherwise similar to previous-generation games—giving little incentive for buying the new console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walton|first=Mark|title=The Uninspired Lineup of Xbox One|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-uninspired-lineup-of-xbox-one/1100-6409579/|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=December 13, 2016|date=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McShea|first=Tom|title=Xbox One: New Console, Old Games|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-one-new-console-old-games/1100-6409577/|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=December 13, 2016|date=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rafi Mohammed, author of "The Art of Pricing", felt that Microsoft priced Xbox One "too high" and that the $100 premium over its competitor could "derail" the system during the 2013 holiday season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mohammed|first=Rafi|title=Did Microsoft Overshoot on Xbox One Pricing? |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/video/did-microsoft-overshoot-on-xbox-one-pricing-4~~kjSH9TReVJAd9tivMpA.html|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=June 23, 2013|date=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|title=Xbox One pricing "too high" says business author|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-one-pricing-too-high-says-business-author/1100-6410607/|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=December 13, 2016|date=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
Upon its release, the Xbox One received favorable reviews from critics and reviewers. In its launch review, ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' gave the Xbox One an 8/10. Its design was described as "inoffensive" but its larger size noted, while the console's quieter and cooler operation was praised for indicating a potentially higher reliability than Xbox 360 was on-launch. The controller was praised for its battery life and "premium" design, but some members of the site's staff felt that its shoulder buttons were stiffer than that of previous designs. The design of Xbox One's interface received mixed reviews: noting that it carried over [[Windows 8]]'s [[Metro design language|design language]], the interface was disfavored for hiding functions under the controller's menu button and for being awkward to use with a controller or motion gestures, seemingly encouraging users to use voice navigation instead. While praised for having more "robust" voice navigation than Xbox 360, they felt that voice navigation still had a "[[learning curve]] in understanding what works and what doesn't." Although its user following, Smart Match, and improved voice chat features were noted, Xbox Live was panned for not offering the option on-launch to add a real name to user profiles. Despite a regression in local and network multimedia functionality in comparison to Xbox 360 and how OneGuide interacted with outside set-top boxes (drawing comparisons to the operations of [[TiVo]] DVRs), ''Polygon'' felt the Xbox One's overall multimedia experience "feels like a major step forward in set-top boxes and makes the Xbox One the obvious center of any living room that has one."&lt;ref name=polygon-xb1review&gt;{{cite web|title=The Xbox One Review|url=http://www.polygon.com/a/xbox-one-review|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben Gilbert of ''[[Engadget]]'' was similarly modest upon its launch, assigning the console a score of 81/100 and describing the Xbox One's design as a "1993 artist's rendering of 2013's technology". Acknowledging that its controller was a mere refinement of the "ubiquit[ous]" Xbox 360 design, he praised the controller for its improved D-pad and quieter triggers but criticized its stiff shoulder buttons. Kinect received positive reviews for its face recognition login and improved motion tracking, but that whilst "magical", "every false positive or unrecognized [voice] command had us reaching for the controller." The overall interface was also considered more intuitive and flexible than that of PlayStation 4, but its game library view was described as being a "jumbled, sadly unfilterable rows of every owned piece of software", that also knowingly listed games that require their disc to run alongside those which did not. The console was also panned for missing certain promised features on-launch, such as Upload Studio, game streaming, and certain apps/services.&lt;ref name=engadget-2013review&gt;{{cite web|title=Xbox One review: a fast and powerful work in progress|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/11/20/microsoft-xbox-one-review/|first=Ben|last=Gilbert|work=[[Engadget]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=November 20, 2013|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, critics felt that the Xbox One's functionality had matured over the year following its launch; Jeff Bakalar of ''[[CNET]]'', assigning it a score of 8/10, acknowledged improvements to Xbox One's software since its original release, but that its user interface was still unintuitive in comparison to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 4, explaining that "navigating the interface seems to be much more problematic than it rightfully should be, and there's simply not enough transparency in the logic within it. There are oddities peppered throughout, which is the root for countless headaches and frustrations." Xbox One's in-game performance was mixed, with some titles showing slower performance over PS4, but some multi-platform games performing better on Xbox One than PS4. CNET praised the wider lineup of multimedia services and apps on Xbox One over PS4, not requiring Xbox Live Gold for online save data storage, support for high-speed [[USB 3.0]] as secondary storage, and having a "slightly better" lineup of upcoming exclusives, concluding that "While the PS4 had a clear advantage at launch, that edge is slowly evaporating as Microsoft has worked feverishly to undo most of the Xbox One's original missteps."&lt;ref name=cnet-nov14review&gt;{{cite web|title=Slow and steady, the Xbox One gradually improves|url=https://www.cnet.com/products/microsoft-xbox-one/|first=Jeff|last=Bakalar|website=[[CNET]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=November 16, 2015|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nick Pino of ''[[TechRadar]]'', giving it four stars out of five, similarly felt that the Xbox One "[felt] more like a media titan today than it did 12 months ago," citing OneGuide, Upload Studio, and Microsoft's decision to drop the Xbox Live Gold requirement for multimedia streaming apps, and that "there's still a lot of potential locked away inside the hardware of the system that developers are just beginning to figure out. So while PlayStation might have the upper hand for now when it comes to certain third-party titles, it may not always remain that way. Just how Microsoft will get it to that point, though, is still a mystery." However, he disfavored the console's dependence upon a subscription for most of its functionality, Kinect's voice recognition, and that some games do not natively run at [[1080p]] resolution, but are [[video scaler|upscaled]].&lt;ref name=techradar-xb1review /&gt; In an August 2016 review of the Xbox One S model, ''TechRadar'' further commended Microsoft's recent improvements to Xbox One, citing a strong lineup of first-party titles in 2015 and further improvements to the console's interface.&lt;ref name="techradar-onesreview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Xbox One S review|url=http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/gaming/games-consoles/xbox-one-s-1323399/review|first=Nick|last=Pino|website=[[TechRadar]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alaina Yee of [[IGN]] also praised how Xbox One had evolved since its launch, assigning it with Kinect a score of 8.1/10 and acknowledging that Microsoft had "made good on its promise of listening to consumers, rolling out a steady stream of updates that have both broadened and deepened what this third Xbox console offers." Regarding the console's slightly lower level of graphics capabilities in comparison to PlayStation 4, it was noted that "while videophiles might spot instances of upscaled graphics and less detailed environments immediately, most people generally won't notice a difference between Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions of a game (when there is one) unless they see both running side by side", and examples of "gorgeous" Xbox One games were noted, such as ''[[Sunset Overdrive]]'' and ''[[Forza Motorsport 5]]''. The number of "hidden" options in Xbox One's user interface was equated to "hunting for treasure in a messy room"; as such, Kinect voice commands, in combination with access to common functions within the [[Xbox SmartGlass]] app, were praised for helping to provide a more streamlined user experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/27/xbox-one-with-kinect-review|title=Xbox One with Kinect Review|first=Alaina|last=Yee|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=November 26, 2014|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Xbox One S revision was critically praised for its improvements over the original model, including its streamlined design, the addition of HDR and 4K video support, and visual improvements on some games (such as ''[[Fallout 4]]'' and ''[[Rise of the Tomb Raider]]'') when upscaled to 4K. However, ''[[TechRadar]]'' noted regressions such as the lack of a Kinect port (considered "one last kick in the pants for all the gamers forced into buying the more expensive console bundle two short years ago"), and concerns that the revised hardware and HDR support would lead to [[Fragmentation (programming)|fragmentation]] of Xbox One's ecosystem, as not all users will necessarily experience a game the same way.&lt;ref name="techradar-onesreview"/&gt;

Dieter Bohn of ''[[The Verge]]'' similarly felt that although it was one of the cheapest 4K Blu-ray players on the market,  consumers were more interested in streaming 4K content (which could be accomplished with cheaper [[digital media player]]s) than 4K Blu-ray discs, and noted the small number of HDR-enabled games on launch. Bohn concluded that the Xbox One S would appeal best to new owners or those who wish to leverage its HDR and 4K support, but recommended that existing owners consider [[Xbox One X]] instead.&lt;ref name="verge-onesreview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Xbox One S review|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/2/12348212/microsoft-xbox-one-s-review|first=Dieter|last=Bohn|website=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=August 2, 2016|accessdate=December 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-no4kbluray"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sony's new PlayStation 4 Pro can't play 4K Blu-rays|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/7/12839756/sony-ps4-no-4k-uhd-blu-ray|first=Chris|last=Welch|website=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=September 7, 2016|accessdate=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of exclusive titles ===
The Xbox One platform has faced criticism for lacking in [[Console exclusivity|exclusive releases]] over competitors such as PlayStation 4 and [[Nintendo Switch]]. Although there have been releases in flagship Microsoft franchises such as ''[[Forza (series)|Forza]]'' and ''[[Halo (franchise)|Halo]]'', they have underperformed in comparison to other entries, while several major Xbox One exclusives have faced notable delays, such as ''[[Crackdown 3]]'',  or outright cancellations, including ''[[Fable Legends]]'' and ''[[Scalebound]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/09/microsoft-confirms-scalebound-is-cancelled|title=Microsoft Confirms Scalebound is Cancelled|last=Goldfarb|first=Andrew|date=2017-01-09|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, PS4 and Switch have seen a large number of critically successful first- and third-party exclusives, and [[Activision]] would sign with [[Sony Interactive Entertainment]] for timed exclusivity on certain add-on content in the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' and ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'' franchises—the former having replaced a previous deal with Microsoft.&lt;ref name="verge-exclusives"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/22/15010540/video-game-exclusives-ps4-xbox-one-switch-zelda-horizon-scorpio-first-party|title=The Xbox One is struggling because video game exclusives still matter|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/28/xboxs-lack-of-compelling-games-wont-be-fixed-next-year/|title=Xbox's lack of compelling games won't be fixed next year|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analyst also noted that Microsoft's first-party studios were not as strong as those of Sony, explaining that "Sony has always been about first party and Microsoft wanted to emulate that, but they allowed studios like [[Rare (company)|Rare]] and [[Lionhead Studios|Lionhead]] to fade away."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/29/16930892/xbox-one-exclusive-games-analysis-microsoft|title=The Xbox One has a serious exclusive games problem|work=Polygon|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Microsoft acquired a large number of third-party studios, including [[Compulsion Games]], [[InXile Entertainment]], [[Ninja Theory]], [[Obsidian Entertainment]], [[Playground Games]], and [[Undead Labs]], and hired former [[Crystal Dynamics]] head Darrell Gallagher to lead a new Microsoft studio known as The Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17446914/microsoft-studios-the-initiative-undead-labs-playground-games-ninja-theory-compulsion-games-xbox-e3|title=Microsoft announces big, multistudio push to create more Xbox exclusives|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/10/18082922/microsoft-xbox-inxile-obsidian-entertainment-studio-acquisition|title=Microsoft's Xbox exclusives push continues with new studio acquisitions|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=2018-11-10|website=The Verge|access-date=2018-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Microsoft began to make future Xbox One-exclusive first-party releases simultaneously available on [[Windows 10]] PCs, with digital cross-buy support via [[Microsoft Store (digital)|Microsoft Store]] under the branding [[Xbox Play Anywhere]]. This, thus, makes the games Microsoft platform exclusives rather than Xbox One exclusives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-xbox-one-merge-new-games-windows-pcs/|title=You won't need an Xbox to play Microsoft's next generation of games|date=2016-03-01|work=CNET|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/7/1/12077802/xbox-play-anywhere-launches-sept-13|title=Xbox Play Anywhere launches Sept. 13|last=Crecente|first=Brian|date=July 1, 2016|website=Polygon|access-date=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft has used the branding "console launch exclusive" to refer to titles (such as ''[[PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds]]'') that are timed or permanent exclusives to Xbox console hardware, but were already available on, or are planned to be available on PC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2017-xbox-boss-clarifies-what-console-launch-ex/1100-6450919/|title=E3 2017: Xbox Boss Clarifies What "Console Launch Exclusive" Means|last=Newhouse|first=Alex|date=2017-06-13|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft initially imposed policies referred to as the "parity clause" on [[indie game]]s, which required that the Xbox One version of a game be released at the same time as versions on other platforms. Phil Spencer stated that this rule was intended to ensure that Xbox One was a "first-class" platform by discouraging staggered releases. However, these policies resulted in some studios, such as [[Vlambeer]] (developer of ''[[Nuclear Throne]]'') choosing to negotiate console exclusivity with Sony instead, who proved to be more receptive to indie development. By July 2015, Microsoft had changed its policies in response to the criticism, with Spencer admitting that this policy was onerous on smaller studios. Spencer also stated that Microsoft was willing to work with studios to help make the Xbox launches of former timed exclusives "special in some way", so that customers are not simply purchasing "last year's game".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-ones-launch-parity-clause-is-pretty-much-over/1100-6429261/|title=Xbox One's Launch Parity Clause Is Pretty Much Over, Exec Says|last=Newhouse|first=Alex|date=2015-07-28|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-ones-parity-clause-meant-to-make-owners-feel-/1100-6422886/|title=Xbox One's Parity Clause Meant to Make Owners Feel "First Class"|last=Pereira|first=Chris|date=2014-10-10|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sales===
Microsoft only publicized its sales figures during the first year after release.

===Xbox All-Access===
In August 2018, Microsoft announced that it would, for a limited time, offer a financing program known as '''Xbox All Access''' through [[Microsoft Store]] in the United States. The program will allow users to purchase an Xbox One S or X console, bundled with subscriptions to both Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Game Pass, financed over a two-year contract. The customer retains ownership of the console after the two years, and if they break contract prior to that, they must pay the difference on the remaining console cost. The pricing is set to be cheaper overall than purchasing the individual elements alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/8/27/17786696/xbox-all-access-price-deal-microsoft|title=Microsoft's All Access subscription really is a good deal if you want an Xbox|work=Polygon|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/xbox-all-access-confirmed-1202917439/ | title = Microsoft Launching Xbox All-Access Financing Program | first= Stefanie | last= Fogel | date = August 27, 2018 | accessdate = August 27, 2018 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Xbox One S All-Digital Edition===
On April 16, 2019, Microsoft unveiled an "all-digital" configuration of the Xbox One S named '''Xbox One S All-Digital Edition''', which excludes the Blu-ray Disc drive.

[[File:XBOX ONE X Gamescom (36042607743).jpg|thumb|An Xbox One X]]
Microsoft first teased the '''Xbox One X''', a high-end hardware revision of the Xbox One, at E3 2016 under the codename "Project Scorpio", and released it on November 7, 2017 with a 1&amp;nbsp;[[Terabyte|TB]] model priced at US$499,&lt;ref name="verge-onexunveil"&gt;{{cite web|title= Xbox One X is Microsoft's next game console, arriving on November 7th for $499|url= https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/11/15774918/microsoft-xbox-one-x-release-date-price-new-console-announced-e3-2017|first= Tom|last= Warren|website= [[The Verge]]|publisher= [[Vox Media]]|date= June 11, 2017|accessdate= June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a limited, pre-order exclusive "Project Scorpio Edition", with a dark-gradient finish, vertical stand-brace and green "Project Scorpio" inscriptions on the console and bundled controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/20/16160650/microsoft-xbox-one-x-project-scorpio-edition-preorders|first= Tom|last= Warren|title= Microsoft's Project Scorpio returns as a special Xbox One X for preorders|work= [[The Verge]]|publisher= [[Vox Media]]|date= August 20, 2017|accessdate= November 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/8/16624364/xbox-one-x-project-scorpio-edition-numbers-0105101317|title= What do the numbers on the Xbox One X Project Scorpio Edition box mean?|last= Sarkar|first= Samit|date= November 8, 2017|website= [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher= [[Vox Media]]|accessdate= November 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Xbox One S, the Xbox One X also includes a UHD Blu-ray player.

The Xbox One X features upgraded hardware, designed primarily to render games at [[4K resolution]] and to provide performance improvements for existing games;&lt;ref name="verge-onexunveil"/&gt; they can be displayed at full resolution on 4K displays, or [[supersampling|supersampled]] for lower-resolution displays.&lt;ref name="verge-onexunveil"/&gt; It uses a [[system-on-chip]] (SoC) known as ''Scorpio Engine'', which incorporates a 2.3&amp;nbsp;GHz octa-core CPU, and a Radeon GPU with 40 [[Shader processing units|Compute Units]] clocked at 1172&amp;nbsp;MHz, generating 6 [[teraflops]] of graphical computing performance. It also includes 12&amp;nbsp;GB of [[GDDR5]] RAM with 9&amp;nbsp;GB allocated to games.&lt;ref name="engadget-moreram"&gt;{{cite web|title= Xbox exec reveals Scorpio has 9GB of RAM available for games|url= https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/09/xbox-one-project-scorpio-memory/|first= Richard|last= Lawler|website= [[Engadget]]|publisher= [[AOL]]|date= June 9, 2017|accessdate= June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scorpio Engine's CPU utilizes a custom platform designed to maintain compatibility with the Jaguar CPU of the original Xbox One, but with a 31% increase in performance; the custom platform is unrelated to AMD's current [[Ryzen]] architecture. The console uses a [[vapor chamber|vapor-chamber]] method of cooling for the SoC, and motherboards tailored to the exact voltage needs of each individual Scorpio SoC to optimize their output and energy usage.&lt;ref name="eg-scorpiotech"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2017-project-scorpio-tech-revealed|title= Inside the next Xbox: Project Scorpio tech revealed|first= Richard|last= Leadbetter|date= April 6, 2017|accessdate= April 6, 2017|work= [[Eurogamer]]|publisher= Gamer Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; The console also supports AMD's [[FreeSync]] technology, 1440p resolution, and/or 120&amp;nbsp;Hz refresh rate on compatible displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/xbox-one-x-scorpio-games-explainer-video/|title= Xbox One X: Everything you need to know|first= Mark|last= Walton|work= [[Ars Technica]]|publisher= [[Condé Nast]]|date= June 12, 2017|accessdate= August 4, 2017|language= en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.blurbusters.com/xbox-consoles-now-support-120hz/|title= XBox Consoles Now Support 120Hz|first= Mark|last= Rejhon|work= Blur Busters|date= April 21, 2018|accessdate= April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Xbox One X is compatible with all existing Xbox One software and accessories.&lt;ref name="verge-scorpio"/&gt; To assist in optimizing the new hardware to run existing games at 4K resolution, Microsoft developers used internal debugging software to collect [[Trace-based simulation|GPU traces]] from major titles that did not run at full 1080p resolution on the original Xbox One.&lt;ref name="eg-scorpiotech"/&gt; ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'', which uses a scaling system that dynamically lowers the game's resolution when needed to maintain a consistent frame rate,&lt;ref name="ars-halo5scaling"&gt;{{cite web|title= How dynamic resolution scaling keeps Halo 5 running so smoothly|url= https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/how-dynamic-resolution-scaling-keeps-halo-5-running-so-smoothly/|first= Kyle|last= Orland|website= [[Ars Technica]]|publisher= [[Condé Nast]]|date= October 28, 2015|accessdate= June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was able to run at its native resolution with no scaling on Xbox One X hardware.&lt;ref name="verge-scorpio"&gt;{{cite web|title= Project Scorpio is a 4K-capable, VR-ready Xbox One launching next fall|url= https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11890842/microsoft-xbox-project-scorpio-virtual-reality-e3-2016|first= Andrew|last= Webster|website= [[The Verge]]|publisher= [[Vox Media]]|date= June 13, 2016|accessdate= June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phil Spencer touted that Xbox One X's hardware could also support [[virtual reality]], due to its power, price point, and convenience.&lt;ref name="verge-scorpio"/&gt; At the 2017 [[Game Developers Conference]], Microsoft announced plans to support [[Windows Mixed Reality]] VR headsets on Xbox One in 2018, but the company later stated that it was initially focusing on PC platforms first, and that it wanted to focus on wireless VR solutions for consoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Paul|first1= Ian|title= Windows 'Mixed Reality' VR headsets will hit the Xbox One and Project Scorpio next year|url= http://www.pcworld.com/article/3176515/virtual-reality/windows-mixed-reality-vr-headsets-will-hit-the-xbox-one-and-project-scorpio-next-year.html|website= [[PCWorld]]|publisher= [[IDG]]|date= March 2, 2017|accessdate= April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon-novryet"&gt;{{cite web|title= Don't expect Xbox VR to be at E3 this year, or in stores this holiday|url= https://www.polygon.com/2017/6/6/15745630/xbox-vr-e3|author= [[Brian Crecente|Crecente, Brian]]|website= [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|publisher= [[Vox Media]]|date= June 6, 2017|accessdate= June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Games marketed by Microsoft as ''[[List of Xbox One X Enhanced games|Xbox One X Enhanced]]'' have specific optimizations for graphical fidelity on the console's hardware.

The Xbox One X has been characterized as a competitor to the [[PlayStation 4 Pro]], a hardware update of the PlayStation 4 released in late 2016 that similarly focuses on 4K gaming and improved [[PlayStation VR|virtual reality]] performance, although Phil Spencer relegated the PlayStation 4 Pro as competition to the Xbox One S instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Warren|first1= Tom|title= Xbox's Phil Spencer: PS4 Pro is an Xbox One S competitor, not a true 4K console|url= https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15790162/microsoft-phil-spencer-xbox-one-x-vs-ps4-pro-interview|website= [[The Verge]]|publisher= [[Vox Media]]|date= June 13, 2017|accessdate= June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016 Penello stated that the performance advantage of the Xbox One X over the PS4 Pro would be "obvious", noting that the PS4 Pro's GPU only had 4.2 teraflops of graphical computing performance in comparison to Microsoft's stated 6 teraflops.&lt;ref name="verge-sonymspcs"&gt;{{cite web|title= First Click: Are Sony and Microsoft's new consoles PC gone mad?|url= https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/16/11952320/first-click-ps4-neo-xbox-scorpio-e3-2016|first= Sam|last= Byford|website= [[The Verge]]|publisher= [[Vox Media]]|date= June 16, 2016|accessdate= June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot-vsps4pro"&gt;{{cite web|title= Xbox Scorpio vs. PS4 Pro -- Microsoft Discusses Its Big Power Advantage|url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-scorpio-vs-ps4-pro-microsoft-discusses-its-bi/1100-6443399/|first= Eddie|last= Makuch|work= [[GameSpot]]|publisher= [[CBS Interactive]]|date= October 10, 2016|accessdate= October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some journalists thought that Microsoft's messaging and positioning of Scorpio alongside the release of the Xbox One S were at odds with themselves and "confusing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2016/06/14/xbox-one-s-vs-project-scorpio/ | title = It's never been harder to buy an Xbox One | first = Aaron | last = Souppouris | date = June 14, 2016 | accessdate = June 14, 2016 | work = [[Engadget]]|publisher=[[AOL]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/4k-won-t-be-mandatory-for-xbox-scorpio-games/0168588 | title = 4K won't be mandatory for Xbox Scorpio games | first = Ben | last = Parfitt | date = June 15, 2016 | accessdate = June 15, 2016 | work = [[MCV (magazine)|MCV]]|publisher= [[NewBay Media]]}}
