The '''iPhone 4''' is a [[smartphone]] that was designed and marketed by [[Apple Inc.]] It is the [[List of iOS devices|fourth]] generation of the [[iPhone]] lineup, succeeding the [[iPhone 3GS]] and preceding the [[iPhone 4S|4S]]. Following a number of notable leaks, the iPhone 4 was first unveiled on June 7, 2010, at Apple's [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|Worldwide Developers Conference]] in [[San Francisco]],&lt;ref name="Live WWDC 2010 – Engadget"&gt;{{cite web|last=Topolsky|first=Joshua|title=Steve Jobs live from WWDC 2010|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/06/07/steve-jobs-live-from-wwdc-2010|publisher=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=18 June 2010|date=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released on June 24, 2010, in the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Germany]], and [[Japan]]. The iPhone 4 introduced a new hardware design to the iPhone family, which Apple's [[CEO]] [[Steve Jobs]] touted as the thinnest smartphone in the world at the time; it consisted of a stainless steel frame which doubled as an antenna, with internal components situated between two panels of [[aluminosilicate]] glass.&lt;ref name = "Definitive Guide"/&gt; The iPhone 4 also introduced Apple's new high-resolution "[[Retina Display]]" (with a [[pixel density]] of 326 [[pixels per inch]]), while maintaining the same physical size and aspect ratio as its precursors. The iPhone 4 also introduced Apple's [[Apple A4|A4]] [[system-on-chip]], along with [[iOS 4]]—which notably introduced multitasking functionality and Apple's new [[FaceTime]] [[Videotelephony|video chat]] service. The iPhone 4 was also the first iPhone to include a [[front-facing camera]], and the first to be released in a version for [[CDMA]] networks, ending [[AT&amp;T Mobility|AT&amp;T]]'s period as the exclusive carrier of iPhone products in the United States.

The iPhone 4 received largely positive reception, with critics praising its revamped design and more powerful hardware, in comparison to previous models. While it was a market success (with over 600,000 pre-orders within 24 hours), the release of the iPhone 4 was plagued by highly publicized reports concerning abnormalities in its new antenna design that caused the device to lose its cellular signal if held in a certain way. Most human contact with the phone's outer edge would cause a significant decrease in signal strength. Apple released [[iOS 4#4.0.1|iOS 4.0.1]] to unsuccessfully try and fix these issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Apple releases iOS 4.0.1 with new iPhone signal formula|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1152733/iOS4_0_1.html|last=|first=|date=July 15, 2010|website=Macworld|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=May 19, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iPhone 4 spent the longest time as Apple's flagship iPhone model at fifteen months. Although the succeeding 4S was announced in October 2011, the 4 continued to be sold as a midrange model until September 2012, and thereafter as the entry-level offering in Apple's lineup until September 2013 with the announcement of the [[iPhone 5S]]/[[iPhone 5C]]. The iPhone 4 had the longest lifespan of any [[iPhone]] ever produced, spanning close to four years and available in some [[developing countries]] until early 2015.

Before the official unveiling of the iPhone 4 on June 7, 2010, two [[prototype]]s were brought to the attention of the media, breaching Apple's normally secretive development process. Many of the speculations regarding technical specifications proved accurate.

====Engadget leak====
On January 27, 2010, gadget website [[Engadget]] received leaked images of the unreleased [[iPad (1st generation)|first-generation iPad]].&lt;ref name="engadget leak 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Patel|first=Nilay|title=Is this the Apple tablet?|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/01/27/is-this-the-apple-tablet/|publisher=[[Engadget]]|work=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=March 20, 2016|date=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unbeknownst to the editors and readers, these images contained two unreleased iPhone 4 models.&lt;ref name="engadget leak 2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Patel|first=Nilay|title=iPhone-iTablet Size Comparison|url=http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2010/01/iphone-itablet-size-comparison-600.jpg|publisher=[[Engadget]]|work=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=March 20, 2016|date=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until the subsequent [[Gizmodo]] release that they were aware of the complete contents of the images.&lt;ref name="engadget leak 3"&gt;{{cite web|last=Topolsky|first=Joshua|title=iPhone 4G: proof|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/04/18/iphone-4g-proof/|publisher=[[Engadget]]|work=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=March 20, 2016|date=April 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gizmodo leak====
On April 19, 2010, gadget website [[Gizmodo]] reported that they had purchased an iPhone prototype for $5000, and furthermore, had conducted a [[product teardown]] of the device. The prototype was reported to have been lost by an Apple employee, Gray Powell, in [[Redwood City, California]].&lt;ref name="gizmodo leak 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Golijan|first=Rosa|title=The Tale of Apple's Next iPhone|url=https://gizmodo.com/5520471/the-tale-of-apples-next-iphone|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|work=[[Gizmodo]]|accessdate=June 18, 2010|date=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Gizmodo published detailed information about the prototype, Apple's legal associates formally requested for the phone to be returned to Apple, and Gizmodo responded with the intent to cooperate.&lt;ref name="gizmodo leak 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/5520479/a-letter-apple-wants-its-secret-iphone-back|title=A Letter: Apple Wants Its Secret iPhone Back|first=Brian|last=Lam|date= April 19, 2010|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|work=[[Gizmodo]]|accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 23, officers from the Rapid Enforcement Allied Computer Team (REACT) task force of the California [[High Technology Theft Apprehension and Prosecution Program|HTTAP Program]] raided the home of Jason Chen, the Gizmodo editor responsible for reviewing the prototype, seizing all of his computers and hard drives.&lt;ref name="cnet gizmodo reaction 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-20003446-37.html|title=Police seize Gizmodo's computers in iPhone probe|author1=Sandoval, Greg |author2=McCullagh, Declan |date=April 26, 2010|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|work=[[Gizmodo]]|accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] criticized the raid as violating journalist source protection laws that forbid the seizure of journalist computers, as well as the suspicion that Apple had used its influence as a member of the steering committee, which is charged with direction and oversight of California, REACT task force to push police into action in a way that would not normally be conducted for this type of incident. Apple had already received the iPhone prototype before the raid when it was returned by Gizmodo.&lt;ref name="eff gizmodo warrant 1"&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/04/gizmodo-search-warrant-illegal| title = OverREACTing: Dissecting the Gizmodo Warrant| first = Matt| last = Zimmerman| date=April 27, 2010|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[District Attorney]] stated that the investigation was suspended, and discontinued searching through the Gizmodo editor's belongings as they determine whether the shield laws are applicable, and cautioned that no charges have been issued at this point.&lt;ref name="wired finder regret 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/04/iphone-finder|title=iPhone Finder Regrets His 'Mistake'|author1=Chen, Brian |author2=Kim Zetter |date=April 29, 2010|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT apple's response 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/03/business/media/03carr.html|title=A Lost iPhone Shows Apple's Churlish Side|first=David|last=Carr|date=May 2, 2010|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taoviet leak====
Pictures and video of a second prototype were published on a Vietnamese website, Taoviet, on May 12, 2010.&lt;ref name="mercury leak 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_15072831?source%253Dmost_viewed.20F88DA3D7D369F5BB70F372987EAE1F.html&amp;nclick_check=1|title=Another next-generation iPhone surfaces, this one in Vietnam|first=Troy|last=Wolverton|date=May 13, 2010|publisher=[[San Jose Mercury News|Mercury News]]|accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was almost identical to the first, and used an A4 chip manufactured by Apple.&lt;ref name="gizmodo new leak 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/5536912/another-lost-iphone-4-shows-new-details|title=Another Lost iPhone 4 Shows New Details|first=Jesus|last=Diaz|date=May 12, 2010|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|work=[[Gizmodo]]|accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website purchased the prototype for $4,000.&lt;ref name="engadget vietnam leak 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/05/12/next-generation-iphone-escapes-in-vietnam|title=Next generation iPhone unscrewed from Vietnam|first=Thomas|last=Ricker|date=May 12, 2010|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DigiTimes]] reported that the screen resolution of the new phone was 960-by-640, which was confirmed by Apple at the iPhone 4's official announcement.

On January 11, 2011, [[Verizon Wireless]] announced during a media event that it had reached an agreement with Apple and would begin selling a [[CDMA]] iPhone 4 in the United States, ending Apple's exclusivity agreement with AT&amp;T.

On June 24, 2010, Apple stated that the white iPhone 4 models were proving more "challenging to manufacture" than expected, and initially pushed the release date back to the second half of July. There was a lot of speculation surrounding the delay of the white iPhone 4. Among the most popular rumors are those concerning the phone's internal camera being adversely affected by light leaking in due to the semi-translucent glass and the white paint. Other sources report that the problem relates to Apple's inability to match the white color of the front faceplate with that of the home button.&lt;ref name="cnet white iP4 delay 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31021_3-20020819-260.html|title=White iPhone 4 delayed until spring|publisher=CNET|date=|accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|reason=I don't think a reference that states that the claim was heard from a friend counts as a reliable source.|date-December 2013|date=December 2013}} On April 27, 2011, Apple announced that it would be releasing the white iPhone 4 model on April 28, 2011, for both GSM and CDMA.&lt;ref name="ars technica white iP4 release att 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheng|first=Jacqui|title=Finally: white iPhone 4 arrives April 28 on AT&amp;T and Verizon|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/04/finally-white-iphone-4-arrives-april-28-on-att-and-verizon.ars|publisher=[[Ars Technica]]|accessdate=April 27, 2011|date=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of the white iPhone 4 was carried out on April 28.&lt;ref name="apple white iP4 release 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=White iPhone 4 currently available for purchase|url=http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_iphone/family/iphone?mco=MTAyNTQzMjI|accessdate=May 21, 2011|date=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verizon white iP4 release 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=iPhone 4, now available in white|url=http://www.verizonwireless.com/iphone.shtml|accessdate=September 16, 2011|date=September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Apple's official unveiling of the [[iPhone 4S]] on October 4, 2011, it was announced that [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] would begin carrying the reconfigured CDMA iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4S in the US on October 14.&lt;ref name="laptopmag sprint iP4S release 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.laptopmag.com/199-iphone-4s-vs-99-iphone-4-whats-the-better-deal|title=$199 iPhone 4S vs. $99 iPhone 4: What's the Better Deal?|publisher=LaptopMag|date=October 5, 2011|accessdate=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="australian iP4S release 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/australian-it/apple-unveils-theiphone-4s-at-event-at-cupertino/story-e6frgakx-1226158624667|title=Apple unveils the iPhone 4S at event at Cupertino|publisher=AustralianIT|date=October 5, 2011|accessdate=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discontinuation ===
In September 2013, after the release of the [[iPhone 5S]] and [[iPhone 5C]], Apple stopped selling the iPhone 4 in most of their stores as well as on their website. It was replaced by the 8 GB iPhone 4S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://live.cnet.com/Event/CNETs_Apple_Sept_10_event_live_blog?Page=15|title = CNET's Apple Sept. 10 event live blog|date = September 10, 2013|accessdate = September 10, 2013|publisher = CBS Interactive|website = [[CNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/10/4716548/apple-still-selling-iphone-4-in-china|title=Apple still selling three-year-old iPhone 4 in China|author=Chris Welch|date=|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge|accessdate=November 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.apple.com/cn/buy-iphone/iphone4|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190153/http://store.apple.com/cn/buy-iphone/iphone4|title=iPhone 4 - 购买一部无需合约、不限定 SIM 卡格式的 iPhone 4，还能享受免费、快捷的送货上门服务。  - Apple Store（中国）|date=|archivedate=October 29, 2013|work=apple.com|accessdate=November 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Display===
{{See also|Retina Display}}
The display of the iPhone 4 was manufactured by [[LG Display|LG]] under an exclusive contract with Apple. It features an [[LED backlit]] [[liquid crystal display|TFT LCD]] [[capacitive touchscreen|capacitive]] [[touchscreen]] with a pixel density of 326 [[pixel density|pixels per inch]] (ppi) on a {{convert|3.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} (diagonally measured), 960×640 display. Each pixel is 78 [[micrometer]]s in width. The display has a [[contrast ratio]] of 800:1. The screen was marketed by Apple as the "Retina display", based on the assertion that a display of approximately 300 ppi at a distance of {{convert|305|mm|inch|0}} from one's eye, or 57 [[arcsecond]]s per pixel&lt;ref name="arctan sum 1"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\arctan\big(\tfrac{1/300}{12}\big)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is the maximum amount of detail that the human [[retina]] can perceive.&lt;ref name="PCW display explained 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/198201/iphone_4s_retina_display_explained.html|title=iPhone 4's Retina Display Explained|first=Chris|last=Brandrick|date=June 8, 2010|publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|accessdate=June 18, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828060038/http://www.pcworld.com/article/198201/iphone_4s_retina_display_explained.html|archive-date=August 28, 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the iPhone expected to be used at a distance of about 12&amp;nbsp;inches from the eyes, a higher resolution would allegedly have no effect on the image's apparent quality as the maximum potential of the human eye has already been met.

This claim was widely disputed. Raymond Soneira, president of DisplayMate Technologies, said in an interview with the [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'' magazine]], that the claims by Jobs are something of an exaggeration: "It is reasonably close to being a perfect display, but Steve pushed it a little too far". Soneira stated that the resolution of the human retina is higher than claimed by Apple, working out to 477 PPI at {{convert|12|inch|mm|0}} from the eyes, or 36 arcseconds per pixel.&lt;ref name="PCW display challenge 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2364871,00.asp|title=Analyst Challenges Apple's iPhone 4 'Retina Display' Claims|first=Mark|last=Hachman|date=June 9, 2010|work=[[PC Magazine]]|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Phil Plait]], author of ''[[Bad Astronomy]]'', whose career includes a collaboration with [[NASA]] regarding the camera on the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], responded to the criticism by stating that "if you have [better than 20/20] eyesight, then at one foot away the iPhone 4's pixels are resolved. The picture will look pixellated. If you have average eyesight, the picture will look just fine".&lt;ref name="discovermag display non-issue 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/06/10/resolving-the-iphone-resolution|title=Resolving the iPhone resolution|first=Phil|last=Plait|authorlink=Phil Plait|date=June 10, 2010|publisher=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover Magazine]]|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="engadget display explained 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/06/10/iphone-4s-retina-display-claim-put-under-the-math-microscope|title=iPhone 4's retina display claim put under the math microscope|first=Vlad|last=Savov|date=June 10, 2010|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Camera===
[[File:IPhone 4 cameras.png|thumb|The iPhone 4 is the first iPhone [[list of iOS devices#iPhone|model]] to have two cameras. The LED flash for the rear-facing camera (top) and the forward-facing camera (bottom, left of the speaker) are not present in older models.]]
The iPhone 4 features an additional front-facing [[VGA]] camera, and a backside-illuminated 5 [[megapixel]] rear-facing camera with a 3.85&amp;nbsp;mm f/2.8 lens&lt;ref name="ars technica iP4 camer 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/06/sizing-up-the-iphone-4-for-shutterbugs.ars|title=Sizing up the iPhone 4 for shutterbugs|publisher=[[Ars Technica]]|date=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160713155738/http://pocketnow.com/iphone/iphone-5-first-test-photo] and an [[LED flashlight|LED]] flash. The rear-facing 5-megapixel camera is capable of recording [[high-definition video|HD video]] in [[720p]] at 30 [[frame rate|frames per second]]. Both cameras make use of the ''tap to focus'' feature, part of iOS 4, for photo and video recording.&lt;ref name="macrumors iP4 camer quality 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2010/06/08/a-look-at-iphone-4s-camera-quality|title=A Look at iPhone 4's Camera Quality|first=Eric|last=Slivka|date=June 8, 2010|publisher=[[MacRumors]]|accessdate=June 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rear-facing camera has a 5× [[digital zoom]].&lt;!--only photos or video too?--&gt;

===Connectivity===
In contrast to Steve Jobs' announcement at WWDC 2010, recent [[Federal Communications Commission]] documentation showed that, in fact, the iPhone 4 contains a [[multi-band|penta-band]] [[3G]] [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]] antenna, not a quad-band 3G UMTS radio, as advertised by Apple. According to the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] documentation filed by Apple, the radio inside the iPhone 4 supports 800, 850, 900, 1,900, and 2,100&amp;nbsp;MHz. The 800&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency, which is most commonly used in Japanese mobile phones, is not advertised as being supported by Apple.&lt;ref name="engadget iP4 bands 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/06/07/iphone-4-hits-fcc-becomes-worlds-second-announced-pentaband-3g/2|title=iPhone 4 hits FCC, becomes world's second announced pentaband 3G phone|first=Vlad|last=Savov|date=June 7, 2010|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=July 25, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224222421/http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/07/iphone-4-hits-fcc-becomes-worlds-second-announced-pentaband-3g/2|archivedate=December 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 800&amp;nbsp;MHz band is a subset of the 850&amp;nbsp;MHz band, which probably explains why the device was advertised as quad-band.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The chip-sets were manufactured by [[Skyworks Solutions]]&lt;ref name="chipworks iP4 teardown 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chipworks.com/en/technical-competitive-analysis/resources/recent-teardowns/2010/06/silicon-teardown-of-the-apple-iphone-4-smart-phone|title=Teardown of the Apple iPhone 4 Smart Phone » Recent Teardowns|publisher=Chipworks|date=June 23, 2010|accessdate=August 30, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820021559/http://www.chipworks.com/en/technical-competitive-analysis/resources/recent-teardowns/2010/06/silicon-teardown-of-the-apple-iphone-4-smart-phone|archive-date=August 20, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Infineon]] for GSM version.

As with most of Apple's mobile products at the time, the iPhone 4 also used the [[Dock Connector#Apple 30 pin dock connector|30 pin dock connector]] as its only external data port.

The iPhone 4 is the first generation of iPhone to have a second [[Noise-canceling microphone|microphone]] used for [[noise cancellation]]. It is located on the top of the unit near the headphone jack; the main microphone is on the bottom left.&lt;ref name="apple iP4 phone features 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/features/phone.html|title=iPhone 4 – Learn about phone and voicemail features|publisher=Apple|date=|accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gyroscope and accelerometer===
The iPhone 4 introduces a [[Vibrating structure gyroscope|gyroscopic sensor]] that detects 3-axis angular acceleration around the [[Cartesian coordinate system|X, Y, and Z axes]], enabling precise calculation of [[yaw, pitch, and roll]]. The gyroscope complements the [[accelerometer]], a sensor that has been present since the [[iPhone (original)|original iPhone]], which detects the device's acceleration, shake, vibration shock, or fall by detecting linear acceleration along with one of three axes (X, Y, and Z). The combined data from the accelerometer and the gyroscope provides detailed and precise information about the device's 6-axis movement in space. The 3 axes of the gyroscope combined with the 3 axes of the accelerometer enable the device to recognize approximately how far, fast, and in which direction it has moved in space.&lt;ref name="appleinsider iP4 gyro gaming 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/06/16/inside_iphone_4_gyro_spins_apple_ahead_in_gaming.html&amp;page=2|title=Inside iPhone 4: Gyro spins Apple ahead in gaming|first=Daniel Eran|last=Dilger|date=June 16, 2010|publisher=[[AppleInsider]]|page=2|accessdate=June 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clock speed in the iPhone 4 was never disclosed. All prior [[list of iOS devices#iPhone|models]] of the iPhone had [[underclock]]ed the CPU, which typically extends battery life and lowers [[CPU power dissipation|heat dissipation]].

The iPhone 4 has 512 MB of [[DRAM]].

Unlike prior generations, the storage capacity is not printed on the back of the unit.

The iPhone 4 uses a [[Subscriber Identity Module#micro-SIM|micro-SIM card]] on iPhone 4 devices running on a GSM network, which is positioned in an ejectable tray, located on the right side of the device. On a CDMA network, however, the phone connects to the network using an [[Electronic Serial Number|ESN]]. All prior models have used regular [[Subscriber Identity Module#mini-SIM|mini-SIM]] cards. Depending on the operator, micro-SIM cards may not be available for all networks globally. As a technical workaround it is possible to trim a mini-SIM card with a knife or scissors so that it fits into the micro-SIM tray.&lt;ref name="wired iP4 microsim 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/05/sim-trim-cutting-card-down-to-microsim-size|title=Trimming a sim to micro-sim size|first=Charlie|last=Sorrel|date=May 6, 2010|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:IPhone 4 Black.jpg|thumb|The iPhone 4 is constructed of glass faces and a metal rim.]]
The iPhone 4 features a redesigned structure, designed by [[Jony Ive]], a design that would later be reused and adapted for the [[iPhone 4S]], [[iPhone 5|5]], [[iPhone 5S|5S]] and [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone SE]]. Most notably, the bulges of the back panel as well as the band between the front and back are gone and have been replaced with flattened surfaces. The redesign reflects the [[Utilitarianism (architecture)|utilitarianism]] and uniformity of existing Apple products, such as the [[iPad]] and the [[iMac]]. The overall dimensions of the iPhone 4 have been reduced from its predecessor.&lt;ref name="Helf, Miguel"&gt;{{cite news|title=On Newest iPhone, Another Camera|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/08/technology/08apple.html?scp=7&amp;sq=iPhone%204&amp;st=cse|accessdate=July 18, 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 7, 2010|author=Helf, Miguel|author2=Wortham, Jenna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is {{convert|115|mm|inch}} high, {{convert|58.6|mm|inch}} wide, and {{convert|9.4|mm|inch}} deep, compared to the iPhone 3GS, which is {{convert|116|mm|inch}} high, {{convert|62|mm|inch}} wide, and {{convert|12|mm|inch}} deep; making the iPhone 4 24% thinner than its predecessor, the [[iPhone 3GS]]. [[Steve Jobs]] claimed it to be "the thinnest smartphone on the planet."&lt;ref name="Helf, Miguel"/&gt; The reduced size of the device is primarily due to the externally placed antenna.

The iPhone 4 is structured around a [[stainless steel]] frame that wraps around the edge of the phone, acting both as the primary structure for the device and as the iPhone 4's antennas. This metal band features two slits on the [[GSM]] version of the phone, one at the lower left, and one at the top (and a fake slit along the lower right, to cosmetically mirror the one at the lower left) that divide the band into two antenna sections: the left section of the band serves as the [[Bluetooth]], [[Wi-Fi]], and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] antenna, and the right and lower sections of the band act as the antenna for GSM and [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]] connectivity.

On the CDMA version of the phone, there are four slits in the metal band. Two at the top (on the left and right) and two at the bottom. This divides the metal band into four different segments, which like the GSM version of the phone, serves as different antennas for connectivity. The top portion of the band (divided by the top left and right slits) is for connecting to the [[CDMA]] network. The left portion of the metal band is for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS just like the GSM version. The right side is not an antenna but serves to cosmetically mirror the left side and also to create a similar look to the GSM version of the phone.

The internal components are situated between two panels of [[aluminosilicate]] glass, described by Apple as being "chemically strengthened to be 20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic," theoretically allowing it to be more scratch-resistant and durable than the prior models.&lt;ref name="Definitive Guide"&gt;{{cite web|last=Diaz|first=Jesus|title=iPhone 4: The Definitive Guide|url=https://gizmodo.com/5557101/iphone-4-the-definitive-guide|publisher=[[Gizmodo]]|accessdate=June 19, 2010|date=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
{{See also|iOS|iOS 4|iOS 5|iOS 6|iOS 7}}{{Further|iOS version history}}
The iPhone 4 shipped with [[iOS 4]], which was the newest version of Apple's [[iOS]] [[mobile operating system]] at the time. iOS 4 introduced a multitasking system, allowing apps to remain "suspended" in memory, perform certain operations in the background, and allowing users to switch between apps using an on-screen menu.&lt;ref name="PCWorld1-multitasking"&gt;{{cite web|last=Perenson|first=Melissa|title=Multitasking on Apple's iPhone 4: How Does It Work?|url=http://www.techhive.com/article/198296/iphone_4_multitasking.html|work=PC World|accessdate=April 14, 2013|date=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also introduced [[FaceTime]], which allows users to perform video calls between other iPhone, [[iPad]], [[iPod Touch]], and [[OS X]] users.

The iPhone 4 supports up to [[iOS 7]], released in September 2013. Due to the relatively aged hardware of the iPhone 4, certain features available on newer iPhone models are not available on the device; as of iOS 7, they include [[Siri]], 3D [[Apple Maps|maps]] and turn-by-turn navigation, [[AirDrop]], [[AirPlay]] mirroring, live camera filters, panorama mode and certain visual effects introduced by iOS 7, such as the blurring of translucent interface elements, the [[parallax]] effect on the home screen, and live wallpapers.&lt;ref name=ars-ios7-iphone4&gt;{{cite web|title=New lease on life or death sentence? iOS 7 on the iPhone 4|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/09/new-lease-on-life-or-death-sentence-ios-7-on-the-iphone-4/|work=Ars Technica|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While still subject to the same limitations, iOS 7.1 did bring some slight performance improvements to the operating system on the iPhone 4. iOS 7, specifically iOS 7.1.2, is the last version of iOS to support the iPhone 4. Unlike the iPhone 4S, the iPhone 4 did not receive the iOS 8 update due to performance issues.&lt;ref name=ars-tenten8requirements&gt;{{cite web|title=PSA: The iDevices and Macs that will support iOS 8 and OS X 10.10|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/06/psa-the-idevices-and-macs-that-will-support-ios-8-and-os-x-10-10/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-asgood&gt;{{cite web|title=iOS 7.1 on the iPhone 4: As good as it’s going to get|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/03/ios-7-1-on-the-iphone-4-as-good-as-its-going-to-get/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accessories==

===Bumper===
[[File:Apple iPhone 4 Bumper.jpg|thumb|An iPhone 4 next to a Bumper.]]
An iPhone 4 Bumper is a ring of rubber and plastic that surrounds the edge of the iPhone 4, to protect the phone. The inner part is rubber with the external band made of plastic. The Bumper wraps around the edges of the device protecting the edges, and to a lesser extent, the screen. The Bumper does not cover the front or rear of the phone, though it does slightly raise the iPhone off whatever surface it is sitting on.&lt;ref name="iPhone 4 Bumper review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/reviews/pc-peripheral/3232155/apple-iphone-4-bumper-review |title=Apple iPhone 4 Bumper review |first=Mark |last=Hattersley |date=July 16, 2010 |work=[[PC Advisor (magazine)|PC Advisor]] |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |location=United Kingdom |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5yLHCznOW?url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/reviews/pc-peripheral/3232155/apple-iphone-4-bumper-review/ |archive-date=April 30, 2011 |access-date=April 30, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the plastic band houses metallic buttons for the volume controls and sleep/wake button. The six holes in the Bumper enable access to the mute switch, dock connector, headphone jack, speaker, and microphones.&lt;ref name="iPhone 4 Bumper review"/&gt;

Apple updated the bumper with a wider volume switch hole with the release of the iPhone 4 for CDMA networks. The updated bumper is also compatible with [[iPhone 4S]], the next-generation iPhone that has the same exterior design and measurements as the CDMA model of the iPhone 4, but with a SIM card slot as well.

==Reception==

===Pre-release===
Pre-release reception was generally positive.&lt;ref name="NYT review 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/23/iphone-4-reviews-the-pundits-weigh-in|title=iPhone 4 Reviews: The Pundits Weigh In|first=Nick|last=Bilton|work=The New York Times|date=June 23, 2010|accessdate=June 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement included information that had not been covered by Gizmodo. [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] commented that "seeing it in action is far more informative than staring at Gizmodo's photos of a busted test unit".&lt;ref name="fox q+a 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/06/08/apple-iphone-questions-answered|title=Your iPhone 4 Questions Answered|first=Harry|last=McCracken|publisher=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]|date=June 8, 2010|accessdate=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rhodri Marsden]] of [[The Independent]] said that "aside from the introduction of face-to-face video calling, it's not a staggering feature set," instead focusing on how the device is "more powerful than its predecessor, speedier, easier to use and will make previously laborious tasks seem like a cinch".&lt;ref name="indie more powerful 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/rhodri-marsden-you-might-not-like-it-but--jobs-has-set-the-pace-1994092.html|title=You might not like it, but Jobs has set the pace|first=Rhodri|last=Marsden|authorlink=Rhodri Marsden|work=The Independent|date=June 8, 2010|accessdate=July 13, 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Medvedev and Steve Jobs.jpg|thumb|[[Steve Jobs]] demonstrating the iPhone 4 to Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] on June 23, 2010]]
[[CNET]] reacted to the announcement by explaining how it believes that [[iMovie#iMovie for iOS|iMovie for iOS]] was the "most exciting part of this year's WWDC Keynote". The article noted how the iPhone 4, unlike current cameras, can record HD content and then edit it from the same device, labeling it a "true mobile editing suite".&lt;ref name="cnet future filmmaking 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-20007040-233.html|title=iMovie for iPhone 4 and the future of filmmaking|first=Joe|last=Aimonetti|publisher=[[CNET]]|date=June 8, 2010|accessdate=July 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220054654/http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-20007040-233.html|archive-date=December 20, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews===
Reviews of the iPhone 4 were also generally favorable. [[Walt Mossberg]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' called the device "the best device in its class".&lt;ref name="wsj top class phone 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704853404575322951290405346|title=New iPhone Keeps Apple Top of Class|first=Walter|last=Mossberg|authorlink=Walter Mossberg|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=June 20, 2010|accessdate=June 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Engadget]] named it the "best smartphone on the market" in June 2010.&lt;ref name = "Engadget iPhone 4 review"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/06/22/iphone-4-review|title=iPhone 4 review|first=Joshua|last=Topolsky|authorlink=Joshua Ryan|publisher=Engadget|date=June 22, 2010|accessdate=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNET]] gave the iPhone 4 a rating of 8.6 out of 10, one of the highest ratings it had given any smartphone.&lt;ref name="cnet iP4 review 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/apple-iphone-4-32gb/4505-6452_7-34117595.html|title=Apple iPhone 4 – 32GB – black (AT&amp;T) Smartphone reviews|publisher=[[CNET]]|date=June 23, 2010|accessdate=June 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TechRadar]] gave the device 4.5/5 stars.&lt;ref name="TR iP4 review 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/apple-iphone-4-694980/review?artc_pg=15|title=Apple iPhone 4 review|publisher=[[TechRadar]]|date=June 25, 2010|accessdate=June 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer Reports said the signal problem was the reason they did not rate it a "recommended" model, although the other tests ranked it highest among smart phones.&lt;ref name="consumerreports1"/&gt;

[[Joshua Ryan|Joshua Topolsky]] of [[Engadget]] described the device's industrial design as being "more detailed and sophisticated" than its predecessor.&lt;ref name = "Engadget iPhone 4 review"/&gt;

=== Technical problems ===
Some users reported a yellow discoloration of the screen that disappeared after several days, which was attributed to the glass [[lamination]] glue that was used. It did not have time to dry fully before the unit reached consumers due to the speed of manufacturing.&lt;ref name="VB tech issues 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/06/23/iphone-4-problems-crop-up-screen-discoloration-reception-issues-with-antenna-band|title=Apple iPhone 4 problems crop up: screen discoloration, reception issues|first=Devindra|last=Hardawar|date=June 23, 2010|publisher=[[Glam Media|MobileBeat]]|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue reported by some users within days of the iPhone 4 release was that during calls the proximity sensor can be insensitive, so that facial contact with the touchscreen can end calls, mute calls, and dial other numbers.&lt;ref name="AI prox sensor 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/06/28/users_report_issues_with_iphone_4_proximity_sensor_during_calls.html|title=Users report issues with iPhone 4 proximity sensor during calls|date=June 28, 2010|publisher=[[AppleInsider]]|accessdate=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some users reported that, particularly in low-light conditions, photos taken on the iPhone 4 sometimes contained blue or green "splotches."

====Antenna====
Shortly after the iPhone 4 was launched, some consumers reported that signal strength of the phone was reduced when touching the lower left edge of the phone, bridging one of the two locations which separates the two antennas, resulting in dropped calls in some areas with lower signal reception.&lt;ref name="gizmodo reception 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chen|first=Jason|title=iPhone 4 Loses Reception When Holding it By Antenna Band?|url=https://gizmodo.com/5571171/iphone-4-loses-reception-when-you-hold-it-by-the-antenna-band|publisher=[[Gizmodo]]|accessdate=June 24, 2010|date=June 24, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722003653/http://gizmodo.com/5571171/iphone-4-loses-reception-when-you-hold-it-by-the-antenna-band|archivedate=July 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TA australia fans"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/digital-life/iphone/iphone-4-fault-fails-to-surface-for-sydney-fans-20100730-10zsp.html|title=iPhone 4 fault fails to surface for Sydney fans|date=July 31, 2010|accessdate=July 31, 2010|work=The Age|location=Australia|first=Melissa|last=Singer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BDI reception 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Teste de Recepção do iPhone 4|date=July 19, 2010|accessdate=August 9, 2010|publisher=Blog do iPhone|url=http://www.blogdoiphone.com/2010/07/inedito-teste-de-recepcao-do-iphone-4-com-as-operadoras-brasileiras}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Apple issued a statement advising that customers should "avoid gripping [the phone] in the lower left corner" when making or receiving a call.&lt;ref name="BBC holding device 1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cellan-Jones|first=Rory|title=Apple issues advice to avoid iPhone flaw|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8761240.stm|publisher=BBC News Online|accessdate=June 25, 2010|date=June 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internally, senior antenna expert Ruben Caballero raised concerns to CEO Steve Jobs that the antenna design could lead to dropped calls.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-07-15/apple-engineer-said-to-have-told-jobs-last-year-about-iphone-antenna-flaw&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of this problem, it was reported on July 2, 2010 that several iPhone 4 users were planning on suing [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[AT&amp;T]] for fraud by concealment, negligence, intentional misrepresentation and defective design. The legal challenge was started by a law firm, who set up a website to recruit disenchanted iPhone 4 buyers for a lawsuit against Apple.&lt;ref name="sky sued 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Technology/iPhone-4-Apple-Is-Sued-After-Complaints-Of-Reception-Problems-With-The-New-Smartphone/Article/201007115658175?|title=iPhone 4: Apple Is Sued After Complaints Of Reception Problems With The New Smartphone|last=Hewage|first=Tim|date=July 2, 2010|publisher=[[Sky News]]|accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yahoo sued 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20100701/tc_nm/us_apple_lawsuits|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705181954/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20100701/tc_nm/us_apple_lawsuits|archivedate=July 5, 2010|title=Consumers sue Apple over iPhone antenna problems|author1=Madway, Gabriel|author2=Grenon, Andre|date=July 1, 2010|publisher=[[Yahoo!

Apple explained how the formula it used to calculate the number of bars to display was "wrong". Apple promised to correct the issue and release a software update within a few weeks that would address the "mistake", which had been present since the original [[iPhone (original)|iPhone]].&lt;ref name = "Statement by Apple on iPhone 4 reception issues"&gt;{{Cite press release|title=Statement by Apple on iPhone 4 reception issues|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|date=July 2, 2010|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/07/02appleletter.html|accessdate=July 2, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703161217/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/07/02appleletter.html|archive-date=July 3, 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that "the failure to detect this longstanding problem earlier is astonishing."&lt;ref name="NYT signal bars 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/03/technology/03apple.html|title=Apple Acknowledges Flaw in iPhone Signal Meter|last=Helft|first=Miguel|date=July 2, 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=July 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Consumer Reports]]'' initially stated that the iPhone 4's signal issues are not "unique, and may not be serious" and it continued to mention that signal loss is a problem that is faced by the entire smartphone industry. It was such a problem that Apple made a formal apology onstage. The next day, the magazine altered their stance after encountering instances of dropped calls.&lt;ref name="CR signal issue 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.consumerreports.org/electronics/2010/07/apple-iphone-4-antenna-problems-dropped-calls-att-signals-bars-os-software-bugs-glitches-os-os4-iphone4-reception-problems-in.html |title=Consumer Reports Electronics Blog: iPhone 4's supposed signal woes aren't unique, and may not be serious |publisher=Blogs.consumerreports.org |date=July 2, 2010 |accessdate=November 11, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204002618/http://blogs.consumerreports.org/electronics/2010/07/apple-iphone-4-antenna-problems-dropped-calls-att-signals-bars-os-software-bugs-glitches-os-os4-iphone4-reception-problems-in.html |archive-date=December 4, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine rejected Apple's explanation after conducting tests in a controlled environment, and comparing the results against prior generations of iPhone. It sarcastically pointed out that using a piece of tape to cover the lower left antenna gap was one way to fix the problem, but recommended that consumers who "want an iPhone that works well without a masking-tape fix" purchase the [[iPhone 3GS]] instead.&lt;ref name="consumerreports1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.consumerreports.org/electronics/2010/07/apple-iphone-4-antenna-issue-iphone4-problems-dropped-calls-lab-test-confirmed-problem-issues-signal-strength-att-network-gsm.html|title=Lab tests: Why Consumer Reports can't recommend the iPhone 4|date=July 12, 2010|publisher=[[Consumer Reports]]|accessdate=July 12, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219233245/http://blogs.consumerreports.org/electronics/2010/07/apple-iphone-4-antenna-issue-iphone4-problems-dropped-calls-lab-test-confirmed-problem-issues-signal-strength-att-network-gsm.html|archive-date=February 19, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine also tested the iPhone 4 while it was wearing a ''[[#Bumper|Bumper]]'', a frame-like cover sold by Apple that prevents direct contact with the antenna, reporting that it did resolve the problem.&lt;ref name="CR bumper 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.consumerreports.org/electronics/2010/07/apple-iphone4-iphone-4-bumper-case-fixes-antenna-issue-problem-signal-loss-tested-verified-consumer-reports-labs-quick-fix.html|title=Apple's Bumper case alleviates the iPhone 4 signal-loss problem|date=July 13, 2010|publisher=[[Consumer Reports]]|accessdate=July 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204161703/http://blogs.consumerreports.org/electronics/2010/07/apple-iphone4-iphone-4-bumper-case-fixes-antenna-issue-problem-signal-loss-tested-verified-consumer-reports-labs-quick-fix.html|archive-date=December 4, 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[CNN]]'' repeated ''Consumer Reports''' statement that a small amount of [[duct tape]] had proven an effective fix to the iPhone 4's dropped call issue.&lt;ref name="CNN duct tape fix 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/07/13/iphone.4.duct.tape/index.html?hpt=C1|title=iPhone duct tape fix|publisher=CNN|date=July 13, 2010|accessdate=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 2010, at a press conference which included a private tour of Apple's antenna design lab for journalists,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/2010/07/apple-antenna-lab/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Jobs]] announced that Apple would provide all iPhone 4 owners with a free case to help solve the antenna issue and a refund to those users who had already purchased a Bumper. The free case offer would be valid until September 30, 2010, when Apple would re-evaluate the situation.&lt;ref name="NYT free cases 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/technology/17apple.html|title=Apple Offers Free Cases to Address iPhone Issue|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 16, 2010|first=Miguel|last=Helft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNSC free bumpers 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothman|first=Wilson|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/38263228|title=Apple gives free bumpers to all iPhone 4 owners|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=July 17, 2010|accessdate=July 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To get a free case, owners were able to apply via an app installed on the phone found in the App Store from July 22, 2010 to September 30, 2010. Jobs also announced that Apple could not produce enough Bumpers for all owners of the phone, but would source a supply and offer a range of cases.&lt;ref name="Apple offers free iPhone 4 cases"&gt;{{cite news|title=Apple offers free iPhone 4 cases|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-10665424|publisher=BBC News Online|accessdate=July 19, 2010|date=July 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Jobs cited figures from [[AppleCare]] which showed that only 0.55 percent of all iPhone 4 users have complained to the company about the issue, while the number of phones returned to Apple was 1.7 percent – 4.3 percentage points less than the number of iPhone 3GS models that were returned in the first month of the phone's launch.&lt;ref name="Apple offers free iPhone 4 cases"/&gt;

''Consumer Reports'' noted that the solution was not permanent, though a good first step.&lt;ref name="CNN bumper fix 1"&gt;{{cite news|last=D.

Despite the negative media attention regarding the antenna issues, 72% of iPhone 4 users say that they are "very satisfied" with their iPhone 4 according to an August 2010 survey by ChangeWave Research.&lt;ref name="PCW users satisfied 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/202625/survey_most_iphone_4_users_very_satisfied.html?tk=hp_blg|title=Survey: Most iPhone 4 Users 'Very Satisfied'|publisher=PCWorld|date=August 5, 2010|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPhone 4 model continued to be sold unchanged up until September 2013.

In 2011, two iPhone 4 units equipped with a special application were taken to the [[International Space Station]] aboard the [[Space Shuttle]] on the [[STS-135]] mission.&lt;ref name=paul2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/230166/apples_iphone_4_hired_as_tricorder_for_space_station.html#tk.mod_rel|title=Apple's iPhone 4 Hired as Tricorder for Space Station|date=June 13, 2011|work=PCWorld|accessdate=November 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The devices were used in various experiments, utilizing sensors and a special app.&lt;ref name=paul2/&gt;
