{{Lang|la|'''Italia'''|italics=no}} (the [[Latin]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] name for the [[Italian Peninsula]]) was the [[ancient Rome|homeland of the Romans]] and [[metropole]] of Rome's [[Roman Empire|empire]] in [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=Pr__AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Italy+Romah+homeland&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix1O6trsneAhUDyoUKHYYTDJAQ6AEIMzAC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/hannibalswarmili00laze/page/29 &lt;!-- quote=Italy homeland of the Romans. --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=OXqfCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT375&amp;dq=Italia+roman+homeland&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmtfqDr8neAhUkxoUKHVfNBkIQ6AEILTAB]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=twEOAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Italy+homeland+of+the+Romans&amp;dq=Italy+homeland+of+the+Romans&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-7MWhr8neAhVB4YUKHUr3C08Q6AEIUDAH]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Roman mythology]], Italy was the ancestral home promised by [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] to [[Aeneas|Aeneas of Troy]] and his descendants, whose descendants were the [[Romulus and Remus|founders of Rome]]. Aside from the legendary accounts, Rome was an Italic city-state that changed its form of government from [[Kingdom of Rome|kingdom]] to [[Roman Republic|republic]] and then grew within the context of a peninsula dominated by the [[Celts]] in the [[Northern Italy|North]], the [[Etruscans]] and [[Umbri]]ans in the [[Central Italy|Centre]], and the [[Messapians]] (Illyrian Colonies) and [[Greeks]] colonies in the south.

The consolidation of Italy into a single entity occurred during the [[Roman expansion in Italy|Roman expansion in the peninsula]], when Rome formed a [[Socii|permanent association]] with most of the local tribes and cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mommsen |first=Theodor |author-link=Theodor Mommsen |year=1855 |title=[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|History of Rome]], Book II: From the Abolition of the Monarchy in Rome to the Union of Italy |location=Leipzig |publisher=Reimer &amp; Hirsel |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of the Italian confederacy was a crucial factor in the [[rise of Rome]], starting with the [[Punic wars|Punic]] and [[Macedonian wars|Macedonian]] wars between the 3rd and 2nd century BC. As [[provinces]] were being established throughout the Mediterranean, Italy maintained a special status which made it "not a province, but the {{lang|la|[[Dominus (title)|Domina]]}} (ruler) of the provinces".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=fVylk1KUS84C&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=Italia+domina+provinciarum&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwigou3NgL_cAhWS2KQKHS56DW0Q6AEIODAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Italia%20domina%20provinciarum&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Such a status meant that Roman magistrates exercised the {{lang|la|[[Imperium]] domi}} (police power) within Italy, rather than the {{lang|la|Imperium militiae}} (military power) used abroad. Italy's inhabitants had [[Latin Rights]] as well as religious and financial privileges.

The period between the end of the 2nd century BC and the 1st century BC was [[Roman Revolution|turbulent]], beginning with the [[Servile Wars]], continuing with the opposition of [[Optimates|aristocratic élite]] to [[Populares|populist reformers]] and leading to a [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]] in the middle of Italy. However, [[Roman citizenship]] was recognized to the rest of the Italics by the end of the conflict and then extended to [[Cisalpine Gaul]] when [[Julius Caesar]] became [[Roman Dictator]]. In the context  of the transition [[constitutional reforms of Augustus|from Republic to Principate]], Italy swore allegiance to [[Octavian Augustus]] and was then organized in eleven regions from the [[Alps]] to the [[Ionian Sea]].

More than [[Pax Romana|two centuries of stability]] followed, during which Italy was referred to as the {{lang|la|rectrix mundi}} (queen of the world) and {{lang|la|omnium terrarum parens}} (motherland of all lands).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=hb6OAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=Rectrix+mundi+omnium+terrarum+parens&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Rn5pY8cajH&amp;sig=EulWbXUWwV5sludG6RzQCSINQdw&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiP45Gp5b3cAhWSdt4KHRdhDzAQ6AEwAXoECAIQAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; Several emperors made notable accomplishments in this period: [[Claudius]] incorporated Britain into the Roman Empire, [[Vespasian]] subjugated the [[Great Revolt of Judea]] and reformed the financial system, [[Trajan]] conquered [[Dacia]] and defeated [[Parthia]], and [[Marcus Aurelius]] epitomized the ideal of the [[philosopher king]].

The [[crisis of the third century]] hit Italy particularly hard and left the eastern half of the Empire more prosperous. In 286 AD the Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]] moved the capital of the [[Western Roman Empire]] from Rome to [[Mediolanum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://milano.corriere.it/foto-gallery/cronaca/16_febbraio_12/antica-mediolanum-rivive-computer-milano-romana-circo-anfiteatro-urbanfile-blog-66026574-d1af-11e5-9819-2c2b53be318b.shtml Video of Roman Milan] {{in lang|it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the islands of [[Corsica]], [[Sardinia]], [[Sicily]] and [[Malta]] were added to Italy by [[Diocletian]] in 292 AD, and Italian cities such as Mediolanum and [[Ravenna]] continued to serve as capitals for the West.

The [[Bishop of Rome]] gained importance during [[Constantine]]'s reign and was given religious primacy with the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] under [[Theodosius I]]. Italy was invaded several times by the [[barbarian]]s and fell under the control of [[Odoacer]], when [[Deposition of Romulus Augustus|Romulus Augustus was deposed]] in 476 AD. In the sixth century, Italy's territory was divided between the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and the [[Germanic peoples]].{{elucidate|reason=Vast oversimplification|date=June 2019}} After that, Italy remained divided until 1861, when [[Italian unification|it was reunited]] in the [[Kingdom of Italy]], which became the present-day [[Italy|Italian Republic]] in 1946.

Following the end of the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]] in 88 BC, Rome had allowed [[socii|its Italian allies]] full rights in Roman society and granted [[Roman citizenship]] to all the [[Italic peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keaveney |first=Arthur |year=1987 |title=Rome and the Unification of Italy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojoOAAAAQAAJ |location=London |publisher=Croom Helm |isbn=9781904675372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After having been for centuries the heart of the [[Roman Empire]], from the 3rd century the government and the cultural center began to move eastward: first the [[Constitutio Antoniniana|Edict of Caracalla]] in 212 AD extended Roman citizenship to all free men within the imperial boundaries. Then, [[Christianity]] became the dominant religion during [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]]'s reign (306–337), raising the power of other [[Pentarchy|Eastern political centres]]. Although not founded as a capital city in 330, [[Constantinople]] grew in importance. It finally gained the rank of eastern capital when given an [[urban prefect]] in 359 and the [[Senate of the Roman Empire|senators]] who were ''clari'' became senators of the lowest rank as ''[[clarissimus|clarissimi]]''.

As a result, Italy began to decline in favour of the provinces, which resulted in the division of the Empire into two administrative units in 395: the [[Western Roman Empire]], with its capital at [[Mediolanum]] (now [[Milan]]), and the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], with its capital at [[Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]). In 402, the capital was moved to [[Ravenna]] from Milan, confirming the decline of the city of Rome (which was [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacked]] in 410 for the first time in seven centuries).

==History==
The name ''Italia'' covered an area whose borders evolved over time. According to [[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica]]'', before the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]], the name was used by Greeks to indicate the land between the [[strait of Messina]] and the line connecting the [[gulf of Salerno]] and [[gulf of Taranto]] (corresponding roughly to the current region of [[Calabria]]); later the term was extended by Romans to include the [[Italian Peninsula]] up to the [[Rubicon]], a river located between [[Northern Italy|Northern]] and [[Central Italy]].

In 49 BC, with the ''[[Lex Roscia]]'', [[Julius Caesar]] gave Roman citizenship to the people of the [[Cisalpine Gaul]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cassius|first1=Dio|authorlink=Cassius Dio|title=Historia Romana|volume=41|at=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 42 BC the hitherto existing province was abolished, thus extending Italy to the north up to the southern foot of the [[Alps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laffi|first1=Umberto|title=La provincia della Gallia Cisalpina|date=1992|journal=Athenaeum|issue=80|location=Firenze|pages=5–23|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=au&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aurigemma|first1=Salvatore|title=Gallia Cisalpina|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/gallia-cisalpina_(Enciclopedia-Italiana)/|website=www.treccani.it|publisher=Enciclopedia Italiana|accessdate=14 October 2014|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Augustus, the peoples of today's [[Aosta Valley]] and of the western and northern Alps were subjugated (so the western border of Roman Italy was moved to the [[Var (river)|Varus river]]), and the Italian eastern border was brought to the [[Raša (river)|Arsia]] in [[Istria]].&lt;ref name=au/&gt; Lastly, in the late 3rd century, Italy came to also include the islands of [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]], [[Corsica and Sardinia]], as well as [[Raetia]] and part of [[Pannonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/297743/Italy |title=Italy (ancient Roman territory) |website=britannica.com |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Emona]] (modern [[Ljubljana]], Slovenia) was the easternmost town of Italy.

===Augustan organization===
At the beginning of the Roman imperial era, Italy was a collection of territories with different political statuses. Some cities, called ''[[municipium|municipia]]'', had some independence from Rome, while others, the ''[[Colonia (Roman)|coloniae]]'', were founded by the Romans themselves. Around 7 BC, [[Augustus]] divided Italy into eleven ''regiones'', as reported by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Naturalis Historia]]'':

Italy was privileged by Augustus and his heirs, with the construction, among other public structures, of a dense network of [[Roman roads]]. The Italian economy flourished: agriculture, handicraft and industry had a sensible growth, allowing the export of goods to the other provinces.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The Italian population may have grown as well: three census were ordered by Augustus, to record the number of Roman citizens throughout the empire. The surviving totals were 4,063,000 in 28 BC, 4,233,000 in 8 BC, and 4,937,000 in AD 14, but it is still debated whether these counted all citizens, all adult male citizens, or citizens ''[[sui iuris]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hin |first=Saskia |year=2007 |title=Counting Romans |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/hin/110703.pdf |location=Leiden |publisher=Princeton/Stanford Working Papers }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates for the population of mainland Italy, including Cisalpine Gaul, at the beginning of the 1st century range from 6,000,000 according to [[Karl Julius Beloch]] in 1886, to 14,000,000 according to [[Elio Lo Cascio]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lo Cascio |first=Elio |author-link=Elio Lo Cascio |year=2009 |title=Urbanization as a Proxy of Demographic and Economic Growth |location=Oxford |publisher=Scholarship Online |url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199562596.001.0001/acprof-9780199562596-chapter-2 |isbn=9780199562596 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diocletian and Constantinian re-organizations{{anchor|Diocletian re-organization|Constantinian re-organization}}===
During the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] the Roman Empire nearly collapsed under the combined pressures of invasions, military anarchy and civil wars, and hyperinflation. In 284, emperor [[Diocletian]] restored political stability. He carried out thorough administrative reforms to maintain order. He created the so-called [[Tetrarchy]] whereby the empire was ruled by two senior emperors called [[Augustus (honorific)|Augusti]] and two junior vice-emperors called Caesars. He decreased the size of the [[Roman province]]s by doubling their number to reduce the power of the provincial governors. He grouped the provinces into several [[Roman diocese|diocese]]s (Latin: diocesis) and put them under the supervision of the imperial [[vicarius]] (vice, deputy), who was the head of the diocese. During the Crisis of the Third Century the importance of Rome declined because the city was far from the troubled frontiers. Diocletian and his colleagues usually resided in four imperial seats. The Augusti, Diocletian and [[Maximian]], who were responsible for the East and West respectively, established themselves at [[Nicomedia]], in north-western [[Anatolia]] (closer to the  Persian frontier in the east) and [[Milan]], in northern Italy (closer to the European frontiers) respectively. The seats of the Caesars were [[Augusta Treverorum]] (on the River [[Rhine]] frontier) for [[Constantius Chlorus]] and [[Sirmium]] (on the River [[Danube]] frontier) for [[Galerius]] who also resided at Thessaloniki.

Under Diocletian Italy became the '''Dioecesis Italiciana'''. It included [[Raetia]]. It was subdivided the following provinces:

**''Liguria'' (today's [[Liguria]] and western [[Piedmont]])
** ''Transpadana'' (eastern Piedmont and [[Lombardy]])
** ''Rhaetia'' (eastern [[Switzerland]], western and central [[Austria]] and part of southern [[Germany]])
** ''Venetia et Histria'' (today's [[Veneto]], [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] and [[Trentino-Alto Adige]] and [[Istria County|Istria county]])
** ''Aemilia'' ([[Emilia-Romagna]])
** ''Tuscia'' ([[Etruria]]) ''et Umbria'' ([[Tuscany]] and [[Umbria]])
** ''Flaminia'' ([[Picenum]] and the former [[Ager Gallicus]], in today's [[Marche]])	
** ''Latium et Campania'' (the coastal parts of [[Lazio]] and [[Campania]]) 
** ''Samnium'' ([[Abruzzo]], [[Molise]] and [[Irpinia]])
** ''Apulia et Calabria'' (today's [[Apulia]])
** ''Lucania et Bruttium'' ([[Basilicata]] and [[Calabria]])
** ''Sicilia'' ([[Sicily]] and [[Malta]])
** ''[[Corsica and Sardinia|Corsica et Sardinia]]''

[[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] subdivided the empire into four [[Praetorian prefecture]]s. The ''Diocesis Italiciana'' became the [[Praetorian prefecture of Italy]] (''praefectura praetoria Italiae''), and was subdivided into two dioceses. It still included [[Raetia]]. The two dioceses and their provinces were:

'''Diocesis Italia annonaria''' (Italy of the annona - its inhabitants had to provide the administration in Milan and the troops stationed in that city the [[Cura Annonae|annona]] - food, wine and timber).{{clarify|date=July 2017}}

**''Alpes Cottiae'' (modern [[Liguria]] and western part of [[Piedmont]])
** ''Liguria'' (western [[Lombardy]] and eastern part of Piedmont)
** ''Venetia et Histria'' ([[Istria]] [which is now part of [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]] and Italy], [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], [[Trentino-Alto Adige]], [[Veneto]] and eastern and central Lombardy)
** ''Raetia I'' (eastern Switzerland and western Austria)
** ''Rhaetia II'' (central Austria and part of southern Germany) 
** ''Aemilia'' (the Emilia part of [[Emilia-Romagna]])
** ''Flaminia et Picenum Annonarium'' ([[Romagna]] and northern [[Marche]])

''' Diocesis Italia Suburbicaria''' (Italy "under the government of the ''[[wikt:urbs|urbs]]''", i.e. Rome)

** ''Tuscia'' ([[Etruria]]) ''et Umbria'' ([[Tuscany]], [[Umbria]] and the northern part of coastal [[Lazio]])
** ''Picenum suburbicarium'' ([[Ascoli Piceno|Piceno]], in southern [[Marche]])
** ''Valeria'' [[Sabina (region)|Sabina]] (the modern [[province of Rieti]], other areas of Lazio and areas of [[Umbria]] and [[Abruzzo]])
** ''Campania'' (central and southern coastal [[Lazio]] and coastal [[Campania]] except for the modern [[province of Salerno]])
** ''Samnium'' ([[Abruzzo]], [[Molise]] and the mountain areas of modern Campania; i.e., the modern provinces of [[Province of Benevento|Benevento]] and [[Province of Avellino|Avellino]] and part of the [[province of Caserta]])
** ''Apulia et Calabria'' (today's [[Apulia]])
** ''Lucania et Bruttium (''modern [[Calabria]], [[Basilicata]] and the [[province of Salerno]] in modern Campania)
** ''Sicilia'' ([[Sicily]] and [[Malta]])
** ''[[Sardinia]]''
** ''[[Corsica]]''

===Western Roman Empire===

In 330, [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] inaugurated [[Constantinople]]. He established the imperial court, a Senate, financial and judicial administrations, as well as the military structures. The new city, however, did not receive an urban prefect until 359 which raised it to the status of eastern capital. After the death of [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] in 395 and the subsequent division of the empire Italy was part of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. As a result of Alaric's invasion in 402 the western seat was moved from [[Mediolanum]] to [[Ravenna]]. [[Alaric I|Alaric]], king of [[Visigoth]]s, sacked Rome itself in 410; something that hadn't happened for eight centuries. Northern Italy was attacked by [[Attila]]'s [[Huns]] in 452. Rome was sacked in 455  again by the [[Vandals]] under the command of [[Genseric]]. [[File:Praetorian Prefectures of the Roman Empire 395 AD.png|thumb|right|300px| The "Praetorian Prefecture of Italy" (in yellow) stretched from the Danube river to North Africa]]

According to ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'', one of the very few surviving documents of Roman government updated to the 420s, Roman Italy was governed by a [[praetorian prefect]], ''[[Praetorian prefecture of Italy|Prefectus praetorio Italiae]]'' (who also governed the [[Diocese of Africa]] and the [[Diocese of Pannonia]]), one ''[[vicarius]]'', and one ''[[comes rei militaris]]''. The regions of Italy were governed at the end of the fourth century by eight ''[[Consularis|consulares]]'' (''Venetiae et Histriae'', ''Aemiliae'', ''Liguriae'', ''Flaminiae et Piceni annonarii'', ''Tusciae et Umbriae'', ''Piceni suburbicarii'', ''Campaniae'', and ''Siciliae''), two ''[[corrector]]es'' (''Apuliae et Calabriae'' and ''Lucaniae et Bruttiorum'') and seven ''[[Praeses|praesides]]'' (''Alpium Cottiarum'', ''Rhaetia Prima'' and ''Secunda'', ''Samnii'', ''Valeriae'', ''Sardiniae'', and ''Corsicae''). In the fifth century, with the Emperors controlled by their barbarian generals, the Western imperial government maintained weak control over Italy, whose coasts were periodically under attack. In 476, with the abdication of [[Romulus Augustulus]], the [[Western Roman Empire]] had formally fallen unless one considers Julius Nepos, the legitimate emperor recognized by Constantinople as the last. He was assassinated in 480He may have been recognized by Odoacer. Italy remained under [[Odoacer]] and his [[Odoacer#King of Italy|Kingdom of Italy]], and then under the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]]. The Germanic successor states under [[Odoacer]] and [[Theodoric the Great]] continued to use the Roman administrative machinery, as well as being nominal subjects of the [[Byzantine Emperor|Eastern emperor]] at [[Constantinople]]. In 535 [[Byzantine emperor|Roman Emperor]] [[Justinian]] invaded Italy which suffered twenty years of disastrous war. In August 554, Justinian issued a [[Pragmatic sanction]] which maintained most of the organization of [[Diocletian]]. The "Prefecture of Italy" thus survived, and came under Roman control in the course of [[Justinian]]'s [[Gothic War (535–552)|Gothic War]].
As a result of the Lombard invasion in 568, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] lost most of Italy, except the territories of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] - a corridor from Venice to Lazio - and footholds in the south Naples and the toe and heel of the peninsula.
