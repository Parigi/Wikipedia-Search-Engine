:''Note that some of the article chains listed here have changed since they were added to this page.''
{{humor}}

There is a popular hypothesis, known as ''[[six degrees of separation]]'', holding that any two people are separated by a chain of no more than six acquaintances. Studying the characters of [[Wikipedia]] to see whether something similar obtains among its articles, Six Degrees of Wikipedia aims to be a compendium of the following things:
* The items separated by the ''longest'' minimal chains in the encyclopædia (especially where these are more than four links long). The shortest known chain between the two items should be specified. Generalisation over time, where possible, seems to produce the shortest chains. Failing this, try generalisation over space to reduce chain length.{{clarify|date=September 2010}}
* The most intuitively remote items separated by ''short'' chains—chains of fewer than six articles, anyway.  That is, these should be items that have no obvious connection but which, nonetheless, can be linked between very quickly in Wikipedia. This is a much more subjective category, but should still be interesting; it may be enough to describe these as "interestingly" or "oddly" short chains.
* Chains between two articles selected at random (using [[Special:Randompage]]). Since these can often be uninteresting, think twice about actually adding these to this page.

==Rules==

We will accept only links between actual articles, '''not''' "Talk" pages. (If this approach still allows many uninteresting connections, it might be worth restricting it in further ways, such as disallowing articles on years or decades completely, or any other type of article that might be considered "too general". For now, though, we will not worry about these.)

Be sure to specify the direction the chain runs in by using, for example, the right-arrow character (→), which can be found below the "edit window" when editing pages. If you cannot use the arrow character, you can just use the word "to".

Using date-to-date links (e.g., [[1996]] → [[1993]]) is "uninteresting" and should be avoided. Similarly, using country-to-country links (e.g., [[Japan]] → [[China]]) is uninteresting and should be avoided as well.

Tampering with articles for the sole reason of changing their degrees of separation is discouraged for the purposes of this project; we aim to clarify how Wikipedia is as it evolves, not to set forth that it should be more or less so.  That being said, if this page brings to your attention a "missing link" that really should be in an article, feel free to correct it (and make the corresponding change to this page, as well).&lt;!--
Minimal paths between articles, based on a particular snapshot of the Wikipedia database, can be found using Stephen Dolan's [http://www.netsoc.tcd.ie/~mu/wiki/ Six Degrees of Wikipedia] page.
--&gt;&lt;!--Hmm... doesn't seem to work--&gt;

==Other versions==

Popular versions of this game include [http://www.thewikigame.com The Wiki Game]

[http://www.thewikigame.com The Wiki Game] Is a Real-time and multi-player version, and contains different game type challenges that include random start and end goals.
[http://www.wikipediamaze.com Wikipedia Maze]{{Dead link|date=January 2018}} awards points and badges for both creating and solving puzzles. Each time a user solves a puzzle they are awarded points based on the average amount of clicks it has taken. The harder the puzzle, the more points are awarded. Each puzzle can be voted "up" or "down" by other players, based on whether or not they like it, which results in points being given to or taken from the creator of the puzzle.  Players are also awarded badges when reaching certain point-total milestones.
