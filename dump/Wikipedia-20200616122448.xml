[[File:Solar cell.png|thumb|A conventional [[crystalline silicon]] solar cell (as of 2005). Electrical contacts made from [[busbar]]s (the larger silver-colored strips) and fingers (the smaller ones) are printed on the [[silicon]] [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]].]]
[[File:Photovoltaic cell.svg|thumb|Symbol of a Photovoltaic cell.]]
A '''solar cell''', or '''photovoltaic cell''', is an electrical device that converts the energy of [[light]] directly into [[electricity]] by the [[photovoltaic effect]], which is a [[physics|physical]] and [[Chemical substance|chemical]] phenomenon.&lt;ref name="chemistryexplained.com"&gt;[http://www.chemistryexplained.com/Ru-Sp/Solar-Cells.html Solar Cells]. chemistryexplained.com&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of photoelectric cell, defined as a device whose electrical characteristics, such as [[Electric current|current]], [[voltage]], or [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]], vary when exposed to light. Individual solar cell devices can be combined to form modules, otherwise known as [[solar panel]]s. The common single junction [[silicon]] solar cell can produce a maximum open-circuit voltage of approximately 0.5 to 0.6 volts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solarbotics.net/starting/200202_solar_cells/200202_solar_cell_use.html|title=Solar cells – performance and use|website=solarbotic s.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar cells are described as being [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]], irrespective of whether the source is [[sunlight]] or an artificial light. In addition to producing energy, they can be used as a [[photodetector]] (for example [[infrared detector]]s), detecting light or other [[electromagnetic radiation]] near the visible range, or measuring light intensity.

The operation of a photovoltaic (PV) cell requires three basic attributes:
* The absorption of light, generating either [[electron]]-[[Electron hole|hole]] pairs or [[exciton]]s.
* The separation of [[charge carrier]]s of opposite types.
* The separate extraction of those carriers to an external circuit.

In contrast, a [[solar thermal collector]] supplies [[heat]] by [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbing sunlight]], for the purpose of either direct heating or indirect [[electrical power generation]] from heat. A "photoelectrolytic cell" ([[photoelectrochemical cell]]), on the other hand, refers either to a type of photovoltaic cell (like that developed by [[Edmond Becquerel]] and modern [[dye-sensitized solar cell]]s), or to a device that [[Water splitting|splits water]] directly into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] using only solar illumination.

== Applications ==
[[File:From a solar cell to a PV system.svg|thumb|From a solar cell to a PV system. Diagram of the possible components of a [[photovoltaic system]]]]

Assemblies of solar cells are used to make [[Solar panel|solar modules]] that generate electrical power from [[sunlight]], as distinguished from a "solar thermal module" or "solar hot water panel". A solar array generates [[solar power]] using [[solar energy]].

=== Cells, modules, panels and systems ===
{{Main|Photovoltaic system}}
Multiple solar cells in an integrated group, all oriented in one plane, constitute a [[Solar panel|solar photovoltaic panel or module]]. Photovoltaic modules often have a sheet of glass on the sun-facing side, allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]]. Solar cells are usually connected in [[series and parallel circuits]] or series in modules, creating an additive voltage. Connecting cells in parallel yields a higher current; however, problems such as shadow effects can shut down the weaker (less illuminated) parallel string (a number of series connected cells) causing substantial power loss and possible damage because of the reverse bias applied to the shadowed cells by their illuminated partners. Strings of series cells are usually handled independently and not connected in parallel, though as of 2014, individual [[Electric power conversion|power boxes]] are often supplied for each module, and are connected in parallel. Although modules can be interconnected to create an array with the desired peak DC voltage and loading current capacity, using independent MPPTs ([[Maximum power point tracking|maximum power point trackers]]) is preferable. Otherwise, shunt [[diode]]s can reduce shadowing power loss in arrays with series/parallel connected cells.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

== History ==
{{Main|Timeline of solar cells}}
The [[photovoltaic effect]] was experimentally demonstrated first by French physicist [[Edmond Becquerel]]. In 1839, at age 19, he built the world's first photovoltaic cell in his father's laboratory. [[Willoughby Smith]] first described the "Effect of Light on Selenium during the passage of an Electric Current" in a 20 February 1873 issue of [[Nature (magazine)|Nature]]. In 1883 [[Charles Fritts]] built the first [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] photovoltaic cell by coating the [[semiconductor]] [[selenium]] with a thin layer of [[gold]] to form the junctions; the device was only around 1% efficient. Other milestones include:
* 1888 – Russian physicist [[Aleksandr Stoletov]] built the first cell based on the outer [[photoelectric effect]] discovered by [[Heinrich Hertz]] in 1887.&lt;ref name="Gevorkian2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gevorkian |first=Peter |title=Sustainable energy systems engineering: the complete green building design resource|url={{google books|id=i8rcHsOfPScC|p=498|plainurl=y}}|year=2007|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-147359-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1905 – [[Albert Einstein]] proposed a new quantum theory of light and explained the [[photoelectric effect]] in a landmark paper, for which he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/ "The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921: Albert Einstein"], Nobel Prize official page&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1941 – [[Vadim Lashkaryov]] discovered ''p''-''n''-junctions in [[Copper(I) oxide|Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] and [[Silver sulfide|Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] protocells.&lt;ref&gt;Lashkaryov, V.

* 1954 – The first practical photovoltaic cell was publicly demonstrated at [[Bell Laboratories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=April 25, 1954: Bell Labs Demonstrates the First Practical Silicon Solar Cell |journal=APS News |volume=18 |issue=4 |date=April 2009 |publisher=American Physical Society |url=http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200904/physicshistory.cfm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The inventors were [[Calvin Souther Fuller]], [[Daryl Chapin]] and [[Gerald Pearson]].&lt;ref name="Tsokos2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=K.

* 1958 – Solar cells gained prominence with their incorporation onto the [[Vanguard I]] satellite.

=== Space applications ===
[[File:Explorer 6 paddles up.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[NASA]] used solar cells on its spacecraft from the very beginning. For Example, [[Explorer 6]], launched in 1959, had four arrays that folded out once in orbit. They provided power for months in space.]]
Solar cells were first used in a prominent application when they were proposed and flown on the Vanguard satellite in 1958, as an alternative power source to the [[primary cell|primary battery]] power source. By adding cells to the outside of the body, the mission time could be extended with no major changes to the spacecraft or its power systems. In 1959 the United States launched [[Explorer 6]], featuring large wing-shaped solar arrays, which became a common feature in satellites. These arrays consisted of 9600 [[H. Leslie (Les) Hoffman|Hoffman solar cells]].

By the 1960s, solar cells were (and still are) the main power source for most Earth orbiting satellites and a number of probes into the solar system, since they offered the best [[power-to-weight ratio]]. However, this success was possible because in the space application, power system costs could be high, because space users had few other power options, and were willing to pay for the best possible cells. The space power market drove the development of higher efficiencies in solar cells up until the [[National Science Foundation]] "Research Applied to National Needs" program began to push development of solar cells for terrestrial applications.

In the early 1990s the technology used for space solar cells diverged from the silicon technology used for terrestrial panels, with the spacecraft application shifting to [[gallium arsenide]]-based III-V semiconductor materials, which then evolved into the modern III-V [[multijunction photovoltaic cell]] used on spacecraft.

In recent years, research has moved towards designing and manufacturing lightweight, flexible, and highly efficient solar cells. Terrestrial solar cell technology generally uses photovoltaic cells that are laminated with a layer of glass for strength and protection. Space applications for solar cells require that the cells and arrays are both highly efficient and extremely lightweight. Some newer technology implemented on satellites are multi-junction photovoltaic cells, which are composed of different PN junctions with varying bandgaps in order to utilize a wider spectrum of the sun's energy. Additionally, large satellites require the use of large solar arrays to produce electricity. These solar arrays need to be broken down to fit in the geometric constraints of the launch vehicle the satellite travels on before being injected into orbit. Historically, solar cells on satellites consisted of several small terrestrial panels folded together. These small panels would be unfolded into a large panel after the satellite is deployed in its orbit. Newer satellites aim to use flexible rollable solar arrays that are very lightweight and can be packed into a very small volume. The smaller size and weight of these flexible arrays drastically decreases the overall cost of launching a satellite due to the direct relationship between payload weight and launch cost of a launch vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/solar_arrays.html|title=International Space Station Solar Arrays|last=Garcia|first=Mark|date=31 July 2017|website=NASA|access-date=10 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Price reductions ===
Improvements were gradual over the 1960s. This was also the reason that costs remained high, because space users were willing to pay for the best possible cells, leaving no reason to invest in lower-cost, less-efficient solutions. The price was determined largely by the [[semiconductor industry]]; their move to [[integrated circuit]]s in the 1960s led to the availability of larger [[Boule (crystal)|boules]] at lower relative prices. As their price fell, the price of the resulting cells did as well. These effects lowered 1971 cell costs to some $100 per watt.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p= 50}}

In late 1969 Elliot Berman joined [[Exxon]]'s task force which was looking for projects 30 years in the future and in April 1973 he founded Solar Power Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon at that time.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p=53}}&lt;ref name="williams 2005"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The group had concluded that electrical power would be much more expensive by 2000, and felt that this increase in price would make alternative energy sources more attractive. He conducted a market study and concluded that a [[price per watt]] of about $20/watt would create significant demand.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p=53}} The team eliminated the steps of polishing the wafers and coating them with an anti-reflective layer, relying on the rough-sawn wafer surface. The team also replaced the expensive materials and hand wiring used in space applications with a [[printed circuit board]] on the back, [[acrylate polymer|acrylic]] plastic on the front, and [[silicone]] glue between the two, "potting" the cells.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p=54}} Solar cells could be made using cast-off material from the electronics market. By 1973 they announced a product, and SPC convinced [[Tideland Signal]] to use its panels to power navigational [[buoy]]s, initially for the U.S. Coast Guard.&lt;ref name="williams 2005" /&gt;

=== Research and industrial production ===
Research into solar power for terrestrial applications became prominent with the U.S. National Science Foundation's Advanced Solar Energy Research and Development Division within the "Research Applied to National Needs" program, which ran from 1969 to 1977,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/about/history/nsf50/nsf8816.jsp The National Science Foundation: A Brief History], Chapter IV, NSF 88-16, 15 July 1994 (retrieved 20 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; and funded research on developing solar power for ground electrical power systems. A 1973 conference, the "Cherry Hill Conference", set forth the technology goals required to achieve this goal and outlined an ambitious project for achieving them, kicking off an applied research program that would be ongoing for several decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herwig, Lloyd O.|title=AIP Conference Proceedings|journal=National Center for Photovoltaics (NCPV) 15th Program Review Meeting. AIP Conference Proceedings |volume=462 |page=785 |doi=10.1063/1.58015 |bibcode=1999AIPC..462..785H |chapter=Cherry Hill revisited: Background events and photovoltaic technology status|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was eventually taken over by the [[Energy Research and Development Administration]] (ERDA),&lt;ref&gt;Deyo, J. N., Brandhorst, H. W., Jr., and Forestieri, A. F., [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19770006594 Status of the ERDA/NASA photovoltaic tests and applications project], 12th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conf., 15–18 Nov 1976&lt;/ref&gt; which was later merged into the [[U.S. Department of Energy]].

Following the [[1973 oil crisis]], oil companies used their higher profits to start (or buy) solar firms, and were for decades the largest producers. Exxon, ARCO, Shell, Amoco (later purchased by BP) and Mobil all had major solar divisions during the 1970s and 1980s. Technology companies also participated, including General Electric, Motorola, IBM, Tyco and RCA.&lt;ref name="Information1979"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reed Business Information|title=The multinational connections-who does what where|journal=New Scientist|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=x3w5ZfGUS_0C}}|date=18 October 1979 |publisher=Reed Business Information|issn=0262-4079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjusting for inflation, it cost $96 per watt for a solar module in the mid-1970s. Process improvements and a very large boost in production have brought that figure down 99%, to 68¢ per watt in 2016, according to data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.&lt;ref&gt;Buhayar, Noah (28 January 2016) [https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-solar-power-buffett-vs-musk/ Warren Buffett controls Nevada’s legacy utility. Elon Musk is behind the solar company that’s upending the market. Let the fun begin.] ''Bloomberg Businessweek''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Swanson's law]] is an observation similar to [[Moore's Law]] that states that solar cell prices fall 20% for every doubling of industry capacity. It was featured in an article in the British weekly newspaper [[The Economist]] in late 2012.&lt;ref name="Econ1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/21566414-alternative-energy-will-no-longer-be-alternative-sunny-uplands| title =Sunny Uplands: Alternative energy will no longer be alternative| work=The Economist| accessdate = 28 December 2012| date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further improvements reduced production cost to under $1 per watt, with wholesale costs well under $2. [[Balance of system]] costs were then higher than those of the panels. Large commercial arrays could be built, as of 2010, at below $3.40 a watt, fully commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;$1/W Photovoltaic Systems DOE whitepaper August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="247wallst.com"&gt;[http://247wallst.com/2011/10/06/solar-stocks-does-the-punishment-fit-the-crime-fslr-spwra-stp-jaso-tsl-ldk-tan/ Solar Stocks: Does the Punishment Fit the Crime?]. 24/7 Wall St. (6 October 2011). Retrieved 3 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the semiconductor industry moved to ever-larger [[Boule (crystal)|boules]], older equipment became inexpensive. Cell sizes grew as equipment became available on the surplus market; [[ARCO]] Solar's original panels used cells {{convert|2|to|4|in|mm|-1}} in diameter. Panels in the 1990s and early 2000s generally used 125&amp;nbsp;mm wafers; since 2008, almost all new panels use 156&amp;nbsp;mm cells. The widespread introduction of [[flat screen television]]s in the late 1990s and early 2000s led to the wide availability of large, high-quality glass sheets to cover the panels.

During the 1990s, [[polysilicon]] ("poly") cells became increasingly popular. These cells offer less efficiency than their monosilicon ("mono") counterparts, but they are grown in large vats that reduce cost. By the mid-2000s, poly was dominant in the low-cost panel market, but more recently the mono returned to widespread use.

Manufacturers of wafer-based cells responded to high silicon prices in 2004–2008 with rapid reductions in silicon consumption. In 2008, according to Jef Poortmans, director of [[IMEC]]'s organic and solar department, current cells use {{convert|8|-|9|g|oz}} of silicon per watt of power generation, with wafer thicknesses in the neighborhood of 200&amp;nbsp;[[microns]].  [[Crystalline silicon]] panels dominate worldwide markets and are mostly manufactured in China and Taiwan. By late 2011, a drop in European demand dropped prices for crystalline solar modules to about $1.09&lt;ref name="247wallst.com"/&gt; per watt down sharply from 2010. Prices continued to fall in 2012, reaching $0.62/watt by 4Q2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Parkinson|first=Giles |title=Plunging Cost of Solar PV (Graphs) |url=http://cleantechnica.com/2013/03/07/plunging-cost-of-solar-pv-graphs/ |publisher=Clean Technica |accessdate=18 May 2013|date=7 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsidies and grid parity===

Solar-specific [[feed-in tariff]]s vary by country and within countries. Such tariffs encourage the development of solar power projects.
Widespread [[grid parity]], the point at which photovoltaic electricity is equal to or cheaper than [[Mains electricity|grid power]] without subsidies, likely requires advances on all three fronts. Proponents of solar hope to achieve grid parity first in areas with abundant sun and high electricity costs such as in [[California]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=9013609&amp;contentId=7005395 |title=BP Global&amp;nbsp;– Reports and publications&amp;nbsp;– Going for grid parity |accessdate=4 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608081013/http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=9013609&amp;contentId=7005395 |archivedate=8 June 2011  }}.

The price of solar panels fell steadily for 40 years, interrupted in 2004 when high subsidies in Germany drastically increased demand there and greatly increased the price of purified silicon (which is used in computer chips as well as solar panels). The [[2008–2012 global recession|recession of 2008]] and the onset of Chinese manufacturing caused prices to resume their decline. In the four years after January 2008 prices for solar modules in Germany dropped from €3 to €1 per peak watt. During that same time production capacity surged with an annual growth of more than 50%. China increased market share from 8% in 2008 to over 55% in the last quarter of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Sam (20 April 2011) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130512121859/http://energy.colostate.edu/docs/BaldwinTalkColoradoStateUniversity2011-04-20final.pdf Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy: Challenges and Opportunities].

[[File:Silicon Solar cell structure and mechanism.svg|thumb|220px|Working [[Theory of solar cells|mechanism]] of a solar cell]]
{{Main|Theory of solar cells}}
The solar cell works in several steps:
* [[Photon]]s in [[sunlight]] hit the solar panel and are absorbed by [[List of semiconductor materials|semiconducting materials]], such as doped [[silicon]].
* [[Electrons]] are [[Excited state|excited]] from their current [[Molecular orbital|molecular]]/[[Atomic orbital|atomic orbita]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l. Once excited an electron can either dissipate the energy as heat and [[Relaxation (physics)|return to its orbital]] or travel through the cell until it reaches an electrode. Current flows through the material to cancel the potential and this electricity is captured. The [[chemical bonds]] of the material are vital for this process to work, and usually [[silicon]] is used in two layers, one layer being [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] with [[boron]], the other [[phosphorus]]. These layers have different chemical electric charges and subsequently both drive and direct the current of electrons.&lt;ref name="chemistryexplained.com"/&gt;
* An array of solar cells converts solar energy into a usable amount of [[direct current]] (DC) electricity.
* An [[inverter]] can convert the power to [[alternating current]] (AC).

The most commonly known solar cell is configured as a large-area [[p–n junction]] made from silicon. Other possible solar cell types are organic solar cells, dye sensitized solar cells, perovskite solar cells, quantum dot solar cells etc. The illuminated side of a solar cell generally has a [[transparent conducting film]] for allowing light to enter into active material and to collect the generated charge carriers. Typically, films with high transmittance and high electrical conductance such as [[indium tin oxide]], conducting polymers or conducting nanowire networks are used for the purpose.&lt;ref name=kumar2017&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Ankush|date=3 January 2017|title=Predicting efficiency of solar cells based on transparent conducting electrodes|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=121|issue=1|pages=014502|doi=10.1063/1.4973117|issn=0021-8979|bibcode=2017JAP...121a4502K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efficiency ==
[[File:ShockleyQueisserFullCurve.svg|thumb|The [[Shockley-Queisser limit]] for the theoretical maximum efficiency of a solar cell. Semiconductors with [[band gap]] between 1 and 1.5[[Electronvolt|eV]], or near-infrared light, have the greatest potential to form an efficient single-junction cell. (The efficiency "limit" shown here can be exceeded by [[multijunction solar cell]]s.)]]
{{Main|Solar cell efficiency}}
Solar cell efficiency may be broken down into reflectance efficiency, thermodynamic efficiency, charge carrier separation efficiency and conductive efficiency. The overall efficiency is the product of these individual metrics.

The [[Energy conversion efficiency|power conversion efficiency]] of a solar cell is a parameter which is defined by the fraction of incident power converted into electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/solar-cell-efficiency|title=Solar Cell Efficiency {{!}} PVEducation|website=www.pveducation.org|access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A solar cell has a voltage dependent efficiency curve, temperature coefficients, and allowable shadow angles.

Due to the difficulty in measuring these parameters directly, other parameters are substituted: thermodynamic efficiency, [[Quantum efficiency of a solar cell|quantum efficiency]], [[Quantum efficiency|integrated quantum efficiency]], [[Open-circuit voltage|V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;]] ratio, and fill factor. Reflectance losses are a portion of quantum efficiency under "[[Quantum efficiency#Types of quantum efficiency|external quantum efficiency]]". Recombination losses make up another portion of quantum efficiency, V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; ratio, and fill factor. Resistive losses are predominantly categorized under fill factor, but also make up minor portions of quantum efficiency, V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; ratio.

The [[Solar cell efficiency#Fill factor|fill factor]] is the ratio of the actual maximum obtainable [[power (physics)|power]] to the product of the [[open circuit voltage]] and [[short circuit current]]. This is a key parameter in evaluating performance. In 2009, typical commercial solar cells had a fill factor &gt; 0.70. Grade B cells were usually between 0.4 and 0.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=T.Bazouni: What is the Fill Factor of a Solar Panel| url=http://www.solarfreaks.com/what-is-the-fill-factor-of-a-solar-panel-t138.html| accessdate=17 February 2009| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415162123/http://www.solarfreaks.com/what-is-the-fill-factor-of-a-solar-panel-t138.html| archivedate=15 April 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cells with a high fill factor have a low [[equivalent series resistance]] and a high [[Shunt (electrical)|equivalent shunt resistance]], so less of the current produced by the cell is dissipated in internal losses.

Single p–n junction crystalline silicon devices are now approaching the theoretical limiting power efficiency of 33.16%,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Tabulated Values of the Shockley-Queisser Limit for Single Junction Solar Cells |journal = Solar Energy|date = 8 February 2016|pages = 139–147|volume = 130|doi = 10.1016/j.solener.2016.02.015 |first = Sven|last = Rühle|bibcode = 2016SoEn..130..139R}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted as the [[Shockley–Queisser limit]] in 1961.

In 2014, three companies broke the record of 25.6% for a silicon solar cell. Panasonic's was the most efficient. The company moved the front contacts to the rear of the panel, eliminating shaded areas. In addition they applied thin silicon films to the (high quality silicon) wafer's front and back to eliminate defects at or near the wafer surface.&lt;ref&gt;Bullis, Kevin (13 June 2014) [http://www.technologyreview.com/news/528351/record-breaking-solar-cell-points-the-way-to-cheaper-power Record-Breaking Solar Cell Points the Way to Cheaper Power].

[[File:Global Market Share by PV Technology from 1990 to 2013.svg|thumb|260px|Global market-share in terms of annual production by PV technology since 1990]]

Solar cells are typically named after the [[semiconducting material]] they are made of. These [[List of semiconductor materials|materials]] must have certain characteristics in order to absorb [[sunlight]]. Some cells are designed to handle sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, while others are optimized for [[Solar panels on spacecraft|use in space]]. Solar cells can be made of only one single layer of light-absorbing material ([[p-n junction|single-junction]]) or use multiple physical configurations ([[multi-junction]]s) to take advantage of various absorption and charge separation mechanisms.

Solar cells can be classified into first, second and third generation cells. The first generation cells—also called conventional, traditional or [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]-based cells—are made of [[crystalline silicon]], the commercially predominant PV technology, that includes materials such as [[polysilicon]] and [[monocrystalline silicon]]. Second generation cells are [[thin film solar cells]], that include [[amorphous silicon]], [[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|CdTe]] and [[Copper indium gallium selenide solar cell|CIGS]] cells and are commercially significant in utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station]]s, [[building integrated photovoltaics]] or in small [[stand-alone power system]]. The [[third-generation photovoltaic cell|third generation of solar cells]] includes a number of thin-film technologies often described as emerging photovoltaics—most of them have not yet been commercially applied and are still in the research or development phase. Many use organic materials, often [[organometallic]] compounds as well as inorganic substances. Despite the fact that their efficiencies had been low and the stability of the absorber material was often too short for commercial applications, there is a lot of research invested into these technologies as they promise to achieve the goal of producing low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.

=== Crystalline silicon ===
{{Main|Crystalline silicon}}
By far, the most prevalent bulk material for solar cells is [[crystalline silicon]] (c-Si), also known as "solar grade silicon".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Bulk silicon is separated into multiple categories according to crystallinity and crystal size in the resulting [[ingot]], [[ribbon]] or [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]. These cells are entirely based around the concept of a [[p-n junction]].
Solar cells made of c-Si are made from [[wafer (electronics)|wafers]] between 160 and 240&amp;nbsp;micrometers thick.

==== Monocrystalline silicon ====
{{Main|Monocrystalline silicon}}
[[File:Sono Sion Front Back.jpg|thumb|The roof, bonnet and large parts of the outer shell of the [[Sion (electric car)|Sion]] are equipped with highly efficient monocrystalline silicon cells]]

[[Monocrystalline silicon]] (mono-Si) solar cells are more efficient and more expensive than most other types of cells. The corners of the cells look clipped, like an octagon, because the wafer material is cut from cylindrical ingots, that are typically grown by the [[Czochralski process]]. Solar panels using mono-Si cells display a distinctive pattern of small white diamonds.

====Epitaxial silicon development====
[[Epitaxial wafer]]s of crystalline silicon can be grown on a monocrystalline silicon "seed" wafer by [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD), and then detached as self-supporting wafers of some standard thickness (e.g., 250&amp;nbsp;µm) that can be manipulated by hand, and directly substituted for wafer cells cut from monocrystalline silicon ingots. Solar cells made with this "[[Saw#Terminology|kerf]]less" technique can have efficiencies approaching those of wafer-cut cells, but at appreciably lower cost if the CVD can be done at [[atmospheric pressure]] in a high-throughput inline process.&lt;ref name=NexWafe/&gt;&lt;ref name="DrießenAmiri2016"/&gt; The surface of epitaxial wafers may be textured to enhance light absorption.&lt;ref name=pyramid&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b01240 | pmid=27525513 | title=Ultrathin Epitaxial Silicon Solar Cells with Inverted Nanopyramid Arrays for Efficient Light Trapping | first1= Alexandre| last1= Gaucher| first2= Andrea| last2= Cattoni| first3= Christophe| last3= Dupuis| first4= Wanghua| last4= Chen| first5= Romain| last5= Cariou|last6 = Foldyna| first6=Martin | last7=Lalouat | first7=Loı̈c | last8=Drouard | first8=Emmanuel | last9=Seassal | first9=Christian | last10=Roca i Cabarrocas | first10=Pere | last11=Collin | first11=Stéphane | journal= Nano Letters| year= 2016| volume= 16| issue=9 | pages= 5358–64| bibcode=2016NanoL..16.5358G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChenCariou2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Chen | first1=Wanghua | last2=Cariou | first2=Romain | last3=Foldyna | first3=Martin | last4=Depauw | first4=Valerie | last5=Trompoukis | first5=Christos | last6=Drouard | first6=Emmanuel | last7=Lalouat | first7=Loic | last8=Harouri | first8=Abdelmounaim | last9=Liu | first9=Jia | last10=Fave | first10=Alain | last11=Orobtchouk | first11=Régis | last12=Mandorlo | first12=Fabien | last13=Seassal | first13=Christian | last14=Massiot | first14=Inès | last15=Dmitriev | first15=Alexandre | last16=Lee | first16=Ki-Dong | last17=Cabarrocas | first17=Pere Roca i | title=Nanophotonics-based low-temperature PECVD epitaxial crystalline silicon solar cells | journal=Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics | volume=49 | issue=12 | year=2016 | pages=125603 | issn=0022-3727 | doi=10.1088/0022-3727/49/12/125603| bibcode=2016JPhD...49l5603C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Polycrystalline silicon ====
{{Main|Polycrystalline silicon}}
[[Polycrystalline silicon]], or multicrystalline silicon (multi-Si) cells are made from cast square ingots—large blocks of molten silicon carefully cooled and solidified. They consist of small crystals giving the material its typical [[Crystallite|metal flake effect]]. Polysilicon cells are the most common type used in photovoltaics and are less expensive, but also less efficient, than those made from monocrystalline silicon.

==== Ribbon silicon ====
[[Ribbon silicon]] is a type of polycrystalline silicon—it is formed by drawing flat thin films from [[molten]] silicon and results in a polycrystalline structure. These cells are cheaper to make than multi-Si, due to a great reduction in silicon waste, as this approach does not require [[saw]]ing from [[ingot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ece.gatech.edu/research/UCEP/papers/3world/STRING%20RIBBON%20SILICON%20SOLAR%20CELLS%20WITH%2017.8%25%20EFFICIENCY.pdf|title=String ribbon silicon solar cells with 17.8% efficiency|author=Kim, D.S.|journal=Proceedings of 3rd World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion, 2003|date=18 May 2003|pages= 1293–1296|volume=2|isbn=978-4-9901816-0-4

==== Mono-like-multi silicon (MLM) ====
This form was developed in the 2000s and introduced commercially around 2009. Also called cast-mono, this design uses polycrystalline casting chambers with small "seeds" of mono material. The result is a bulk mono-like material that is polycrystalline around the outsides. When sliced for processing, the inner sections are high-efficiency mono-like cells (but square instead of "clipped"), while the outer edges are sold as conventional poly. This production method results in mono-like cells at poly-like prices.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne McMillan, [http://btimaging.com/Downloads/bt_PV_eng-Advertorial3_Final.pdf "The Cast Mono Dilemma"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105134839/http://www.btimaging.com/downloads/bt_pv_eng-advertorial3_final.pdf |date=5 November 2013 }}, BT Imaging&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thin film ===
{{Main|Thin-film solar cell}}
Thin-film technologies reduce the amount of active material in a cell. Most designs sandwich active material between two panes of glass. Since silicon solar panels only use one pane of glass, thin film panels are approximately twice as heavy as crystalline silicon panels, although they have a smaller ecological impact (determined from [[life cycle analysis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| doi = 10.1115/SED2002-1051| chapter = Net Energy Analysis for Sustainable Energy Production from Silicon Based Solar Cells| title = Solar Energy| page = 181| year = 2002| last1 = Pearce| first1 = J.| last2 = Lau| first2 = A.| isbn = 978-0-7918-1689-9| chapter-url = http://www.cede.psu.edu/users/alau/ases02_net_energy_pv.pdf}}{{dead link|date=May 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- The majority of film panels have 2–3 percentage points lower conversion efficiencies than crystalline silicon.&lt;ref&gt;Datasheets of the market leaders: ''First Solar'' for thin film, ''Suntech'' and ''SunPower'' for crystalline silicon&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cadmium telluride]] (CdTe), [[copper indium gallium selenide]] (CIGS) and [[amorphous silicon]] (a-Si) are three thin-film technologies often used for outdoor applications. As of December 2013, CdTe cost per installed watt was $0.59 as reported by First Solar. CIGS technology laboratory demonstrations reached 20.4% conversion efficiency as of December 2013. The lab efficiency of GaAs thin film technology topped 28%.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} The [[quantum efficiency]] of thin film solar cells is also lower due to reduced number of collected charge carriers per incident photon. Most recently, CZTS solar cell emerge as the less-toxic thin film solar cell technology, which achieved ~12% efficiency. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Thin Film Solar Cells: Research in an Industrial Perspective|journal = AMBIO|date = March 2012|issn = 0044-7447|pmc = 3357764|pmid = 22434436|pages = 112–118|volume = 41|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s13280-012-0265-6|first = Marika|last = Edoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cadmium telluride ====
{{Main|Cadmium telluride photovoltaics}}
Cadmium telluride is the only thin film material so far to rival crystalline silicon in cost/watt. However cadmium is highly toxic and [[tellurium]] ([[anion]]: "telluride") supplies are limited. The [[cadmium]] present in the cells would be toxic if released. However, release is impossible during normal operation of the cells and is unlikely during fires in residential roofs.&lt;ref name="Fthenakis 303–334"&gt;{{Cite journal

==== Copper indium gallium selenide ====
{{Main|Copper indium gallium selenide solar cell}}
Copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) is a [[Direct and indirect band gaps|direct band gap]] material. It has the highest efficiency (~20%) among all commercially significant thin film materials (see [[Copper indium gallium selenide solar cell|CIGS solar cell]]). Traditional methods of fabrication involve vacuum processes including co-evaporation and sputtering. Recent developments at [[IBM]] and [[Nanosolar]] attempt to lower the cost by using non-vacuum solution processes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/24464.wss "IBM and Tokyo Ohka Kogyo Turn Up Watts on Solar Energy Production"], IBM&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Silicon thin film ====
[[Silicon thin-film cell]]s are mainly deposited by [[chemical vapor deposition]] (typically plasma-enhanced, PE-CVD) from [[silane]] gas and [[hydrogen]] gas. Depending on the deposition parameters, this can yield [[amorphous silicon]] (a-Si or a-Si:H), [[protocrystalline]] silicon or [[nanocrystalline silicon]] (nc-Si or nc-Si:H), also called microcrystalline silicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0927-0248(02)00436-1| title = Evolution of microstructure and phase in amorphous, protocrystalline, and microcrystalline silicon studied by real time spectroscopic ellipsometry| journal = Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells| volume = 78| issue = 1–4| page = 143| year = 2003| last1 = Collins | first1 = R.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amorphous silicon is the most well-developed thin film technology to-date. An amorphous silicon (a-Si) solar cell is made of non-crystalline or microcrystalline silicon. Amorphous silicon has a higher bandgap (1.7&amp;nbsp;eV) than crystalline silicon (c-Si) (1.1&amp;nbsp;eV), which means it absorbs the visible part of the solar spectrum more strongly than the higher power density [[infrared]] portion of the spectrum. The production of a-Si thin film solar cells uses glass as a substrate and deposits a very thin layer of silicon by [[plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition]] (PECVD).

Protocrystalline silicon with a low volume fraction of nanocrystalline silicon is optimal for high open circuit voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1063/1.2714507| title = Optimization of open circuit voltage in amorphous silicon solar cells with mixed-phase (amorphous+nanocrystalline) p-type contacts of low nanocrystalline content| journal = Journal of Applied Physics| volume = 101| issue = 11| pages = 114301–114301–7| year = 2007| last1 = Pearce| first1 = J.

The top cell in a-Si absorbs the visible light and leaves the infrared part of the spectrum for the bottom cell in nc-Si.

==== Gallium arsenide thin film ====
The semiconductor material [[Gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) is also used for single-crystalline thin film solar cells. Although GaAs cells are very expensive, they hold the world's record in efficiency for a [[Single-junction cell|single-junction]] solar cell at 28.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1109/PVSC.2012.6317891|chapter=The opto-electronic physics that broke the efficiency limit in solar cells|title=2012 38th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference|year=2012|last1=Yablonovitch|first1=Eli|last2=Miller|first2=Owen D.|last3=Kurtz|first3=S. R.|isbn=978-1-4673-0066-7|page=001556}}&lt;/ref&gt; GaAs is more commonly used in [[multijunction photovoltaic cell]]s for [[concentrated photovoltaics]] (CPV, HCPV) and for [[solar panels on spacecraft]]s, as the industry favours efficiency over cost for [[space-based solar power]]. Based on the previous literature and some theoretical analysis, there are several reasons why GaAs has such high power conversion efficiency. First, GaAs bandgap is 1.43ev which is almost ideal for solar cells. Second, because Gallium is a by-product of the smelting of other metals, GaAs cells are relatively insensitive to heat and it can keep high efficiency when temperature is quite high. Third, GaAs has the wide range of design options. Using GaAs as active layer in solar cell, engineers can have multiple choices of other layers which can better generate electrons and holes in GaAs.

=== Multijunction cells ===
{{Main|Multi-junction solar cell}}
[[File:Dawn solar panel.jpg|thumb|[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'s 10&amp;nbsp;[[Kilowatt|kW]] triple-junction gallium arsenide solar array at full extension]]

Multi-junction cells consist of multiple thin films, each essentially a solar cell grown on top of another, typically using [[metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy]]. Each layer has a different band gap energy to allow it to absorb [[electromagnetic radiation]] over a different portion of the spectrum. Multi-junction cells were originally developed for special applications such as [[satellite]]s and [[space exploration]], but are now used increasingly in terrestrial [[concentrator photovoltaics]] (CPV), an emerging technology that uses lenses and curved mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto small, highly efficient multi-junction solar cells. By concentrating sunlight up to a thousand times, ''High concentrated photovoltaics (HCPV)'' has the potential to outcompete conventional solar PV in the future.&lt;ref name=Fraunhofer-PR-2014&gt;

Additionally, germanium metal prices have risen substantially to $1000–1200 per kg this year. Those materials include gallium (4N, 6N and 7N Ga), arsenic (4N, 6N and 7N) and germanium, pyrolitic boron nitride (pBN) crucibles for growing crystals, and boron oxide, these products are critical to the entire substrate manufacturing industry.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

====GaInP/Si dual-junction solar cells ====
In 2016, a new approach was described for producing hybrid photovoltaic wafers combining the high efficiency of [[Multi-junction solar cell|III-V multi-junction solar cells]] with the economies and wealth of experience associated with silicon. The technical complications involved in growing the III-V material on silicon at the required high temperatures, a subject of study for some 30 years, are avoided by epitaxial growth of silicon on GaAs at low temperature by [[plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition]] (PECVD).&lt;ref name="CariouChen2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cariou|first1=Romain|last2=Chen|first2=Wanghua|last3=Maurice|first3=Jean-Luc|last4=Yu|first4=Jingwen|last5=Patriarche|first5=Gilles|last6=Mauguin|first6=Olivia|last7=Largeau|first7=Ludovic|last8=Decobert|first8=Jean|last9=Roca i Cabarrocas|first9=Pere|title=Low temperature plasma enhanced CVD epitaxial growth of silicon on GaAs: a new paradigm for III-V/Si integration|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|year=2016|pages=25674|issn=2045-2322|doi=10.1038/srep25674|pmid=27166163|pmc=4863370|bibcode=2016NatSR...625674C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Si single-junction solar cells have been widely studied for decades and are reaching their practical efficiency of ~26% under 1-sun conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/JPHOTOV.2014.2350695|title=Toward the Practical Limits of Silicon Solar Cells|journal=IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics|volume=4|issue=6|pages=1465–1469|year=2014|last1=Smith|first1=David D.|last2=Cousins|first2=Peter|last3=Westerberg|first3=Staffan|last4=Jesus-Tabajonda|first4=Russelle De|last5=Aniero|first5=Gerly|last6=Shen|first6=Yu-Chen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing this efficiency may require adding more cells with bandgap energy larger than 1.1 eV to the Si cell, allowing to convert short-wavelength photons for generation of additional voltage. A dual-junction solar cell with a band gap of 1.6–1.8 eV as a top cell can reduce thermalization loss, produce a high external radiative efficiency and achieve theoretical efficiencies over 45%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/JPHOTOV.2015.2395140|title=Supercharging Silicon Solar Cell Performance by Means of Multijunction Concept|journal=IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics|volume=5|issue=3|pages=968–976|year=2015|last1=Almansouri|first1=Ibraheem|last2=Ho-Baillie|first2=Anita|last3=Bremner|first3=Stephen P.|last4=Green|first4=Martin A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tandem cell can be fabricated by growing the GaInP and Si cells. Growing them separately can overcome the 4% lattice constant mismatch between Si and the most common III–V layers that prevent direct integration into one cell. The two cells therefore are separated by a transparent glass slide so the lattice mismatch does not cause strain to the system. This creates a cell with four electrical contacts and two junctions that demonstrated an efficiency of 18.1%. With a ﬁll factor (FF) of 76.2%, the Si bottom cell reaches an efﬁciency of 11.7% (± 0.4) in the tandem device, resulting in a cumulative tandem cell efﬁciency of 29.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1109/JPHOTOV.2016.2549746|url=https://www.osti.gov/pages/servlets/purl/1329999|title=Realization of GaInP/Si Dual-Junction Solar Cells with 29.8% 1-Sun Efficiency|journal=IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics|volume=6|issue=4|pages=1012–1019|year=2016|last1=Essig|first1=Stephanie|last2=Steiner|first2=Myles A.|last3=Allebe|first3=Christophe|last4=Geisz|first4=John F.|last5=Paviet-Salomon|first5=Bertrand|last6=Ward|first6=Scott|last7=Descoeudres|first7=Antoine|last8=Lasalvia|first8=Vincenzo|last9=Barraud|first9=Loris|last10=Badel|first10=Nicolas|last11=Faes|first11=Antonin|last12=Levrat|first12=Jacques|last13=Despeisse|first13=Matthieu|last14=Ballif|first14=Christophe|last15=Stradins|first15=Paul|last16=Young|first16=David L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This efﬁciency exceeds the theoretical limit of 29.4%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/JPHOTOV.2013.2270351|title=Reassessment of the Limiting Efficiency for Crystalline Silicon Solar Cells|journal=IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics|volume=3|issue=4|pages=1184–1191|year=2013|last1=Richter|first1=Armin|last2=Hermle|first2=Martin|last3=Glunz|first3=Stefan W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the record experimental efﬁciency value of a Si 1-sun solar cell, and is also higher than the record-efﬁciency 1-sun GaAs device. However, using a GaAs substrate is expensive and not practical. Hence researchers try to make a cell with two electrical contact points and one junction, which does not need a GaAs substrate. This means there will be direct integration of GaInP and Si.

{{Main|Perovskite solar cell}}
[[Perovskite solar cell]]s are solar cells that include a [[perovskite]]-structured material as the active layer. Most commonly, this is a solution-processed hybrid organic-inorganic tin or lead halide based material. Efficiencies have increased from below 5% at their first usage in 2009 to over 25% in 2019, making them a very rapidly advancing technology and a hot topic in the solar cell field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NREL effiiciency chart|url=http://www.nrel.gov/ncpv/images/efficiency_chart.jpg|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122164942/http://www.nrel.gov/ncpv/images/efficiency_chart.jpg|archivedate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perovskite solar cells are also forecast to be extremely cheap to scale up, making them a very attractive option for commercialisation.

=== Bifacial solar cells ===
[[File:Noto Bifacial Plant.png|thumb|Bifacial solar cell plant in Noto (Senegal), 1988 - Floor painted in white to enhance albedo.]]
With a transparent rear side, bifacial solar cells can absorb light from both the front and rear sides. Hence, they can produce more electricity than conventional monofacial solar cells. The first patent of bifacial solar cells was filed by Japanese researcher Hiroshi Mori, in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=3 October 1961|others=Mori Hiroshi, Hayakawa Denki Kogyo KK|title=Radiation energy transducing device|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US3278811}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it is said that Russia was the first to deploy bifacial solar cells in their space program in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} In 1976, the [http://www.ies.upm.es/ Institute for Solar Energy] of the [[Technical University of Madrid]], began a research program for the development of bifacial solar cells led by [[Antonio Luque López|Prof. Antonio Luque]]. Based on 1977 US and Spanish patents by Luque, a practical bifacial cell was proposed with a front face as anode and a rear face as cathode; in previously reported proposals and attempts both faces were anodic and interconnection between cells was complicated and expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|ES|453575 (A1)|A.

With an initial production capacity of 300&amp;nbsp;kW/yr. of bifacial solar cells, early landmarks of Isofoton's production were the 20kWp power plant in [[San Agustín de Guadalix]], built in 1986 for [[Iberdrola]], and an off grid installation by 1988 also of 20kWp in the village of Noto Gouye Diama ([[Senegal]]) funded by the [[Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation|Spanish international aid and cooperation programs]].

Due to the reduced manufacturing cost, companies have again started to produce commercial bifacial modules since 2010. By 2017, there were at least eight certified PV manufacturers providing bifacial modules in North America. It has been predicted by the International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaics (ITRPV) that the global market share of bifacial technology will expand from less than 5% in 2016 to 30% in 2027.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itrpv.net/|title=International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaic (ITRPV) – Home|website=www.itrpv.net|access-date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sun ''et al.'' also derived a set of empirical equations that can optimize bifacial solar modules analytically.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In addition, there is evidence that bifacial panels work better than traditional panels in snowy environments - as bifacials on dual-axis trackers made 14%t more electricity in a year than their monofacial counterparts and 40% during the peak winter months.&lt;ref&gt;Burnham, Performance of Bifacial Photovoltaic Modules on a Dual-Axis Tracker in a High-Latitude, High-Albedo Environment, 2019 IEEE 46th Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC), Chicago, IL, USA, 2019, pp. 1320-1327.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intermediate Band ===
{{Main|Intermediate band photovoltaics}}

'''Intermediate band photovoltaics''' in solar cell research provides methods for exceeding the [[Shockley–Queisser limit]] on the efficiency of a cell. It introduces an intermediate band (IB) energy level in between the valence and conduction bands. Theoretically, introducing an IB allows two [[photons]] with energy less than the [[bandgap]] to excite an electron from the [[valence band]] to the [[conduction band]]. This increases the induced photocurrent and thereby efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.5014|title=Increasing the Efficiency of Ideal Solar Cells by Photon Induced Transitions at Intermediate Levels|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=78|issue=26|pages=5014–5017|year=1997|last1=Luque|first1=Antonio|last2=Martí|first2=Antonio|bibcode=1997PhRvL..78.5014L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonio Luque López|Luque]] and Marti first derived a theoretical limit for an IB device with one midgap energy level using [[detailed balance]]. They assumed no carriers were collected at the IB and that the device was under full concentration. They found the maximum efficiency to be 63.2%, for a bandgap of 1.95eV with the IB 0.71eV from either the valence or conduction band.
Under one sun illumination the limiting efficiency is 47%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Okada, Yoshitaka, Tomah Sogabe, and Yasushi Shoji|doi=10.1039/9781849739955-00425|isbn= 978-1-84973-995-5|chapter=Ch. 13: Intermediate Band Solar Cells|title= Advanced Concepts in Photovoltaics|editor=Arthur J.

=== Liquid inks ===
In 2014, researchers at [[California NanoSystems Institute]] discovered using [[kesterite]] and [[perovskite]] improved [[electric power conversion]] efficiency for solar cells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2014-09-liquid-inks-solar-cells.html Researchers use liquid inks to create better solar cells], Phys.org, 17 September 2014, Shaun Mason&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Upconversion and downconversion===
[[Photon upconversion]] is the process of using two low-energy (''e.g.'', infrared) photons to produce one higher energy photon; '''downconversion''' is the process of using one high energy photon (''e.g.,'', ultraviolet) to produce two lower energy photons. Either of these techniques could be used to produce higher efficiency solar cells by allowing solar photons to be more efficiently used. The difficulty, however, is that the conversion efficiency of existing [[phosphor]]s exhibiting up- or down-conversion is low, and is typically narrow band.

One upconversion technique is to incorporate [[lanthanide]]-doped materials ([[Erbium|{{chem|Er|3+}}]], [[Ytterbium|{{chem|Yb|3+}}]], [[Holmium|{{chem|Ho|3+}}]] or a combination), taking advantage of their [[luminescence]] to convert [[infrared radiation]] to visible light. Upconversion process occurs when two [[infrared]] photons are absorbed by [[rare-earth]] [[ion]]s to generate a (high-energy) absorbable photon. As example, the energy transfer upconversion process (ETU), consists in successive transfer processes between excited ions in the near infrared. The upconverter material could be placed below the solar cell to absorb the infrared light that passes through the silicon. Useful ions are most commonly found in the trivalent state. {{chem|Er|+}} ions have been the most used. {{chem|Er|3+}} ions absorb solar radiation around 1.54&amp;nbsp;µm. Two {{chem|Er|3+}} ions that have absorbed this radiation can interact with each other through an upconversion process. The excited ion emits light above the Si bandgap that is absorbed by the solar cell and creates an additional electron–hole pair that can generate current. However, the increased efficiency was small. In addition, fluoroindate glasses have low [[phonon]] energy and have been proposed as suitable matrix doped with {{chem|Ho|3+}} ions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hernández-Rodríguez|first=M.A.|author2=Imanieh, M.H. |author3=Martín, L.L. |author4= Martín, I.R. |title=Experimental enhancement of the photocurrent in a solar cell using upconversion process in fluoroindate glasses exciting at 1480nm|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|date=September 2013|volume=116|pages=171–175|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2013.04.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Light-absorbing dyes ===
{{Main|Dye-sensitized solar cell|l1=Dye-sensitized solar cells}}
[[Dye-sensitized solar cell]]s (DSSCs) are made of low-cost materials and do not need elaborate manufacturing equipment, so they can be made in a [[Do it yourself|DIY]] fashion. In bulk it should be significantly less expensive than older [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] cell designs. DSSC's can be engineered into flexible sheets and although its [[conversion efficiency]] is less than the best [[thin film cell]]s, its [[price/performance ratio]] may be high enough to allow them to compete with [[fossil fuel electrical generation]].

Typically a [[ruthenium]] [[Metalorganics|metalorganic]] [[dye]] (Ru-centered) is used as a [[monolayer]] of light-absorbing material. The dye-sensitized solar cell depends on a [[mesoporous]] layer of [[nanoparticulate]] [[titanium dioxide]] to greatly amplify the surface area (200–300 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g {{chem|TiO|2}}, as compared to approximately 10 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g of flat single crystal). The photogenerated electrons from the light absorbing dye are passed on to the n-type {{chem|TiO|2}} and the holes are absorbed by an [[electrolyte]] on the other side of the dye. The circuit is completed by a [[redox]] couple in the electrolyte, which can be liquid or solid. This type of cell allows more flexible use of materials and is typically manufactured by [[screen printing]] or [[ultrasonic nozzle]]s, with the potential for lower processing costs than those used for bulk solar cells. However, the dyes in these cells also suffer from [[chemical decomposition|degradation]] under heat and [[UV]] light and the cell casing is difficult to [[Seal (mechanical)|seal]] due to the solvents used in assembly. The first commercial shipment of DSSC solar modules occurred in July 2009 from G24i Innovations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.g24i.com Dye Sensitized Solar Cells]. G24i.com (2 April 2014). Retrieved 20 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quantum dots ===
{{Main|Quantum dot solar cell}}
[[Quantum dot solar cell]]s (QDSCs) are based on the Gratzel cell, or [[dye-sensitized solar cell]] architecture, but employ low [[band gap]] [[semiconductor]] [[nanoparticle]]s, fabricated with crystallite sizes small enough to form [[quantum dots]] (such as [[cadmium sulfide|CdS]], [[cadmium selenide|CdSe]], [[Stibnite|{{chem|Sb|2|S|3}}]], [[Lead(II) sulfide|PbS]], etc.), instead of organic or organometallic dyes as light absorbers. Due to the toxicity associated with Cd and Pb based compounds there are also a series of "green" QD sensitizing materials in development (such as CuInS&lt;sub href="Refractive index"&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt; CuInSe&lt;sub href="multiple exciton generation"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CuInSeS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1 October 2016|title=Quantum dot sensitized solar cell: Recent advances and future perspectives in photoanode|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|volume=155|pages=294–322|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2016.05.062|issn=0927-0248|last1=Sharma|first1=Darshan|last2=Jha|first2=Ranjana|last3=Kumar|first3=Shiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; QD's size quantization allows for the band gap to be tuned by simply changing particle size. They also have high [[Refractive index|extinction coefficients]] and have shown the possibility of [[multiple exciton generation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1209845|title=Peak External Photocurrent Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 100% via MEG in a Quantum Dot Solar Cell|year=2011|last1=Semonin|first1=O.

In a QDSC, a [[mesoporous]] layer of [[titanium dioxide]] nanoparticles forms the backbone of the cell, much like in a DSSC. This {{chem|TiO|2}} layer can then be made photoactive by coating with semiconductor quantum dots using [[chemical bath deposition]], [[electrophoretic deposition]] or successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction. The electrical circuit is then completed through the use of a liquid or solid [[redox couple]].

=== Organic/polymer solar cells ===
{{Main|Organic solar cell|Polymer solar cell}}
[[Organic solar cell]]s and [[polymer solar cell]]s are built from thin films (typically 100&amp;nbsp;nm) of [[organic semiconductor]]s including polymers, such as [[polyphenylene vinylene]] and small-molecule compounds like copper phthalocyanine (a blue or green organic pigment) and [[fullerene|carbon fullerenes]] and fullerene derivatives such as [[PCBM]].

They can be processed from liquid solution, offering the possibility of a simple roll-to-roll printing process, potentially leading to inexpensive, large-scale production. In addition, these cells could be beneficial for some applications where mechanical flexibility and disposability are important. Current cell efficiencies are, however, very low, and practical devices are essentially non-existent.

Energy conversion efficiencies achieved to date using conductive polymers are very low compared to inorganic materials. However, [[Konarka]] Power Plastic reached efficiency of 8.3%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pv-tech.org/news/nrel_validates_konarkas_8.3_power_plastic_efficiency_record Konarka Power Plastic reaches 8.3% efficiency]. pv-tech.org. Retrieved 7 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and organic tandem cells in 2012 reached 11.1%.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The active region of an organic device consists of two materials, one electron donor and one electron acceptor. When a photon is converted into an electron hole pair, typically in the donor material, the charges tend to remain bound in the form of an [[exciton]], separating when the exciton diffuses to the donor-acceptor interface, unlike most other solar cell types. The short exciton diffusion lengths of most polymer systems tend to limit the efficiency of such devices. Nanostructured interfaces, sometimes in the form of bulk heterojunctions, can improve performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1369-7021(07)70276-6| title = Polymer-based solar cells| journal = Materials Today| volume = 10| issue = 11| page = 28| year = 2007| last1 = Mayer | first1 = A. | last2 = Scully | first2 = S. | last3 = Hardin | first3 = B. | last4 = Rowell | first4 = M. | last5 = McGehee | first5 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adaptive cells ===
Adaptive cells change their absorption/reflection characteristics depending on environmental conditions. An adaptive material responds to the intensity and angle of incident light. At the part of the cell where the light is most intense, the cell surface changes from reflective to adaptive, allowing the light to penetrate the cell. The other parts of the cell remain reflective increasing the retention of the absorbed light within the cell.&lt;ref name=tr1407&gt;Bullis, Kevin (30 July 2014) [http://www.technologyreview.com/news/529476/adaptive-material-could-cut-the-cost-of-solar-in-half Adaptive Material Could Cut the Cost of Solar in Half]. ''MIT Technology Review''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a system was developed that combined an adaptive surface with a glass substrate that redirect the absorbed to a light absorber on the edges of the sheet. The system also includes an array of fixed lenses/mirrors to concentrate light onto the adaptive surface. As the day continues, the concentrated light moves along the surface of the cell. That surface switches from reflective to adaptive when the light is most concentrated and back to reflective after the light moves along.&lt;ref name=tr1407/&gt;

=== Surface texturing ===
[[File:SolarImpulse HB-SIA landing Brussels Airport 3-crop.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Solar Impulse]] aircraft are Swiss-designed single-seat monoplanes powered entirely from photovoltaic cells]]

For the past years, researchers have been trying to reduce the price of solar cells while maximizing efficiency. [[Thin-film solar cell]] is a cost-effective second generation solar cell with much reduced thickness at the expense of light absorption efficiency. Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Patrick|author2=Green, Martin A. |title=Light Trapping Properties of Pyramidally textured surfaces|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=Feb 1987|volume=62|issue=1| pages=243–249|doi=10.1063/1.339189|bibcode=1987JAP....62..243C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids. Multicrystalline silicon solar cells, due to poorer crystallographic quality, are less effective than single crystal solar cells, but mc-Si solar cells are still being used widely due to less manufacturing difficulties. It is reported that multicrystalline solar cells can be surface-textured to yield solar energy conversion efficiency comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells, through isotropic etching or photolithography techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Jianhua|author2=Wang, Aihua |author3=Green, Martin A.|title=19.8% efficient "honeycomb" textured multicrystalline and 24.4% monocrystalline silicon solar cells|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=May 1998|volume=73|issue=14| pages=1991–1993|doi=10.1063/1.122345|bibcode=1998ApPhL..73.1991Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hauser|first=H.|author2=Michl, B.|author3=Kubler, V.|author4= Schwarzkopf, S.|author5= Muller, C.|author6= Hermle, M.|author7= Blasi, B.|title=Nanoimprint Lithography for Honeycomb Texturing of Multicrystalline Silicon|journal=Energy Procedia|date=2011|volume=8|pages=648–653|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2011.06.196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incident light rays onto a textured surface do not reflect back out to the air as opposed to rays onto a flat surface. Rather some light rays are bounced back onto the other surface again due to the geometry of the surface. This process significantly improves light to electricity conversion efficiency, due to increased light absorption. This texture effect as well as the interaction with other interfaces in the PV module is a challenging optical simulation task. A particularly efficient method for modeling and optimization is the [[OPTOS formalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tucher|first=Nico|last2=Eisenlohr|first2=Johannes|last3=Gebrewold|first3=Habtamu|last4=Kiefel|first4=Peter|last5=Höhn|first5=Oliver|last6=Hauser|first6=Hubert|last7=Goldschmidt|first7=Jan Christoph|last8=Bläsi|first8=Benedikt|date=11 July 2016|title=Optical simulation of photovoltaic modules with multiple textured interfaces using the matrix-based formalism OPTOS|journal=Optics Express|volume=24|issue=14|pages=A1083–A1093|doi=10.1364/OE.24.0A1083|pmid=27410896|bibcode=2016OExpr..24A1083T}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, researchers at MIT reported that c-Si films textured with nanoscale inverted pyramids could achieve light absorption comparable to 30 times thicker planar c-Si.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mavrokefalos|first=Anastassios|author2=Han, Sang Eon. |author3=Yerci, Selcuk |author4= Branham, M.S.|author5= Chen, Gang. |title=Efficient Light Trapping in Inverted Nanopyramid Thin Crystalline Silicon Membranes for Solar Cell Applications|journal=Nano Letters|date=June 2012|volume=12|issue=6| pages=2792–2796|doi=10.1021/nl2045777|bibcode=2012NanoL..12.2792M |pmid=22612694|hdl=1721.1/86899}}&lt;/ref&gt; In combination with [[anti-reflective coating]], surface texturing technique can effectively trap light rays within a thin film silicon solar cell. Consequently, required thickness for solar cells decreases with the increased absorption of light rays.

=== Encapsulation ===
Solar cells are commonly encapsulated in a transparent polymeric resin to protect the delicate solar cell regions for coming into contact with moisture, dirt, ice, and other conditions expected either during operation or when used outdoors. The encapsulants are commonly made from [[polyvinyl acetate]] or glass. Most encapsulants are uniform in structure and composition, which increases light collection owing to light trapping from total internal reflection of light within the resin. Research has been conducted into structuring the encapsulant to provide further collection of light.

Solar cells share some of the same processing and manufacturing techniques as other semiconductor devices. However, the strict requirements for cleanliness and quality control of semiconductor fabrication are more relaxed for solar cells, lowering costs.

[[Polycrystalline silicon]] wafers are made by wire-sawing block-cast silicon ingots into 180 to 350 micrometer wafers. The wafers are usually lightly [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]]-doped. A surface diffusion of [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] dopants is performed on the front side of the wafer. This forms a p–n junction a few hundred nanometers below the surface.

[[Anti-reflective coating|Anti-reflection coatings]] are then typically applied to increase the amount of light coupled into the solar cell. [[Silicon nitride]] has gradually replaced titanium dioxide as the preferred material, because of its excellent surface passivation qualities. It prevents carrier recombination at the cell surface. A layer several hundred nanometers thick is applied using PECVD. Some solar cells have textured front surfaces that, like anti-reflection coatings, increase the amount of light reaching the wafer. Such surfaces were first applied to single-crystal silicon, followed by multicrystalline silicon somewhat later.

A full area metal contact is made on the back surface, and a grid-like metal contact made up of fine "fingers" and larger "bus bars" are screen-printed onto the front surface using a [[silver]] paste. This is an evolution of the so-called "wet" process for applying electrodes, first described in a US patent filed in 1981 by [[Bayer AG]].&lt;ref&gt;Fitzky, Hans G. and Ebneth, Harold (24 May 1983) {{US patent|4385102}}, "Large-area photovoltaic cell"&lt;/ref&gt; The rear contact is formed by screen-printing a metal paste, typically aluminium. Usually this contact covers the entire rear, though some designs employ a grid pattern. The paste is then fired at several hundred degrees Celsius to form metal electrodes in [[ohmic contact]] with the silicon. Some companies use an additional electro-plating step to increase efficiency. After the metal contacts are made, the solar cells are interconnected by flat wires or metal ribbons, and assembled into [[photovoltaic module|modules]] or "solar panels". Solar panels have a sheet of [[tempered glass]] on the front, and a [[polymer]] encapsulation on the back.

== Disposal ==
Solar cells degrade over time and lose their efficiency. Solar cells in extreme climates, such as desert or polar, are more prone to degradation due to exposure to harsh UV light and snow loads respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jordan |first1=Dirk C. |last2= Kurtz |first2= Sarah R. |date= June 2012 |title= Photovoltaic Degradation Rates – An Analytical Review |url= https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/51664.pdf |journal=Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications |access-date= 6 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, solar panels are given a lifespan of 25–30 years before they get decommissioned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.energysage.com/how-long-do-solar-panels-last/ How long do solar panels last?]. CleanTechnica (4 February 2019). Retrieved 6 March 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Renewable Energy Agency estimated that the amount of solar panel waste generated in 2016 was 43,500–250,000 metric tons. This number is estimated to increase substantially by 2030, reaching an estimated waste volume of 60–78 million metric tons in 2050.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2016/IRENA_IEAPVPS_End-of-Life_Solar_PV_Panels_2016.pdf End-of-Life Management: Solar Photovoltaic Panels].

=== Recycling ===
Solar panels are recycled through different methods. The recycling process include a three step process, module recycling, cell recycling and waste handling, to break down Si modules and recover various materials. The recovered metals and Si are re-usable to the solar industry and generate $11–12.10/module in revenue at today's prices for Ag and solar-grade Si.

Some solar modules (For example: First Solar CdTe solar module) contains toxic materials like lead and cadmium which, when broken, could possible leach into the soil and contaminate the environment. The First Solar panel recycling plant opened in Rousset, France in 2018. It was set to recycle 1300 tonnes of solar panel waste a year, and can increase its capacity to 4000 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;If Solar Panels Are So Clean, Why Do They Produce So Much Toxic Waste?.
