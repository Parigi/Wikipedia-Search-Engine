==History==
Precision Castparts (PCC) was founded by [[Joseph Buford Cox]] on April 1, 1953.&lt;ref name="pcc"&gt;[http://www.precast.com/PCC/History_txt.html History.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20020311141228/http://www.precast.com/PCC/History_txt.html |date=March 11, 2002 }} Precision Castparts. Retrieved on February 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Cox was owner of Oregon Saw Chain and in 1949 had started a casting operation with assistant general manager Ed Cooley also working on the project. In 1953 Cox separated the two companies and PCC was formed, moving into a new larger facility in 1955, and incorporating the following year with Ed Cooley as one of the owners.&lt;ref name="pcc"/&gt;

Beginning in the 1960s, the company began to secure contracts to provide parts for jet engines. In 1967 they were awarded a contract by [[General Electric]] to provide parts for their TF39 engine and another contract with [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]].&lt;ref name="pcc"/&gt; The following year the company was taken public and began work with [[Boeing]].&lt;ref name="pcc"/&gt; In 1968 Precision Castparts became a public company with the offering 120,000 shares of common stock to 1,100 new shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.precast.com/overview/history/|title=Welcome to Precision Castparts Corp.|work=Precision Castparts Corp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s PCC was also casting parts for body part replacements such as hips and knees.

===1980s and 1990s===
In the early 1980s, PCC expanded their facilities with several additions. In 1985 the company acquired a titanium foundry in Europe and built a new plant the next year in France.&lt;ref name="pcc"/&gt; Over the next few years PCC acquired other companies such as Airfoils, and AETC Limited of [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref name="pcc"/&gt; In 1989, PCC was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, trading as PCP.&lt;ref name="pcc"/&gt;

In 1991, Bill McCormick became CEO. Acquisitions continued in the 1990s with Advanced Forming Technology, ACC Electronics, Quamco, Astro Punch, and Olofsson Corporation.&lt;ref name="pcc"/&gt; In 1997 PCC bought J&amp;L Fiber Services, Pittler Maschinenfabrik GmbH, and Schlosser Casting Company. Over the next ten years the company continued to grow through acquiring other companies around the world in places such as [[Romania]], Scotland, Switzerland, and Australia as well as companies within the United States including SPS Technologies.&lt;ref name="pcc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giegerich, Andy.
