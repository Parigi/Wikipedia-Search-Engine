The '''Xbox''' is a [[home video game console]] and the first installment in the [[Xbox#Consoles|Xbox series of video game consoles]] manufactured by [[Microsoft]]. It was released as Microsoft's first foray into the gaming console market on November 15, 2001, in North America, followed by Australia, Europe and Japan in 2002.&lt;ref name="microsoft2001"/&gt; It is classified as a [[Sixth generation of video game consoles|sixth generation console]], competing with [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Nintendo]]'s [[GameCube]]. It was also the first major console produced by an American company since the [[Atari Jaguar]] ceased production in 1996.

Announced on March 10, 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000407064456/http://www.xbox.com/intro.htm |title=Microsoft announces X-BOX |date=2000-04-07 |website=web.archive.org |access-date=2020-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Xbox was graphically powerful compared to its rivals, featuring a 733&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Intel Pentium III]] processor, a processor that could be found on a standard [[Personal computer|PC]]. It was also noted for its PC-like size and weight, and was the first console to feature a built-in [[hard disk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/08/technology/08GAME.html?pagewanted=all |title=GAME THEORY; Console Shootout: The Sequel |first=Charles |last=Herold |date=2001-11-08 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=June 10, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205005742/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/08/technology/08GAME.html?pagewanted=all |archive-date=February 5, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/11/23/the-life-and-death-of-the-original-xbox |title=The Life and Death of the Original Xbox |first=Mitch |last=Dyer |date=November 23, 2011 |publisher= |accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2002, Microsoft launched [[Xbox Live]], a fee-based [[online game|online gaming]] service that enabled subscribers to download new content and connect with other players through a [[broadband]] connection.&lt;ref name="nelson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://majornelson.com/2010/02/05/xbox-live-being-discontinued-for-original-xbox-consoles-and-games/ |title=Xbox Live's Major Nelson » Xbox LIVE being discontinued for Original Xbox consoles and games |publisher=Majornelson.com |date=April 15, 2010 |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425023525/https://majornelson.com/2010/02/05/xbox-live-being-discontinued-for-original-xbox-consoles-and-games/ |archive-date=April 25, 2018 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike online services from [[Sega]] and Sony, Xbox Live had support in the original console design through an integrated [[Ethernet]] port. The service gave Microsoft an early foothold in online gaming and would help the Xbox become a competitor in the sixth generation of consoles. The popularity of [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster titles]] such as [[Bungie Software|Bungie]]'s ''[[Halo 2]]'' contributed to the popularity of online console gaming, and in particular [[first-person shooter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk-microsites.ign.com/history-of-first-person-shooters/ |title=History Of First Person Shooters |publisher= |accessdate=December 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824220536/http://uk-microsites.ign.com/history-of-first-person-shooters/ |archive-date=August 24, 2017 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Xbox had a record-breaking launch in North America, selling 1.5 million units before the end of 2001, aided by the popularity of one of the system's launch titles, ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', which sold a million units by April 2002. The system went on to sell a worldwide total of 24 million units, including 16 million in North America; however, Microsoft was unable to make a steady profit off of the console, which had a manufacturing price far more expensive than its retail price, despite its popularity, losing over $4 billion during its market life. The system outsold the GameCube and the [[Sega]] [[Dreamcast]], but was vastly outsold by the PS2, which had sold over 100 million units by the system's discontinuation in 2005. It also underperformed outside of the Western market; particularly, it sold poorly in Japan due to its large console size and overabundance of games marketed towards American audiences as opposed to Japanese-developed titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2002/BUSINESS/asia/02/21/tokyo.xbox.launch/index.html |title=CNN.com - Xbox plugs into Japan |date=2002-02-21 |publisher=CNN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819150753/http://www.cnn.com/2002/BUSINESS/asia/02/21/tokyo.xbox.launch/index.html |archive-date=August 19, 2019 |access-date=2019-08-19 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the system was discontinued in 2005,&lt;ref name="Story of Xbox - VG247"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/08/02/the-xbox-story-part-1-the-birth-of-a-console/ |title=The Xbox Story, Part 1: The Birth of a Console |last=Garratt |first=Patrick |date=August 5, 2011 |publisher=vg247.com |accessdate=June 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611092113/http://www.vg247.com/2011/08/02/the-xbox-story-part-1-the-birth-of-a-console/ |archive-date=June 11, 2013 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Microsoft fully ceasing out-of-warranty support in 2009 and ending Xbox Live support for the system in 2010. The Xbox was the first in an ongoing [[Xbox|brand of video game consoles]] developed by Microsoft, with a successor, the [[Xbox 360]], launching in 2005, followed by the [[Xbox One]] in 2013.

==History==
===Creation and development===
Before the Xbox, [[Microsoft]] had found success publishing video games for its [[Windows]] PCs, releasing popular titles such as ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator]]'' and the massively successful ''[[Age of Empires]]''. However, the company had not delved into the home console market of video games, which was dominated at the time by [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. Sony was working on its next video game console, the [[PlayStation 2]] (PS2), announced officially to the public on March 2, 1999, and intended for the system to act as a gateway for all types of home entertainment. Microsoft CEO [[Bill Gates]] saw the upcoming PS2 as a threat to Microsoft's line of Windows PCs, worrying that the all-encompassing system could eliminate consumer interests in PCs and drive them out of the market. With video games rapidly growing into a massive industry, Gates decided that Microsoft needed to venture into the console gaming market in order to compete with Sony. Previously, [[Sega]] had developed a version of [[Windows Embedded Compact|Windows CE]] for its [[Dreamcast]] console to be used by game developers. Additionally, Gates had directly approached Sony CEO [[Nobuyuki Idei]] prior to the public announcement of the PS2 in regards to letting Microsoft develop programming software for the console, but the offer was declined by Idei in favor of having Sony create proprietary software.&lt;ref name="VentureBeat"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/11/14/making-of-the-xbox-1/ |title=The making of the Xbox: How Microsoft unleashed a video game revolution (part 1) |date=November 14, 2011 |website=VentureBeat |access-date=June 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601215722/https://venturebeat.com/2011/11/14/making-of-the-xbox-1/ |archive-date=June 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, four engineers from Microsoft's [[DirectX]] team - Kevin Bachus, [[Seamus Blackley]], Ted Hase and DirectX team leader Otto Berkes&lt;ref name=seattletimes_20110525&gt;{{cite news |title=Last of Xbox Dream Team, Otto Berkes Is Moving On |first=Brier |last=Dudley |date=May 25, 2011 |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |page=A12 |quote=Berkes and Hase were among a group of four who first pushed Microsoft to develop a Windows-based gaming system to compete with Sony's PlayStation 2, which was luring game companies from the Windows platform in the late 1990s. The other two were Seamus Blackley, who left in 2002, and Kevin Bachus, who left in 2001.}}&lt;/ref&gt;- began discussing ideas for a new console which would run off of Microsoft's DirectX technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/16/how-the-xbox-was-born-at-35000-feet-a-ign-unfiltered |title = How The Xbox Was Born At 35,000 Feet | first = Joseph |last=Knoop |date = May 16, 2018 |accessdate=May 16, 2018 |work=[[IGN]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180516191331/http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/16/how-the-xbox-was-born-at-35000-feet-a-ign-unfiltered | archive-date = May 16, 2018 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nat Brown, the Windows Software Architect at Microsoft, would also become a regular contributor to the project after meeting Hase in November 1998. The project was codenamed "Midway", in reference to the [[Battle of Midway]] during [[World War II]] in which Japan was decisively defeated by American forces, as a representation of Microsoft's desire to surpass Sony in the console market.&lt;ref name="VentureBeat"/&gt; The DirectX team held their first development meeting on March 30, 1999, in which they discussed issues such as getting a PC to boot at a quicker pace than usual.&lt;ref name="VentureBeat"/&gt; The console would run off of [[Windows 2000]] using [[DirectX 8.1]], which would allow PC developers to easily transition into making games for the console, while also granting it a larger processing power than that of most other home consoles.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/the-history-of-the-xbox/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606112355/https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/the-history-of-the-xbox/ |archive-date=June 6, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Blackley, using PC technology as the foundation for a video game console would eliminate the technological barriers of most home consoles, allowing game creators to expand further on their own creativity without having to worry about hardware limitations.&lt;ref name="VentureBeat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Life&amp;Death"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/11/23/the-life-and-death-of-the-original-xbox |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515071836/https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/11/23/the-life-and-death-of-the-original-xbox |archive-date=May 15, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4 DirectX team members encountered disagreements with the [[Silicon Valley]] engineering team behind [[WebTV]], which joined Microsoft after they purchased the rights to the device. Microsoft executive Craig Mundie wanted the project to be led by the WebTV team, who believed the console should be built from the ground-up as an appliance running off of Windows CE; however, the DirectX team were adamant about the idea of repurposing PC hardware components, such as a [[hard disk drive]], arguing that they were cheaply manufactured and could easily be updated every year. The 4 developers gained the support of [[Ed Fries]], the head of Microsoft's gaming division, who believed the use of a hard drive in particular would give the console a technical edge among competitors despite its high manufacturing cost. The two opposing teams both pitched their arguments to Gates on May 5, 1999 at a meeting attended by over 20 different people. WebTV's team, among whom were Nick Baker, Dave Riola, Steve Perlman, and Tim Bucher as well as their sponsor, Craig Mundie, made the case that creating an appliance would be far cheaper, highlighting that most consoles were generally sold at around $300. They also wanted to use a custom-made graphics chip, the likes of which could be shared across several different home devices. Conversely, Fries, vouching for the DirectX team, argued that using a PC hard drive would and set Microsoft's console apart from competitors by allowing for the direct implementation of [[online access]], an argument which Gates sided with. When Gates questioned if PC games could be effectively ported to the new console, Blackley explained that the machine would utilize DirectX hardware, meaning that they could be converted easily. Gates heavily favored this proposition over WebTV's, whose concept relied on Windows CE, a heavily stripped-down Windows variant that wasn't compatible with DirectX. As such, Gates sided with the DirectX concept, and gave Berkes' team the go-ahead to create a new video game console. Despite this, WebTV would still play a part in the Xbox's initial launch.&lt;ref name="VentureBeat"/&gt;

The DirectX team began constructing prototype consoles, purchasing several [[Dell]] computers and using their internal parts.&lt;ref name=seattletimes_20110524&gt;{{cite news |title= Exclusive: Microsoft loses last Xbox founder, mobile PC visionary |first=Brier |last=Dudley |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/technologybrierdudleysblog/2015137144_its_the_end_of_an.html |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=May 24, 2011 |accessdate=May 25, 2011 |quote=In 1998, Berkes and his team ordered a few Dell laptops, took them apart and built the first prototypes of a Windows gaming console.

However, "Xbox" proved to be the more popular name on the list during consumer testing, and was thus selected as the official name of the product.&lt;ref name=gamasutra_2009-08-14&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=24831 |title=Interview: Former Microsoft Exec Fries Talks Xbox's Genesis |first=Leigh |last=Alexander |date=August 14, 2009 |work=Gamasutra |publisher=UBM TechWeb |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yxGkLXlW?url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=24831 |archivedate=May 25, 2011 |accessdate=May 25, 2011 |quote=Direct X-Box, of course, was truncated to 'Xbox,' -- and "marketing hated the name," says Fries. "They went off and created this whole, long list of better names for the machine." In focus testing, the marketing team left the name 'Xbox' on that long list simply as a control, to demonstrate to everyone why it was a horrible name for a console. "Of course, 'Xbox' outscored, in focus testing, everything they came up with. They had to admit it was going to be the Xbox." |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the physical design of the controller began, [[circuit board]]s for the controller had already been manufactured. Microsoft had asked Sony's supplier, [[Mitsumi Electric]], for a similar folded and stacked circuit board design used in Sony's [[DualShock#DuaShock 2|DualShock 2]] controller, but the company refused to manufacture such a design for Microsoft. This led to the controller being bulky and nearly three times the size of Sony's controller. This initial controller design was never launched in Japan, where the console instead launched with a smaller, redesigned version named "Controller S" that did use the more compact circuit board design.&lt;ref name="engadget-dukestory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnbc-circuitboard"/&gt;

===Announcement===
Gates first publicly mentioned the Xbox in an interview in late 1999, stating that he wanted the system to become the best and most creative game developers in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://news.microsoft.com/2000/03/10/xbox-brings-future-generation-games-to-life/ |title=Xbox Brings "Future-Generation" Games to Life |publisher=Microsoft |date=March 10, 2000 |accessdate=May 3, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201062207/http://news.microsoft.com/2000/03/10/xbox-brings-future-generation-games-to-life/ |archive-date=December 1, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was later announced officially by Gates in a [[keynote]] presentation at the [[Game Developers Conference]] on March 10, 2000, showing off an early prototype build of the system and a series of demos showcasing its hardware.&lt;ref name="VentureBeat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/2000/03-10xbox.aspx |title=Xbox Brings "Future-Generation" Games to Life |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=March 10, 2000 |accessdate=August 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313001634/http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/2000/03-10xbox.aspx |archive-date=March 13, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The presentation and the new system were well-received, impressing developers with both the hard drive and the Ethernet port and appealing to them with the notion of easy-to-use development tools.&lt;ref name="VentureBeat"/&gt; At the time of Gates's announcement, Sega's Dreamcast sales were diminishing and Sony's PlayStation 2 was just going on sale in Japan.&lt;ref name="xboxtimeline1"&gt;{{cite web|first=Steven L. |last=Kent |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/january04/Xboxtimeline/ |title=Xbox Timeline |publisher=GameSpy.com |date=February 16, 2004 |accessdate=May 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425202720/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/january04/Xboxtimeline/ |archivedate=April 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates was in talks with Sega's late chairman [[Isao Okawa]] about the possibility of Xbox compatibility with Dreamcast games, but negotiations fell apart over whether or not the Dreamcast's [[SegaNet]] online service should be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5447897/how-xbox-could-have-helped-the-dreamcast-survive|title=How Xbox Could Have Helped The Dreamcast Survive|first=Brian|last=Ashcraft|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825063139/http://kotaku.com/5447897/how-xbox-could-have-helped-the-dreamcast-survive|archive-date=August 25, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Xbox was officially unveiled to the public by Gates and guest professional wrestler [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] at [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] 2001 in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] on January 3, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1040-250632.html |title=Microsoft got game: Xbox unveiled |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=CNET News |date=January 6, 2001 |accessdate=August 12, 2013 |first=David |last=Becker |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224054534/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1040-250632.html |archive-date=December 24, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft announced Xbox's release dates and prices at [[History of the Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3 2001]] in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/e3-2001-microsoft-delivers-xbox-launch-details-2761182 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130628041548/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/e3-2001-microsoft-delivers-xbox-launch-details-2761182 |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 28, 2013 |title=E3 2001: Microsoft delivers Xbox launch details |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=GameSpot.com |date=May 16, 2001 |accessdate=August 12, 2013 |author=Lauren Fielder, Shane Satterfield }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Xbox launch titles were unveiled at E3, most notably ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' and ''[[Dead or Alive 3]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tomshardware.co.uk/e3-2001,review-3623.html|title=E3 2001: The Game Industry Goes Gaga|date=2001-05-23|website=Tom's Hardware|language=en|access-date=2019-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190824211750/https://www.tomshardware.co.uk/e3-2001,review-3623.html|archive-date=August 24, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation for its launch, Microsoft acquired [[Bungie]] and used ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' as its launch title. At the time, ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]] had been one of the few hit [[First-person shooter|FPS]] games to appear on a console, as well as titles such as ''[[Perfect Dark]]'' and ''[[Medal of Honor (1999 video game)|Medal of Honor]]''. ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' proved a good application to drive the Xbox's sales.&lt;ref name="xboxtimeline1"/&gt;

===Promotion===
In 2002, the [[Independent Television Commission]] (ITC) banned a television advertisement for the Xbox in the [[United Kingdom]] after complaints that it was "offensive, shocking and in bad taste". It depicted a mother giving birth to a baby boy, who is fired like a projectile through a window aging rapidly as he flies through the air. The advertisement ends with an old man crash-landing into his own grave and the slogan, "Life is short. Play more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2028725.stm |title='Shocking' Xbox advert banned |accessdate=July 18, 2007 |date=June 6, 2002 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117020801/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2028725.stm |archive-date=January 17, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discontinuation and successors===
{{main|Xbox 360|List of Xbox games compatible with Xbox 360|Xbox One|List of Xbox games compatible with Xbox One}}

The Xbox's successor, the Xbox 360, was officially announced on May 12, 2005 on [[MTV]]. It was the first next generation system to be announced. It was released in North America on November 22, 2005. [[Nvidia]] ceased production of the Xbox's GPU in August 2005, which marked the end of brand-new Xbox production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/08fce29a-c334-11d9-abf1-00000e2511c8.html |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |title=Nvidia ends shipments of chips for Xbox |accessdate=August 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330002614/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/08fce29a-c334-11d9-abf1-00000e2511c8.html |archive-date=March 30, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last Xbox game in Europe was ''[[Xiaolin Showdown (video game)|Xiaolin Showdown]]'' released in June 2007, and the last game in North America was ''[[Madden NFL 09]]'' released in August 2008.

The Xbox 360 supports [[List of Xbox games compatible with Xbox 360|a limited number of the Xbox's game library]] if the player has an official Xbox 360 Hard Drive. Xbox games were added up until November 2007. Xbox game saves cannot be transferred to Xbox 360, and the ability to play Xbox games through Xbox LIVE has been discontinued since April 15, 2010. It is still possible to play Xbox games with [[System Link]] functionality online via both the original console and the Xbox 360 with tunneling software such as [[XLink Kai]]. It was announced at E3 2017 that the [[Xbox One]] would be gaining support for [[List of Xbox games compatible with Xbox One|a limited number of the Xbox's game library]].

Between 2005 and 2013, fans of the console referred to it as the '''Xbox 1'''; however, due to Microsoft releasing a console called the [[Xbox One]] in 2013, it has since become known as the '''original Xbox'''.

==Hardware ==
[[File:Xbox-Console-Open-Drives.jpg|thumb|right|The use of standard desktop components such as a DVD-ROM and hard drive contributed to much of the Xbox's weight and bulk.]]
[[File:Xbox-Remote-wReceiver.jpg|thumb|right|A separately-sold remote was required for DVD movie playback on the Xbox.]]
{{See also|Xbox (console) special limited editions}}

The Xbox was the first video game console to feature a built-in [[hard disk drive]], used primarily for storing game saves and content downloaded from Xbox Live. This eliminated the need for separate [[memory card]]s (although some older consoles, such as the [[Amiga CD32]], used internal flash memory, and others, such as the [[TurboGrafx-CD]], [[Mega-CD|Sega CD]], and [[Sega Saturn]], had featured built-in battery backup memory prior to 2001). An Xbox user could [[Ripping|rip]] music from [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|standard audio CDs]] to the hard drive, and these songs were used for the custom soundtracks in some games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/909942 |title=Xbox: Description of custom soundtracks |accessdate=January 13, 2008 |date=April 25, 2007 |publisher=Microsoft Knowledge Base |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102180345/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/909942 |archive-date=January 2, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the PlayStation 2, which could play movie DVDs without the need for a remote control (although an optional remote was available), the Xbox required an external IR adapter to be plugged into a controller port in order to play movie DVDs. If DVD playback is attempted without the IR sensor plugged in, an error screen will pop up informing the user of the need for the Xbox DVD Playback Kit. Said kit included the IR sensor and a remote control (unlike the PS2 the Xbox controller could not be used to control DVD playback). Said remote was manufactured by [[Thomson Consumer Electronics|Thomson]] (which also manufactured optical drives for the console), which meant a modified version of the remote design used by the [[RCA]], [[General Electric|GE]] and [[ProScan]] consumer electronics of the era was used for the Xbox remote, and therefore users wishing to use a universal remote were instructed to utilize RCA DVD remote codes.

The Xbox was the first gaming product to feature Dolby Interactive Content-Encoding Technology, which allows real-time Dolby Digital encoding in game consoles. Previous game consoles could only use Dolby Digital 5.1 during non-interactive "cut scene" playback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.dolby.com/assets/pdf/press_releases/841_co.pr.0104.xbox.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219162524/http://www.dolby.com/assets/pdf/press_releases/841_co.pr.0104.xbox.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2006 |title=The Xbox Video Game System from Microsoft to Feature Groundbreaking Dolby Interactive Content-Encoding Technology |date=April 18, 2001 |publisher=[[Dolby Laboratories]] |accessdate=July 3, 2008 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Xbox is based on commodity PC hardware and is much larger and heavier than its contemporaries. This is largely due to a bulky tray-loading [[DVD|DVD-ROM]] drive and the standard-size 3.5&amp;nbsp;inch hard drive. The Xbox has also pioneered safety features, such as breakaway cables for the controllers to prevent the console from being pulled from the surface upon which it rests.

Several internal hardware revisions have been made in an ongoing battle to discourage [[modding]] (hackers continually updated [[modchip]] designs in an attempt to defeat them), to cut manufacturing costs, and to make the DVD-ROM drive more reliable (some of the early units' drives gave Disc Reading Errors due to the unreliable Thomson DVD-ROM drives used). Later generation units that used the Thomson TGM-600 DVD-ROM drives and the Philips VAD6011 DVD-ROM drives were still vulnerable to failure that, respectively, either rendered the consoles unable to read newer discs, or caused them to halt the console with an error code usually indicating a [[Programmed input/output|PIO]]/[[Direct memory access|DMA]] identification failure. These units were not covered under the extended warranty.

In 2002, Microsoft and [[Nvidia]] entered arbitration over a dispute on the pricing of Nvidia's chips for the Xbox.&lt;ref name="eetimes-chip-dispute"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4094562/Microsoft-takes-Nvidia-to-arbitration-over-pricing-of-Xbox-processors |title=Microsoft takes Nvidia to arbitration over pricing of Xbox processors |accessdate=June 29, 2006 |date=April 29, 2002 |magazine=[[EE Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523080029/http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4094562/Microsoft-takes-Nvidia-to-arbitration-over-pricing-of-Xbox-processors |archive-date=May 23, 2012 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nvidia's filing with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] indicated that Microsoft was seeking a $13 million discount on shipments for NVIDIA's fiscal year 2002. Microsoft alleged violations of the agreement the two companies entered, sought reduced chipset pricing, and sought to ensure that Nvidia fulfill Microsoft's chipset orders without limits on quantity. The matter was privately settled on February 6, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4090108/Microsoft-and-Nvidia-settle-Xbox-chip-pricing-dispute |title=Microsoft and Nvidia settle Xbox chip pricing dispute |accessdate=June 29, 2006 |date=February 6, 2003 |magazine=EE Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809030317/http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4090108/Microsoft-and-Nvidia-settle-Xbox-chip-pricing-dispute |archive-date=August 9, 2011 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Xbox includes a standard AV cable which provides [[composite video]] and [[monaural]] or [[stereophonic sound|stereo audio]] to TVs equipped with [[RCA connector|RCA]] inputs. European Xboxes also included an RCA jack to [[SCART]] converter block as well as the standard AV cable.{{clear}}

An 8&amp;nbsp;MB removable [[Solid-state drive|solid state]] [[memory card]] can be plugged into the controllers, onto which game saves can either be copied from the hard drive when in the Xbox dashboard's memory manager or saved during a game. Most Xbox game saves can be copied to the memory unit and moved to another console but some Xbox saves are digitally signed. It is also possible to save an Xbox Live account on a memory unit, to simplify its use on more than one Xbox. The ports at the top of the controllers could also be used for other accessories, primarily headsets for voice chat via Xbox Live.

==Software==
===Operating system===
The Xbox runs a custom [[operating system]] which is based on a heavily modified version of [[Windows 2000]].&lt;ref name="leaked source"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21265995/xbox-source-code-leak-original-console-windows-3-5 |title=Xbox and Windows NT 3.5 source code leaks online |first=Tom |last=Warren |date=May 21, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; It exports [[Application programming interface|API]]s similar to those found in [[Microsoft Windows]], such as [[Direct3D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Trinder |first1=Garry |title=The Xbox Operating System |url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/xboxteam/2006/02/17/the-xbox-operating-system/ |website=Xbox Engineering |publisher=MSDN |accessdate=31 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181102200600/https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/xboxteam/2006/02/17/the-xbox-operating-system/ |archive-date=November 2, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its source code was [[Source code leak|leaked]] in 2020.&lt;ref name="leaked source" /&gt;

The [[user interface]] for the Xbox is called the Xbox Dashboard. It features a [[media player (application software)|media player]] that can be used to play music CDs, rip CDs to the Xbox's built-in [[hard drive]] and play music that has been ripped to the hard drive; it also lets users manage game saves, music, and downloaded content from Xbox Live, and lets Xbox Live users sign in, customize, and manage their account. The dashboard is only available when the user is not watching a movie or playing a game. It uses many shades of green and black for the user interface, to be consistent with the physical Xbox color scheme. When the Xbox was released in 2001, the Live service was not online so the dashboard's Live sections, as well as the network settings sub-menu, were not present yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2001/11/15/technology/xbox/ |title=Microsoft launches Xbox |date=2001-11-15 |publisher=CNN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190521211233/https://money.cnn.com/2001/11/15/technology/xbox/|archive-date=May 21, 2019 |access-date=2019-08-18 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.microsoft.com/2002/08/13/xbox-live-to-launch-on-one-year-anniversary-of-console-launch/ |title=Xbox Live to Launch on One-Year Anniversary of Console Launch |date=2002-08-13 |website=Stories |access-date=2019-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190818215623/https://news.microsoft.com/2002/08/13/xbox-live-to-launch-on-one-year-anniversary-of-console-launch/ |archive-date=August 18, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Xbox launched in North America on November 15, 2001. Popular launch games included ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', ''[[Project Gotham Racing (video game)|Project Gotham Racing]]'', and ''[[Dead or Alive 3]]''. All three of these games would go on to sell over a million copies in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-magicbox.com/Chart-USPlatinum.shtml|title=The Magic Box - US Platinum Chart Games.|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716215431/http://www.the-magicbox.com/Chart-USPlatinum.shtml|archive-date=July 16, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the console gained strong third party support from its inception, many early Xbox games did not fully use its powerful hardware until a full year after its release. Xbox versions of cross-platform games sometimes came with a few additional features and/or graphical improvements to distinguish them from the PS2 and [[GameCube]] versions of the same game, thus negating one of the Xbox's main selling points. Sony countered the Xbox for a short time by temporarily securing PlayStation 2 exclusives for highly anticipated games such as the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]] and the [[Metal Gear (series)|''Metal Gear Solid'' series]] as well as Nintendo for the [[Resident Evil (series)|''Resident Evil'' series]]. Notable 3rd party support came from [[Sega]], who announced an 11-game exclusivity deal at [[Tokyo Game Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.microsoft.com/2001/03/30/sega-and-microsoft-team-up-for-strategic-xbox-alliance/|title=Sega and Microsoft Team Up for Strategic Xbox Alliance - News Center|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016|date=2001-03-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630125255/https://news.microsoft.com/2001/03/30/sega-and-microsoft-team-up-for-strategic-xbox-alliance/|archive-date=June 30, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sega]] released exclusives such as ''[[Panzer Dragoon Orta]]'' and ''[[Jet Set Radio Future]]'', which met with a strong reception among critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox/537421-panzer-dragoon-orta/index.html|title=Panzer Dragoon Orta for Xbox - GameRankings|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DiurL6Vg?url=http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox/537421-panzer-dragoon-orta/index.html|archive-date=January 16, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox/475263-jsrf-jet-set-radio-future/index.html|title=JSRF: Jet Set Radio Future for Xbox - GameRankings|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AfxuzgKf?url=http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox/475263-jsrf-jet-set-radio-future/index.html|archive-date=September 14, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 and 2003, several high-profile releases helped the Xbox gain momentum and distinguish itself from the PS2. [[Microsoft]] purchased [[Rare (company)|Rare]], responsible for many [[Nintendo 64]] hit games, to expand their 1st party portfolio.&lt;ref name="ign.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/09/24/microsoft-buys-rare|title=Microsoft Buys Rare|first=Aaron|last=Bouldling|date=September 24, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6aWb8t3m5?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/09/24/microsoft-buys-rare|archive-date=August 4, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Xbox Live]] online service was launched in late 2002 alongside pilot titles ''MotoGP'', ''[[MechAssault]]'' and ''[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon]]''. Several best-selling and critically acclaimed titles for the Xbox soon followed, such as ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell]]'', and ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''. [[Take-Two Interactive]]'s exclusivity deal with [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] was amended to allow ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' and its [[Grand Theft Auto|sequels]] to be published for the Xbox. Many other publishers got into the trend of releasing the Xbox version alongside the PS2 version, instead of delaying it for months.

2004 saw the release of highly rated exclusives [[Fable (2004 video game)|''Fable'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox/516688-fable/index.html|title=Fable for Xbox - GameRankings|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106094057/http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox/516688-fable/index.html|archive-date=November 6, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ninja Gaiden (2004 video game)|''Ninja Gaiden'']],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox/561532-ninja-gaiden/index.html|title=Ninja Gaiden for Xbox - GameRankings|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216194313/http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox/561532-ninja-gaiden/index.html|archive-date=December 16, 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of these games would become big hits for the Xbox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/09/23/fable-sells-big|title=Fable Sells Big|first=David|last=Adams|date=September 23, 2004|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816194737/http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/09/23/fable-sells-big|archive-date=August 16, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, ''[[Halo 2]]'' was released and became the highest-grossing release in entertainment history, making over $125 million in its first day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Halo-2-clears-record-125-million-in-first-day/2100-1043_3-5447379.html|title='Halo 2' clears record $125 million in first day|accessdate=September 30, 2007|last=Becker|first=David|date=November 10, 2004|publisher=News.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008201327/http://news.cnet.com/Halo-2-clears-record-125-million-in-first-day/2100-1043_3-5447379.html|archive-date=October 8, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the [[List of best-selling video games#Xbox|best-selling Xbox game]] worldwide.&lt;ref name="halo2sales"&gt;{{cite news | author=Asher Moses | date=August 30, 2007 | url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/prepare-for-allout-war/2007/08/30/1188067256196.html | title=Prepare for all-out war | newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | accessdate=July 16, 2008 | quote=Combined, the first two Halo games have notched up sales of more than 14.5 million copies so far, about 8 million of which can be attributed to Halo 2, which is the best-selling first-generation Xbox game worldwide. | archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DRmndwtj?url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/prepare-for-allout-war/2007/08/30/1188067256196.html | archive-date=January 5, 2013 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Halo 2]]'' became Xbox Live's third [[killer application|killer app]] after ''[[MechAssault]]'' &amp; ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield#Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3|Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3]]''. That year Microsoft made a deal to put [[Electronic Arts]]'s popular titles on [[Xbox Live]] to boost the popularity of their service.

By 2005, despite notable first party releases in ''[[Conker: Live &amp; Reloaded]]'' and [[Forza Motorsport (video game)|''Forza Motorsport'']], Microsoft began phasing out the Xbox in favor of their next console, the [[Xbox 360]]. Games such as ''[[Kameo: Elements of Power]]'' and ''[[Perfect Dark Zero]]'', which were originally to be developed for the Xbox,&lt;ref name="ign.com"/&gt; became [[Xbox 360]] launch titles instead. The last game released on the Xbox was ''[[Madden NFL 09]]'', on August 12, 2008.

On November 15, 2002, Microsoft launched its Xbox Live online gaming service, allowing subscribers to play online Xbox games with other subscribers around the world and download new content directly to the system's [[hard drive]]. The online service works only with a [[broadband]] Internet connection. In its first week of operation, Xbox Live received 100,000 subscriptions,&lt;ref name="Life&amp;Death"/&gt; and further grew to 250,000 subscribers within two months of the service's launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://games.ign.com/articles/381/381618p1.html |title=Xbox Live Subscriptions Double Expectations |accessdate=September 30, 2007 |author=Coleman, Stephen |date=January 7, 2003 |website=IGN |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314203443/http://games.ign.com/articles/381/381618p1.html |archivedate=March 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2004, Microsoft announced that Xbox Live had reached 1 million subscribers; in July 2005, membership reached two million, and by July 2007 there were more than 3 million subscribers.

Prior to launching, anticipation for the Xbox was high, with [[Toys 'R' Us]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] reporting that online [[preorder]]s had sold out within just 30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/article_31120 |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190531152518/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/article_31120 |archive-date=May 31, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft stated that it planned to ship 1-1.5 million units to retailers by the end of the year, followed by weekly shipments of 100,000 units.&lt;ref name="BizJournal"&gt;https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2001/11/12/daily27.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN Launch"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2001/11/15/technology/xbox/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190521211233/https://money.cnn.com/2001/11/15/technology/xbox/ |archive-date=May 21, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was officially launched at midnight on November 15, 2001, three days prior to the subsequent launch of the Nintendo GameCube.&lt;ref name="BizJournal"/&gt; A special event was held on the prior night at the [[Toys 'R' Us]] store on [[Times Square]], in which 1000 systems were shipped to the store to kick off sales.

Despite strong sales in North America, Microsoft struggled to make a profit from the Xbox due to its high manufacturing cost. With its initial retail price of $299, Microsoft lost about $125 for every system sold, which cost $425 to manufacture, meaning that the company would have to rely on software sales in order to make any money.&lt;ref name="VentureBeat"/&gt; These losses were further exacerbated in April 2002, when Microsoft lowered the retail price of the Xbox even further to $199 in order to further driving hardware sales.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Life&amp;Death"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Price Drop"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1936791.stm |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601230657/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1936791.stm |archive-date=June 1, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft also struggled to compete with Sony's more popular [[PlayStation 2]] console, which generally saw far higher sales numbers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/13/science/playstation-2-shortage-frustrates-more-than-buyers.html |title=PlayStation 2 Shortage Frustrates More Than Buyers |first=Noah |last=Robischon |date=2004-12-13 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=June 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015185050/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/13/science/playstation-2-shortage-frustrates-more-than-buyers.html |archive-date=October 15, 2017 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3981475.stm |title=Slimmer PlayStation triple sales |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=December 30, 2016 |date=2004-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902092538/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3981475.stm |archive-date=September 2, 2007 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Xbox outsold the PS2 in the U.S. in April 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/xbox-officially-outsells-ps2-in-us-6099369 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130628041554/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/xbox-officially-outsells-ps2-in-us-6099369 |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 28, 2013 |title=Xbox officially outsells PS2 in US |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=GameSpot.com |date=May 26, 2004 |accessdate=August 12, 2013 |first=Tor |last=Thorsen }}&lt;/ref&gt; By its manufacturing discontinuation in 2005, the Xbox had sold a total of 24 million units worldwide, 16 million of which had been sold in North America. These numbers fell short of Microsoft's predicted 50 million units, and failed to match the PlayStation 2's lifetime sales of 106 million units at the time, although it did surpass the GameCube and [[Dreamcast]]'s lifetime sales of 21 million and 10.6 units, respectively.&lt;ref name="gamers_catch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Life&amp;Death"/&gt; Ultimately, Microsoft lost an accumulative total of $4 billion from the Xbox, only managing to turn a profit at the end of 2004.&lt;ref name="Life&amp;Death"/&gt;

===Japan===
Prior to its Japanese launch in February 2002, many analysts estimated that the Xbox would have trouble competing with the PS2 and the GameCube, its local counterparts in the region, noting its comparatively high price tag, lack of exclusives, and larger size which wouldn't fit as well in living spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/worldbiz/archives/2002/02/21/0000124876 |title=Game-over for Xbox in Japan? |newspaper=[[Taipei Times]] |date=February 21, 2002 |accessdate=August 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211114856/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/worldbiz/archives/2002/02/21/0000124876 |archive-date=December 11, 2013 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft hoped to ship 6 million Japanese Xbox consoles by June 2002; however, the system had only sold a total of 190,000 units in the region by April of that year, 2 months after the system's launch in February.&lt;ref name="Japan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2002/BUSINESS/asia/04/10/japan.xbox/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601212749/http://www.cnn.com/2002/BUSINESS/asia/04/10/japan.xbox/index.html |archive-date=June 1, 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the week ending April 14, 2002, the Xbox sold only 1,800 units, considerably less than the PS2 and GameCube, and failed to see a single title reach the top 50 best-selling video games in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2002/04/18/japan-gcn-sales |title=Japan GCN sales |publisher=[[IGN Entertainment]] |date=April 18, 2002 |accessdate=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2002, the Xbox chief in Japan stepped down, leading to further consultations about Xbox's future, which by that point had only sold 278,860 units in the country since its February launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |date=December 2002 |title=Xbox dead in Japan? |magazine= [[GamesTM]] |issue=1 |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |page=11 |issn=1478-5889 |url=https://archive.org/details/gamesTM001 |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |quote="Xbox is failing in Japan, there's no denying it.

These embarrassing figures have resulted in Hirohisa Ohura, Director of Xbox Japan, being moved to a different department within Microsoft, hinting that a certain amount of re-structuring is about to take place." |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409213046/https://archive.org/details/gamesTM001 |archive-date=April 9, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pinoyexchange.com/forums/showthread.php?t=124138 |title=Japan Xbox chief steps down |publisher=PinoyExchange Forums |date=November 10, 2002 |accessdate=August 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924042759/http://www.pinoyexchange.com/forums/showthread.php?t=124138 |archive-date=September 24, 2014 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the week ending July 18, 2004, the Xbox sold just 272 units, even less than the PSOne had sold in the same week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamepro.com/microsoft/xbox/games/news/37034.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040817075442/http://www.gamepro.com/microsoft/xbox/games/news/37034.shtml |title=Xbox Outsold by PS one in Japan |publisher=[[IDG Entertainment]] |work=GamePro.com |date=July 23, 2004 |accessdate=August 12, 2013 |archivedate=August 17, 2004 |author=Funky Zealot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Xbox did, however, outsell the GameCube for the week ending May 26, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.computerandvideogames.com/49940/xbox-overtakes-gamecube-in-japan |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130413071036/http://m.computerandvideogames.com/49940/xbox-overtakes-gamecube-in-japan |url-status=dead |title=Xbox overtakes GameCube in Japan |archivedate=April 13, 2013 |website=computerandvideogames.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the Xbox had only sold 450,000 units as of November 2011.&lt;ref name="Life&amp;Death"/&gt; Factors believed to have contributed to the console's poor market presence included its large physical size, which contrasted the country's emphasis on more compact designs, and a lack of Japanese-developed games to aid consumer interest.&lt;ref name="Life&amp;Death"/&gt;

==Modding==
{{main|Xbox modding}}
The popularity of the Xbox, as well as (in the United States) its comparatively short 90-day warranty, inspired efforts to circumvent the built-in hardware and software security mechanisms, a practice informally known as [[modding]].
