{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2014}}

'''Hollywood accounting''' (also known as Hollywood [[bookkeeping]]) refers to the opaque or [[creative accounting]] [[accounting methods|methods]] used by the film, video, and television industry to budget and record profits for film projects. Expenditures can be inflated to reduce or eliminate the reported [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] of the project, thereby reducing the amount which the corporation must pay in taxes and [[royalties]] or other [[profit-sharing agreement]]s, as these are based on the [[net profit]].

Hollywood accounting gets its name from its prevalence in the entertainment industry—that is, in the [[Film|movie]] studios of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] at a time when most studios were located in Hollywood. Those affected can include writers and actors, but also production companies, producers and investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McDougal|first=Dennis|title=Judge Must Solve Buchwald-Murphy Whodunit: Lawsuits: Final arguments in multimillion-dollar complaint against Paramount are over.

Hollywood bookkeeping can be very suspect.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of cases of creative accounting have been successfully pursued in court and resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in awarded damages.

==Practices==
Hollywood accounting can take several forms. In one form, a [[subsidiary]] is formed to perform a given activity and the parent entity will extract money out of the film's [[revenue]] in the form of charges for certain "services". For example, a [[film studio]] has a distribution arm as a sub-entity, which will then charge the studio a "distribution fee" — essentially, the studio charging itself a sum it has total control over and hence control the profitability report of a project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/09/how-hollywood-accounting-can-make-a-450-million-movie-unprofitable/245134/|title=How Hollywood Accounting Can Make a $450 Million Movie 'Unprofitable'|last=Thompson|first=Derek|date=September 14, 2011|newspaper=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another form of Hollywood accounting is a reverse [[Tobashi scheme]], in which the studio unjustly [[Cross-collateralization|cross-collateralizes]] the accounting of two projects and shifts losses from a flop onto a profitable project by shifting costs involving internal operations. This way, two unprofitable projects are created out of one on paper alone, primarily for the purpose of eliminating net participation liabilities. The specific schemes can range from the simple and obvious to the extremely complex. Generally, Hollywood accounting utilizes permanent creative accounting practices (such as charging an arbitrary distribution fee from one sub-entity to another) rather than temporary ones (like the [[Repo 105|Repo 105 scheme]]) since the measures are meant to permanently distort the [[bottom line]] of a film project.

Three main factors in Hollywood accounting reduce the reported profit of a movie, and all have to do with the calculation of [[overhead (business)|overhead]]:

* Production overhead: Studios, on average, calculate production overhead by using a figure around 15% of total production costs.
* Distribution overhead: [[Film distributor]]s typically keep 30% of what they receive from movie theaters ("gross rentals").
* Marketing overhead: To determine this number, studios usually choose about 10% of all advertising costs.

All of the above means of calculating overhead are highly controversial, even within the accounting profession. Namely, these percentages are assigned without much regard to how, in reality, these estimates relate to actual overhead costs. In short, this method does not, by any rational standard, attempt to adequately trace overhead costs.

Because of the studio's ability to place arbitrary charges along the [[Value chain]], net participation "points" (a percentage of the [[net income]] as opposed to a percentage of the gross income of a film) are sometimes referred to as "monkey points". The term is attributed to [[Eddie Murphy]], who is said to have also stated that only a fool would accept net points in their contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McDougal|first=Dennis|title=Murphy Movie Made Millions But Stayed in Red, Studio Ledgers Say |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-04/news/mn-537_1_eddie-murphy-productions|accessdate=March 23, 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 4, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Leibman|first=Jordan H.|title=Fatal Subtraction: The Inside Story of Buchwald v. Paramount.|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/legal/415182-1.html |accessdate=March 23, 2014|newspaper=[[AllBusiness.com]]|date=November 1, 1993|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201071322/http://www.allbusiness.com/legal/415182-1.html |archivedate=February 1, 2009}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"By the way, you called net profit participation points yesterday 'monkey points.' What's the origin of that, do you know?" I asked Eddie [Murphy] as I started to pick up my papers. "Well, it's like 'stupid' points. Stupid to take the points." "Won't be any net profits?" "You sit there with your points going, 'Eeeh, eeh, eeh, eeh, eeh'."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Actress [[Lynda Carter]] on ''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show with Joan Rivers]]'' commented "Don't ever settle for net profits. It's called 'creative accounting'."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show with Joan Rivers]]''. Fox Network. Air date: February 9, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Many insist on "gross points" (a percentage of some definition of [[gross (economics)|gross]] revenue) rather than net profit participation. This practice reduces the likelihood of a project showing a profit, as a production company will claim a portion of the reported box-office revenue was diverted directly to gross point participants. However, gross participation is a rare bargaining chip allowed by the studios and hence hard to obtain unless the person has considerable leverage in the deal - such as an A-list star, director or producer who is vital for a project.

==Examples==
According to [[Lucasfilm]], ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', despite having earned $475 million at the box office against a budget of $32.5 million, "has never gone into profit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/lucasfilm-tells-darth-vader-that-return-of-the-jedi-hasnt-made-a-profit/ |title=LucasFilm Tells Darth Vader that Return of the Jedi Hasn't Made a Profit!? |first=Peter |last=Sciretta |publisher=Slashfilm.com |date=April 5, 2009 |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Art Buchwald]] received a settlement from Paramount after his lawsuit ''[[Buchwald v. Paramount]]''. The court found Paramount's actions "unconscionable", noting that it was impossible to believe that Eddie Murphy's 1988 comedy ''[[Coming to America]]'', which grossed $288 million, failed to make a profit, especially since the actual production costs were less than a tenth of that. Paramount settled for $900,000,&lt;ref&gt;(http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-17/local/me-3895_1_net-profit Buchwald, Partner Win $900,000 From Studio)&lt;/ref&gt; rather than have its accounting methods closely scrutinized.

Producers [[Michael Uslan]] and [[Benjamin Melniker]] filed a [[breach of contract]] lawsuit in [[Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors|Los Angeles County Superior Court]] on March 26, 1992. Uslan and Melniker claimed to be "the victims of a sinister campaign of fraud and coercion that has cheated them out of continuing involvement in the production of the 1989 film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' and its sequels. We were denied proper credits, and deprived of any financial rewards for our indispensable creative contribution to the success of ''Batman''."&lt;ref name="Guber"&gt;{{cite book | author = Nancy Griffin; Kim Masters | title = Hit &amp; Run: How Jon Peters and Peter Guber Took Sony For A Ride In Hollywood | publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year = 1997 | location =  | pages = [https://archive.org/details/hitrunhowjonpete00grif/page/158 158–174] | isbn = 0-684-80931-1 | chapter = Hit Men | url = https://archive.org/details/hitrunhowjonpete00grif/page/158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[superior court]] judge rejected the lawsuit. Total revenues of ''Batman'' have topped $2 billion, with Uslan claiming to have "not seen a penny more than that since our net profit participation has proved worthless."&lt;ref name="Guber" /&gt; Warner Bros. offered the pair an out-of-court pay-off, a sum described by Uslan and Melniker's attorney as "two popcorns and two [[Coca-Cola|Coke]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Olly Richards (September 1992).

[[Winston Groom]]'s price for the screenplay rights to his novel ''[[Forrest Gump (novel)|Forrest Gump]]'' included a 3% share of the profits; however, due to Hollywood accounting, the film's commercial success was converted into a net loss, and Groom received only $350,000 for the rights and an additional $250,000 from the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weinraub|first=Bernard|title='Gump,' a Huge Hit, Still Isn't Raking In Huge Profits?

''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)|Gone in 60 Seconds]]'' grossed $240 million at the box office, but the studio declared a $212 million loss, primarily through Hollywood accounting as explained on [[NPR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2010/05/the_friday_podcast_angelina_sh.html|title=We See Angelina's Bottom Line|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real figure is likely closer to $90 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2118819|title=Gross Misunderstanding: Forget about the box office.| author=Edward Jay Epstein|date=May 16, 2005|accessdate=2006-12-30|publisher=Slate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stan Lee]], co-creator of the character [[Spider-Man]], had a contract awarding him 10% of the net profits of anything based on his characters. The film ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' (2002) made more than $800 million in revenue, but the producers claim that it did not make any profit as defined in Lee's contract, and Lee received nothing. In 2002 he filed a [[lawsuit]] against [[Marvel Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawsuit filed by Spider-Man creator|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2458083.stm|accessdate=March 23, 2014|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=November 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was settled in January 2005, with Marvel paying $10 million to "finance past and future payments claimed by Mr. Lee."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/29/business/media/marvel-settles-with-a-spiderman-creator.html|title=Marvel Settles With a Spider-Man Creator|last=Ives|first=Nat|date=2005-04-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2002 film ''[[My Big Fat Greek Wedding]]'' was considered hugely successful for an independent film, yet according to the studio, the film lost money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=My Big Fat Greek Wedding: Most Profitable Independent Film in History, With Over $600 Million Worldwide Receipts, Supposedly Loses Over $20 Million|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/my-big-fat-greek-wedding-most-profitable-independent-film-in-history-with-over-600-million-worldwide-receipts-supposedly-loses-over-20-million-70743087.html|accessdate=March 23, 2014|newspaper=[[PR Newswire]]|date=July 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the cast (with the exception of [[Nia Vardalos]] who had a separate deal) sued the studio for their part of the profits. The original producers of the film have sued [[Gold Circle Films]] due to Hollywood accounting practices because the studio has claimed the film, which cost less than $6 million to make and made over $350 million at the box office, lost $20 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Munoz|first=Lorenza|title=Hanks sues over profit on 'Greek Wedding'|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/08/business/fi-hanks8|accessdate=March 23, 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Jackson]], director of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', and his studio [[Wingnut Films]], brought a lawsuit against [[New Line Cinema]] after an audit. Jackson stated this is regarding "certain accounting practices". In response, New Line stated that their rights to a film of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' were time-limited, and since Jackson would not work with them again until the suit was settled, he would not be asked to direct ''The Hobbit'', as had been anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=xoanon |url=http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2006/11/19/24053-peter-jackson-and-fran-walsh-talk-the-hobbit-2/ |title=Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh Talk THE HOBBIT |publisher=TheOneRing.net |date=November 19, 2006 |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen actors are suing New Line Cinema, claiming that they have never received their 5% of revenue from merchandise sold in relation to the movie, which contains their likenesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-06-06-rings-suit_N.htm |title=15 actors sue New Line Cinema over 'Lord of the Rings' profits |work=[[USA Today]] |date=June 6, 2007 |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Tolkien estate sued New Line, claiming that their contract entitled them to 7.5% of the gross receipts of the $6 billion hit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/02/11/financial/f115544S35.DTL&amp;tsp=1 The Associated Press: Tolkien Estate Sues New Line Cinema], February 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to New Line's accounts, the trilogy made "horrendous losses" and no profit at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10693123 |title=The Hollywood shell game |first=Karyn |last=Scherer |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |location=Auckland |date=December 13, 2010 |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Moore]] sued [[Bob Weinstein|Bob]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] in February 2011, claiming that they had used creative accounting to deprive him of his share of profits for the film ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''. Eventually, Moore reached a settlement with the Weinsteins and the lawsuit was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/michael-moore-harvey-weinstein-fahrenheit-911-lawsuit-291581 Michael Moore, Harvey Weinstein Settle 'Fahrenheit 9/11' Lawsuit], by Matthew Belloni, at [[The Hollywood Reporter]]; published February 15, 2012; retrieved March 23, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
