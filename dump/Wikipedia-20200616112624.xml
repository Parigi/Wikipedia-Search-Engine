[[Apple Inc.]] is a [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] American [[technology company]] which sells [[consumer electronics]] that have been claimed by critics to combine stolen&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Christoph Dernbach|title=Steve Jobs: Good artists copy great artists steal|date=2008-06-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CW0DUg63lqU&amp;hd=1|accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or purchased&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aaplinvestors.net/stats/acquisitions/|title=Mergers &amp; Acquisitions|website=aaplinvestors.net|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; designs that it claims are its own original creations. '''Criticism of Apple''' includes allegations of [[Business ethics|unethical business practices]] such as [[Anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive behavior]], rash litigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Orlowski |first=Andrew |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/04/apple_sa_deep_links/ |title=Apple sues itself in the foot (again) |publisher=The Register |date=May 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dubious [[#Tax practices|tax tactics]], their production methods involving the use of [[sweatshop]] labor,&lt;ref name="sweatshop2"&gt;{{citation |last=Musgrove |first=Mike |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/15/AR2006061501898.html |title=Sweatshop Conditions at IPod Factory Reported |work=The Washington Post |date=June 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sweatshop3"&gt;{{citation |last=Kahney |first=Leander |url=https://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2006/06/71138 |title=Judging Apple Sweatshop Charge|journal=Wired |date=June 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; customer service issues involving misleading warranties and insufficient [[data security]], and concerns about environmental destruction. Additionally, it has been criticized&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Orlowski |first=Andrew |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/09/13/apple_thinksecret/ |title=Apple shot first, asked question later, say sued sites |publisher=The Register |date=September 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flores, Marc, [http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2010/02/20/over-5000-apps-stricken-from-the-apple-app-store-new-rules-in-place/ Over 5000 apps stricken from the Apple app store, new rules in place], MobileCrunch, February 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; for its alleged collaboration with U.S. surveillance program, [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]].

Allegations against the company are varied, including:
* Thwarting smaller competitors
* Dishonest corporate policy
* [[E-waste]] and environmental destruction
* Financial affairs
* Harsh labor conditions and [[child labor]] accusations
* Collaborations with the U.S. government and the [[NSA]]

==Accusations of anti-competitive behavior==
===Vendor lock-in practices===
Apple has been criticized for the use of proprietary parts and [[Pentalobe screw|screws]] on their late MacBook models and recent iPhone products. In mid-2012, Apple introduced the [[Retina display]] MacBook Pro with a slimmer and lighter design. After its release, many criticized the new MacBook Pro design for introducing trade-offs such as [[RAM]] [[solder]]ed to the [[motherboard]], the battery being glued to the aluminum uni-body chassis, the LED screen being fused to the front glass, and the use of a proprietary [[PCI-E]] [[solid-state drive]] as opposed to a [[SATA]] interface. Many criticized these practices as a way for Apple to keep consumers out of the hardware they purchased, as well as eliminating [[Do it yourself|self-repair]] from the consumer.&lt;ref name="Why Apple’s Custom iPhone Screws Can’t Stop the DIY Community"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/08/if-theres-a-screw-theres-a-way-custom-screws-wont-stop-the-diy-community/|title=If There's a Screw, There's a Way: Custom Screws Won't Stop the DIY Community|magazine=Wired.com|accessdate=February 12, 2015|date=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacBook Pro Soldered Ram"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/13/3082514/macbook-pro-retina-display-ifixit-teardown|title=MacBook Pro with Retina display dismantled by iFixit, revealing soldered RAM|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge|accessdate=February 12, 2015|date=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[iFixit]], an electronics do-it-yourself website, named the 2012 Retina MacBook Pro "the least repairable notebook on the market."&lt;ref name="Retina MacBook Pro 'least-repairable' notebook ever, says iFixit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2504380/apple-mac/retina-macbook-pro--least-repairable--notebook-ever--says-ifixit.html|title=Retina MacBook Pro 'least-repairable' notebook ever, says iFixit|author=Gregg Keizer|date=June 14, 2012|work=Computerworld|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple has similarly faced controversy for the closed ecosystem surrounding its music store, iTunes;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7002612.stm|title=Time for Apple to face the music?|publisher=BBC News|date=September 19, 2007|first=Bill|last=Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, [[Steve Jobs]] was ordered to attend a court hearing regarding antitrust violations specifically with iPods and iTunes.&lt;ref name="apple monopoly"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coated.com/steve-jobs-ordered-to-attend-court-regarding-antitrust-case/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130119121640/http://www.coated.com/steve-jobs-ordered-to-attend-court-regarding-antitrust-case/ |archivedate=January 19, 2013 |df=mdy-all }},&lt;/ref&gt; Apple has not licensed its [[FairPlay]] [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]], or its formerly proprietary lossless format codec [[Apple Lossless]] (ALAC), to any other company, thus preventing content—either purchased from the iTunes store, or Apple Lossless encoded in the iTunes computer application or bought from non-iTunes sources—from being used on other manufacturers' devices. {{As of| April 2009}}, all music on the iTunes Store is DRM-free,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/139879/2009/04/itunes.html|title=iTunes is DRM-free, adds variable pricing|publisher=Macworld|first=Jim|last=Dalrymple|date=April 7, 2009|accessdate=July 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this does not apply to other content. The Apple Lossless (ALAC) codec was reverse-engineered and an independent encoder and decoder was released.&lt;ref name=ALAC-reverse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://craz.net/programs/itunes/alac.html |title=ALAC |publisher=Crazney.net |year=2004 |accessdate=June 27, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620124229/http://craz.net/programs/itunes/alac.html |archivedate=June 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Apple made the original ALAC source code available under the [[Apache license]].

===iTunes===
{{main|iTunes}}
Apple was caught up in controversy regarding the online sales of music in the [[European Union]] where, as a single market, customers are free to purchase goods and services from any member state. [[iTunes Store]]s there forced consumers and other music buyers to iTunes-only sites by restricting content purchases to the country from which the customers' payment details originated, which in turn forced users in some countries to pay higher prices. On December 3, 2004, the British [[Office of Fair Trading]] referred to the iTunes Music Store to the [[European Commission]] for violation of EU free-trade legislation. Apple commented that they did not believe they violated EU law, but were restricted by legal limits to the rights granted to them by the music labels and publishers. ''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'' commented that it appeared that ''"the Commission's main target is not Apple but the music companies and music rights agencies, which work on a national basis and give Apple very little choice but to offer national stores"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/130384/ |title=European Borders Fracture iTunes |publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |first=Martyn |last=Williams |date=April 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Google Voice controversy===
Apple has been criticized over attempting to prevent [[iPhone]] users from using the [[Google Voice]] application by disabling it on the iPhone. Apple declined to approve the Google application for use on the iPhone, claiming that the application altered iPhone intended functionality, i.e., that with Google voice installation, voicemail is no longer routed to the iPhone's native application [[Visual Voicemail]] but instead is routed through Google's application, thus "ruining" the iPhone [[user experience]]. This caused controversy among iPhone developers and users, and the United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) began investigating Apple's active decision to deny users' ability to install Google Voice from the Apple online store which is the only official way for users to download and install iPhone applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Kincaid |first=Jason |url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/07/31/fcc-takes-on-apple-and-att-over-google-voice-rejection/ |title=FCC Takes On Apple And AT&amp;T Over Google Voice Rejection |publisher=TechCrunch |date=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2010, Google Voice has been made available for the iPhone.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Gassert |first=Patrick |url=http://www.techieinsider.com/news/4016 |title=Google Voice Arrives For The iPhone |publisher=Techie Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adobe Flash prohibition on iOS===
{{main|Apple and Adobe Flash controversy}}
With the release of [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]] 4.0 [[Software development kit|SDK]], Apple changed its terms of service to prohibit programs that are originally written in non-Apple approved languages from being used on the iPhone. This was criticized for being anti-competitive&lt;ref&gt;Adobe Systems' [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634310000007/form_10q.htm#riskfactors SEC filing] alleging expected loss of ability to compete in the market because of Apple's position on Flash on the iPhone and iPad, Form 10q, March 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; by disallowing use of [[Adobe Animate]] (formerly Adobe Flash Professional) and other IDEs for creating iPhone apps.&lt;ref name="apple-slaps"&gt;{{citation |last=Brimelow |first=Lee |url=http://theflashblog.com/?p=1888 |title=Apple Slaps Developers In The Face |publisher=TheFlashBlog |date=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Williams |first=Hank |url=http://whydoeseverythingsuck.com/2010/04/steve-jobs-has-just-gone-mad.html |title=Steve Jobs Has Just Gone Mad |publisher=Why does everything suck? |date=April 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Schonfeld |first=Erick |url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/09/is-steve-jobs-ignoring-history-or-trying-to-rewrite-it/ |title=Is Steve Jobs Ignoring History, Or Trying To Rewrite It? |publisher=TechCrunch |date=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Times quoted an Adobe employee alleging the policy to be anti-competitive.&lt;ref name="apple-slaps"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Worthham |first=Jenna |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/technology/companies/13apple.html |title=Apple Places New Limits on App Developers |work=The New York Times |date=April 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 3, 2010, [[Ars Technica]] and The [[New York Post]] reported that the US [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) and the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ) are deciding which agency will launch an antitrust investigation into the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jacqui |last=Cheng |title=Apple iPhone OS compiler policy may lead to antitrust probe |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2010/05/apples-compiler-policy-may-land-it-in-hot-water-with-ftc/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=May 3, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Kosman |title=An antitrust app |url=https://nypost.com/2010/05/03/an-antitrust-app/ |website=[[New York Post]] |publisher=[[News Corp (2013–present)|News Corp]] |date=May 3, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy over Apple's changes to section 3.3.1 of the iPhone SDK license agreement erupted after John Gruber's April 8, 2010, Daring Fireball blog post entitled, New iPhone Developer Agreement Bans the Use of Adobe's Flash-to-iPhone.&lt;ref name="DaringFireball20100408"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/iphone_agreement_bans_flash_compiler|title=Daring Fireball: New iPhone Developer Agreement Bans the Use of Adobe's Flash-to-iPhone Compiler|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong opposition to Apple's licensing changes spread quickly with bloggers and others. Others were quick to note that the language used in the agreement also banned other developer tools including [[MonoTouch]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]], and many others.

The original iPhone OS 3 section 3.3.1 reads:
:3.3.1 Applications may only use Published APIs in the manner prescribed by Apple and must not use or call any unpublished or private APIs.&lt;ref name="DaringFireball20100408" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FactoryJoe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factoryjoe.pbworks.com/iPhone-Developer-Program-License-Agreement|title=Factory Joe / iPhone Developer Program License Agreement|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revised iPhone OS 4 section 3.3.1 reads:
:3.3.1 – Applications may only use Documented APIs in the manner prescribed by Apple and must not use or call any private APIs. Applications must be originally written in Objective-C, C, C++, or JavaScript as executed by the iPhone OS WebKit engine, and only code written in C, C++, and Objective-C may compile and directly link against the Documented APIs (e.g., Applications that link to Documented APIs through an intermediary translation or compatibility layer or tool are prohibited).&lt;ref name="DaringFireball20100408" /&gt;

Steve Jobs posted a reaction entitled "Thoughts on Flash",&lt;ref name="ThoughtsOnFlash"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/|title=Thoughts on Flash|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not directly address any third party development tools other than Adobe's Flash platform. The "Thoughts on Flash"&lt;ref name="ThoughtsOnFlash" /&gt; post drew immediate and harsh criticism with Steve Jobs being accused of outright lying by many.&lt;ref name="JobsLiesInThoughtsOnFlash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blixtsystems.com/2010/04/jobs-lies-in-thoughts-on-flash/|title=Jobs lies in "thoughts on Flash" - BlixtSystems|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DecodingSteveJobsDressingDownOfFlash"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/29/steve-jobs-apple-adobe-flash/|title=Decoding Steve Jobs' Dressing Down Of Flash|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SteveJobsIsLyingAboutFlash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-is-lying-about-flash-2010-4|title=Steve Jobs Is Lying About Flash|date=April 29, 2010|work=Business Insider|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SteveJobsOnFlashCorrectingTheLies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jessewarden.com/2010/04/steve-jobs-on-flash-correcting-the-lies.html|title=Steve Jobs on Flash: Correcting the Lies|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collusion with record labels===
In May 2015, it was reported that the U.S. Department of Justice and [[Federal Trade Commission]] were beginning to investigate Apple for engaging in a [[cartel]] with major record labels that discourage them from offering free, ad-supported streaming of their music online, in order to push users towards a re-launch of the subscription-based [[Beats Music]] service. In particular, it was alleged that Apple had pushed labels to pull their music from the freemium tier of competing service [[Spotify]] (a service which has cut into Apple's music sales revenue), and offered to pay [[Universal Music Group]] the equivalent of [[YouTube]]'s licensing fees with the label in exchange for pulling its content from the service.&lt;ref name="recode-applemusicfree"&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Music Labels Want to Make Free Music Hard to Get, and Apple Says They're Right|url=http://recode.net/2015/03/06/big-music-labels-want-to-make-free-music-hard-to-get-and-apple-says-theyre-right/|website=Re/code|accessdate=6 May 2015|date=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-freemusiccollusion"&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple pushing music labels to kill free Spotify streaming ahead of Beats relaunch|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/4/8540935/apple-labels-spotify-streaming|website=The Verge|accessdate=6 May 2015|date=2015-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== App Store transaction fee ===
[[iOS]] applications available through the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] that require payments for features or membership are required to use Apple's iTunes payments system, granting the company a 30% cut of all transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Chartier |title=Apple launches long-awaited subscriptions for App Store |url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1157927/app_store_subscriptions.html |website=[[Macworld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=February 15, 2011 |accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy has been criticized as taking an unreasonably large amount of money for each transaction, with comparisons being made to the typical 1-5% cut that credit card companies require&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Matt |last=Assay |title=Death by 30% cut: Apple app tax must change |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/02/18/the_payment_problem/ |website=[[The Register]] |publisher=Situation Publishing |date=February 18, 2011 |accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1-10% cut that some online marketplaces require.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jay |last=Yarow |title=How Apple's Decision To Collect 30% Of Every iOS App Sale Could Lead To Its Downfall |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/apples-ios-tax-2013-4 |website=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]] |date=April 18, 2013 |accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spotify ====
In July 2015, music-streaming service [[Spotify]] sent an email to its iOS subscribers, urging them to cancel their App Store subscriptions, wait for expiration, and then sign up for paid membership through Spotify's website, bypassing the 30% App Store transaction fee and making the service more affordable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Welch |title=Spotify urges iPhone customers to stop paying through Apple's App Store |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/8/8913105/spotify-apple-app-store-email |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=July 8, 2015 |accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately a year later, ''[[Recode]]'' reported that Spotify's general counsel Horacio Gutierrez had sent a letter to Apple's then-general counsel Bruce Sewell, saying that the company was "causing grave harm to Spotify and its customers" because it wouldn't approve an update to the Spotify app. Apple hadn't approved the new version due to "business model rules", requiring that Spotify use the iTunes payments system if it "wants to use the app to acquire new customers and sell subscriptions". Gutierrez severely criticized the chain of events, writing that "This latest episode raises serious concerns under both U.S. and EU competition law. ... It continues a troubling pattern of behavior by Apple to exclude and diminish the competitiveness of Spotify on iOS and as a rival to [[Apple Music]], particularly when seen against the backdrop of Apple's previous anticompetitive conduct aimed at Spotify."

=== Restriction of apps that compete with OS features ===
In November 2015, [[f.lux]], a popular computer program for adjusting a display's colors during night-time to remove blue-light that may affect sleep patterns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Erez |last=Zukerman |title=Review: f.lux makes your computer usable at night |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2056895/review-f-lux-makes-your-computer-usable-at-night.html |website=[[PC World]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=October 31, 2013 |accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was made available for iOS devices through "sideloading"; users install [[Xcode]], a development environment for Mac computers, and manually install the app on their iOS device, bypassing the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and the official release channels that do not grant required [[API|permissions]] for f.lux to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Rossignol |title=F.lux for iPhone and iPad Launches in Beta Outside of App Store |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2015/11/11/flux-iphone-ipad-sideloaded-app-xcode/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=November 11, 2015 |accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day later, the developers of f.lux made the sideloading app unavailable, having been contacted by Apple with information that such a procedure violates the Developer Program Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=F.lux for iOS No Longer Available After Apple Says Side-Loading Violates Developer Agreement |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2015/11/12/flux-for-ios-pulled-no-side-loading/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=November 12, 2015 |accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, an update to the iOS operating system enabled Apple's own "Night Shift" implementation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Releases iOS 9.3 With Night Shift, New Quick Actions, App Improvements, '1970' Bug Fix and More |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/21/apple-releases-ios-9-3/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=March 21, 2016 |accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Night Shift" feature was later expanded to the [[macOS]] operating system in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Releases macOS Sierra 10.12.4 With New Night Shift Mode |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/03/27/apple-releases-macos-sierra-10-12-4/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=March 27, 2017 |accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the iOS availability, the f.lux developers issued an official press release, praising Apple's efforts as "a big commitment and an important first step", though acknowledging itself as "the original innovators and leaders in this area". They also requested that Apple open up access for f.lux to enter the App Store, thereby supporting its mission in "furthering research in sleep and chronobiology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Response to Apple's announcement |url=https://justgetflux.com/news/2016/01/14/apple.html |website=[[f.lux]] |date=January 14, 2016 |accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Developers Behind F.lux Call on Apple to Allow F.lux App for iOS Devices |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2016/01/14/flux-asks-apple-to-allow-flux-ios-app/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=January 14, 2016 |accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the native macOS availability, an f.lux developer posted in its forums in March 2017 that the macOS version was more limited in its actual impact by not reducing the levels of blue light enough.

Similar criticisms emerged in 2019, when Apple was reported to have demanded changes or the removal of apps involving parental controls and device usage tracking; the latter had been introduced to [[iOS 12]] under the banner "Screen Time". After a report on the matter by ''[[The New York Times]]'', which stated that Apple had, "removed 11 to 17 of the most downloaded screen-time and parental-control apps,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/27/18519888/apple-screen-time-app-tracking-parental-controls-report|title=Apple explains why it's cracking down on third-party screen time and parental control apps|last=Liptak|first=Andrew|date=2019-04-27|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple stated that these demands were to due to privacy concerns surrounding their use of [[mobile device management]] features to gain system-level access—which it considered inappropriate outside of an enterprise setting, and a particular privacy risk to devices used by children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/27/technology/apple-screen-time-trackers.html|title=Apple Cracks Down on Apps That Fight iPhone Addiction|last=Nicas|first=Jack|date=2019-04-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90341325/apple-restricted-screen-time-like-apps-due-to-concerns-over-children-privacy|title=Apple restricted Screen Time-like apps due to concerns over children privacy|last=Grothaus|first=Michael|date=2019-04-29|website=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, the developers of the email app BlueMail sued Apple for patent infringement of its "Share Email" feature via [[Sign In with Apple]] (which uses automatic [[disposable e-mail]]s), and vaguely rejecting the app from the [[Mac App Store]] shortly after it announced the infringing feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/bluemail-developers-write-open-letter-to-apple-mac-app-store/|title=Email App Maker Begs Apple CEO to Get Back on the App Store|work=Wired|access-date=2019-11-28|language=en|issn=1059-1028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==App Store compensation conflict ==
In 2012, a group of Chinese writers won compensation from Apple for selling apps that contained unlicensed versions of their books. They had sought 50&amp;nbsp;million yuan ($7.7&amp;nbsp;million) in compensation but were awarded only $160,400.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/business/apple-china-copyright-fine-012/|title=Apple fined by Chinese court over pirated books in Apps Store|work=rt.com|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==John Wiley &amp; Sons and ''iCon: Steve Jobs''==
In 2005, [[Steve Jobs]] banned all books published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] from the [[Apple Store|Apple retail stores]] in response to their publishing an [[unauthorized biography]], ''[[iCon: Steve Jobs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Steve Jobs's Review of His Biography: Ban It |last=Hafner |first=Katie |work=The New York Times |date=April 30, 2005 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/30/technology/30apple.html |accessdate=October 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Book giant feels wrath of Jobs |last=Orlowski |first=Andrew |work=[[The Register]]  |date=April 27, 2005 |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/04/27/apple_snubs_wiley/ |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book received criticism for "failing to cohesively and clearly express the opinion of Jobs, linguistic redundancies, and clumsy anecdotes." However, despite the criticisms of the quality of Jeffrey S. Young and William L. Simon's writing and the attempts to highlight Steve Jobs's "negative" characteristics as a boss and individual, thought leader Dan Sumption admitted that the book was a relatively entertaining view into the life of Steve Jobs.&lt;ref name="Dan Sumption 'iCon' Book Review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sumption|first=Dan|title=Review of iCon - Steve Jobs, The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business by Jeffrey S.

==Price reductions==
Apple has been criticized for post-launch price reductions, most notably after the price of the original [[iPhone]] was cut by $200 just two months after its release. This quick drop in price resulted in many complaints to Apple.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, Chris. [http://businessethicsblog.com/2007/09/07/were-iphone-early-adopters-abused/ Were iPhone Early-Adopters "Abused?"], The Business Ethics Blog.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuaw.com/2007/09/05/apple-screwed-you-so-now-what/|title=Apple screwed you: So now what?|work=TUAW: Apple news, reviews and how-tos since 2004|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple worked to rectify complaints by offering $100 store credit to early iPhone customers who had bought their iPhones from Apple or AT&amp;T.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/hotnews/openiphoneletter/|title=Apple - To all iPhone customers|publisher=Apple, Inc.|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2007/09/14/iphones-100-apple-store-credit-program-goes-live/ ''iPhone's $100 Apple Store Credit program goes live''], [[Engadget]], September 14, 2009. This pricing strategy used by Apple Inc. is known as "Penetration Pricing".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media relations==
Apple has also been criticized for its methods of tightly controlling information regarding product launches, deliberately passing out misinformation in an effort to find leakers and keep the media unsure of [[Apple Inc.]]'s current developments.&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;{{citation |last=Stone |first=Brad |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/technology/23apple.html?_r=2 |title=Apple's Obsession With Secrecy Grows Stronger |work=New York Times |date=June 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Apple's methods result in more hype surrounding product launches. In some cases, Apple deliberately leaks information to the public to gauge potential viability of products such as the [[iPad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Appleinsider Staff |url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/01/06/former_apple_marketing_manager_describes_companys_controlled_leaks.html |title=Former Apple marketing manager describes company's 'controlled leaks' |publisher=Appleinsider |date=January 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many attribute Apple's secrecy to [[Steve Jobs]]' reclusive nature where "he has always kept things close to the vest...and only confided in relatively few people."&lt;ref name="Stone"/&gt;

===Think Secret lawsuit===

{{further|Think Secret|Apple v. Does}}
With regard to leaked information about new Apple products, Apple has been accused of pressuring journalists to release their sources, has filed lawsuits against unknown persons, "[[Apple v.

Superior Court, 140 Cal.App.4th 675b.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Apple fought a protracted battle against the [[Think Secret]] website that resulted in a "positive solution for both sides". No sources were revealed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/12/20/apple_closes_thinksecret/ Apple mugs Think Secret], [[The Register]]. Retrieved August 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gizmodo incident===
In April 2010, [[Gizmodo]] editor Jason Chen became the subject of legal controversy in [[San Mateo, California]], when the California Rapid Enforcement Allied Computer Team—a multi-county task force that investigates high-tech crimes in the Silicon Valley area, of whose steering committee Apple is a member—seized computers from the editor's home office, ostensibly to investigate the [[reverse-engineering]] of an iPhone prototype. Prior to its discovery in a bar, the device had been in the possession of an Apple employee celebrating a birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Keizer|first = G.|date = 2010-04-30|title = Lawyer confirms identity of 'lost' iPhone seller|url = https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/apple/lawyer-confirms-identity-lost-iphone-seller-3222243/|newspaper = Macworld UK|accessdate = 2019-09-20|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Duan|first = M.|date = 2009-05-17|title = Valley REACTs to Craigslist counterfeits|url = https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2009/05/18/story2.html|newspaper = San Jose Business Journal|accessdate = 2019-09-20|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gizmodo blog published an article the week prior about the iPhone product's future, including a product dissection, after Chen's purchase of a misplaced iPhone device.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Jason, [https://gizmodo.com/5520164/this-is-apples-next-iphone ''This is Apple's Next iPhone''], Gizmodo blog, April 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labor practices==
Many reports allege that [[sweatshop]] conditions existed in factories in China, where the contract manufacturers, [[Foxconn]] and [[Inventec]], operate the factories that produce the iPod. One iPod factory, as an example, employed over 200,000 workers who lived and worked in the factory, and regularly performed more than 60 hours of labor per week. The article also reported that workers made around US$100 per month and were required to live on the premises and pay for rent and food from the company. Living expenses—a requirement of keeping the job—typically required that employees spend a little over half of their earnings. The article also said that workers were given buckets to wash their clothes in.&lt;ref name="sweatshop2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sweatshop3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sweatshop4"&gt;{{citation |last=Dean |first=Jason |url=https://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB118677584137994489.html?mod=blog |title=The Forbidden City of Terry Gou |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=August 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the allegation, Apple launched an investigation and worked with their manufacturers to ensure that conditions were acceptable by its standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Morphy |first=Ericka |url=http://www.macnewsworld.com/story/61454.html |title=Apple, IT and the Specter of Sweatshop Labor |publisher=Mac New World |date=January 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Apple started yearly audits of the labor conditions of all its suppliers, slowly raising standards and severing relationships with suppliers that did not comply—yearly progress reports have also been published since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://images.apple.com/supplierresponsibility/pdf/L418102A_SR_2010Report_FF.pdf|title=Apple - Supplier Responsibility|work=Apple|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, workers in China planned to sue iPhone contractors over poisoning from a cleaner used to clean LCD screens. One worker claimed that they were not informed of possible occupational illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/05/wintek-employees-sue/ |title=Workers Plan to Sue iPhone Contractor Over Poisoning |journal=Wired |first=Brian X. |last=Chen |date=May 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 BBC investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted, despite Apple's promise to reform factory practice after the 2010 [[Foxconn suicides]]. The Pegatron factory was once again the subject of review, as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees. While the BBC maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing since 2010, Apple publicly disagreed with the BBC and stated: "We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions".&lt;ref name="Fire"&gt;{{cite news|title=Apple under fire again for working conditions at Chinese factories|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/19/apple-under-fire-again-for-working-conditions-at-chinese-factories?CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2|accessdate=December 20, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period following these exposures, Apple has continued to receive criticism for its labor rights record. Reports in 2015 and 2016 from the labor rights organization, China Labor Watch, noted that Apple's supplier Pegatron's wages were too low to cover living costs by themselves, forcing workers to put in excessive amounts of overtime hours in order to make ends meet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinalaborwatch.org/report/113|title=Study Casts Doubts on Apple's Ethical Standards|work=China Labor Watch|date=February 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinalaborwatch.org/report/109|title=Poor Working Conditions Persist at Apple Supplier Pegatron|work=China Labor Watch|date=October 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety problems and harsh working conditions===
Workers who assemble iPhones, iPads, and other devices often labor under harsh conditions, according to employees inside the Foxconn plants. According to company reports and advocacy, Apple's suppliers in China have improperly disposed of hazardous waste and falsified records.&lt;ref name="York"&gt;{{cite news|last=DUHIGG|first=CHARLES|title=In China, Human Costs Are Built Into an iPad|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/26/business/ieconomy-apples-ipad-and-the-human-costs-for-workers-in-china.html?_r=1&amp;|accessdate=November 20, 2013|work=The New York Times|date=January 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forty-nine young men and women were poisoned at the Lianjian Technology factory in Suzhou Industrial Park by the toxic chemical [[hexane]], used to wipe clean the iPad display screens and speed up efficiency. To save money, the factory did not provide proper ventilation during the cleaning process, and workers developed neurological problems, the loss of motor function, numb limbs, and complained of constantly fainting and being overcome by a debilitating fatigue. Some of these sick workers were eventually bought off with a lump payment of 8,000 or 9,000 yuan (US$1,200–$1,400), but only after signing an agreement stating they would not bring claims against Apple or its supplier companies in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Litzinger|first=Ralph|title=Labor in China: A New Politics of Struggle|journal=South Atlantic Quarterly|year=2013|volume=112|pages=172–178|doi=10.1215/00382876-1891314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An explosion in May 2011 at a Foxconn iPad factory in Chengdu, China, killed four people and injured 18. Employees worked excessive overtime—in some cases, seven days a week—and lived in crowded dorms. Some said they stand so long that their legs swell until they can hardly walk.&lt;ref name="York" /&gt;

===Student and child labor abuses===
Foxconn's use of students and minors is part of its pursuit of low-cost, flexible labor. When the fallout of the 2010 suicides left Foxconn with a labor shortage, the [[Henan]] provincial government assisted with the breach. The province directed 100,000 vocational students to staff the [[Shenzhen]] assembly lines as "interns" (the Chinese term ''shixi'' can also mean "trainee") after providing them with nine days’ notice. Students were told that those who failed to comply would not be allowed to graduate.

Interns have become a significant component of Foxconn's labor force, constituting as high as 15 percent of the workforce—or 180,000 interns company-wide—at peak times, making it the largest "internship" program in the world. Teachers have been stationed in the factory compound to monitor attendance, and some interns have been as young as 14—by the company's own admission—thereby violating Chinese laws. According to SACOM's Chan, Foxconn, and other similar manufacturers, are "covertly" using interns to avoid detection and culpability. The young people are hired through the same labor agencies that hire Foxconn's "dispatch workers," who are deprived of standard benefits and protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perlin|first=Ross|title=Chinese Workers Foxconned|journal=Dissent|year=2013|volume=60|issue=2|pages=46–52|doi=10.1353/dss.2013.0024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US-based China Labour Watch (CLW) investigated into conditions at three factories operated by Pegatron, which makes equipment for Apple computers and iPhones, and found that Pegatron hired children under the age of 18—the child laborers worked under the same poor conditions as adult staff. In total, 10,000 employees aged between 16 and 20 worked in crowded production rooms, performing the same tasks as adults. Some of the children were paid less, and others did not have their wages paid on time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=ARMITAGE|first=JIM ARMITAGE|title='Even worse than Foxconn': Apple rocked by child labour claims|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/even-worse-than-foxconn-apple-rocked-by-child-labour-claims-8736504.html|location=London|work=The Independent|date=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apple–Foxconn business relationship===
Apple's considerable commercial success is partly attributable to the outsourcing of its consumer electronics production to Asia. As the principal manufacturer of products and components for Apple, Taiwanese company Foxconn employed 1.4 million China-based workers in 2013. The workers are part of China's "floating population" of 200 million migrants, at the bottom of what Taiwanese tech entrepreneur Stan Shih calls "the smiling curve." Controlling the upturned edges of the smile—brand, design, and engineering on one side, and marketing, sales, and external relations on the other—is what ensures major profit margins.&lt;ref name="New"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chan|first=Jenny|author2=Ngai Pun |author3=Mark Selden |title=The politics of global production: Apple, Foxconn and China's new working class|journal=New Technology, Work and Employment|year=2013|volume=28|issue=2|pages=104–105|doi=10.1111/ntwe.12008|url=https://zenodo.org/record/999782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple, Foxconn and China's workers are stakeholders in high-technology production, but relations between the three are perceived by analysts as imbalanced. Apple was able to capture 58.5 percent of the value of the iPhone, despite the fact that the manufacture of the product is entirely outsourced. Particularly notable is that labor costs in China account for the smallest share: 1.8 percent, or nearly US$10, of the US$549 retail price. While both Apple and Foxconn rely on Chinese workers to perform 12-hour working days to meet demand, the costs of Chinese labor in processing and assembly are insignificant in the overall commercial success of Apple. Other major component providers—such as Samsung and LG—captured slightly over 14 percent of the value of the iPhone, while the cost of raw materials was just over one-fifth of the total value (21.9 percent).&lt;ref name="New" /&gt;

Wages average from $1 to $2 an hour for Foxconn workers, including overtime, and are dependent upon location—such rates are attractive by China's rural standards. Foxconn workers typically complete 50-hour work weeks and 12-hour shifts; however, work weeks of up to 100 hours are not unheard of during peak production periods. Foxconn workers typically cannot afford the iPads and iPhones they assemble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perlin|first=Ross|title=Chinese Workers Foxconned|journal=Dissent|year=2013|volume=60|issue=2|pages=49–52|doi=10.1353/dss.2013.0024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 and 2010, the Foxconn factories at the Foxconn City industrial park in Longhua, [[Shenzhen]], China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Life Inside Foxconn's Facility in Shenzhen|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2012/12/19/life-inside-foxconns-facility-in-shenzhen/|accessdate=December 21, 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|author=Paul Mozur|date=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; were heavily criticized in the press, with one source describing conditions as a "white collar prison."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-its-like-to-work-if-chinas-gadget-sweatshops-where-your-iphones-and-ipads-are-made-2010-4 |title=What It's Like To Work In China's Gadget Sweatshops Where Your iPhones And iPads Are Made |last=Carlson |first=Nicholas |date=April 7, 2010 |work=[[Business Insider]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Foxconn guards were videotaped beating employees.&lt;ref name="wsjfoxsui"/&gt;

An Apple spokesman told reporters that the company was "saddened by the tragic loss of this young employee."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/a/-/newshome/5743721 |title=Worker commits suicide over misplaced iPhone |publisher=Yahoo!

Apple policy on how it influences the corporate culture of its suppliers is presented in the "Supplier Responsibility Progress Reports" document.&lt;ref name="ProgRpt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://images.apple.com/supplierresponsibility/pdf/L418102A_SR_2010Report_FF.pdf|title=Apple - Supplier Responsibility|work=Apple|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holding suppliers accountable for their errors and omissions in their relationship with Apple is an area of concern Apple takes seriously. In one report, Apple stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;
[our] procurement decisions take into account a facility's social responsibility performance, along with factors such as quality, cost, and timely delivery. When social responsibility performance consistently fails to meet Apple expectations, we terminate business.&lt;ref name="ProgRpt" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Given Apple's stated policy at the time of the death, terminating relationships with such suppliers was potentially difficult without incurring huge financial losses.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Malcolm, [http://expressbuzz.com/tech/big-suppliers-in-china-hold-sway-over-apple/154133.html ''Big suppliers in China hold sway over Apple'']{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Express Buzz, March 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in April 2010, four workers committed suicide in a single month in the same factory, signifying the beginning of the 2010 "Foxconn suicides" incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-another-apple-supplier-factory-worker-tries-to-kill-herself-thats-4-in-4-weeks-2010-4 |title=Apple-Supplier Factory Worker Tries To Kill Herself – That's 4 In 4 Weeks |last=Blodget |first=Harry |date=April 7, 2010 |work=[[Business Insider]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 2010, 12 workers had committed suicide at Foxconn's operations in China - although the number of suicides was lower than the general suicide rate in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16231588|title=Suicides at Foxconn: Light and death|publisher=Economist|date=May 27, 2010|accessdate=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple, HP, and others stated that they were investigating the situation.&lt;ref name="wsjDeaTsa20100527"/&gt; A total of 18 suicide attempts were recorded at the Foxconn facility in 2010, with 14 attempts resulting in deaths.&lt;ref name=tian&gt;{{cite news | title=Struggle for Foxconn girl who wanted to die | work=South China Morning Post | date=December 15, 2010 | author=Lau, Mimi | location=Wuhan, Hubei}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scmpreport"&gt;{{cite news | title=Foxconn factories are labour camps: report | work=South China Morning Post | date=October 11, 2010 | author=Tam, Fiona}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters3"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6A41M920101105|title=Foxconn worker plunges to death at China plant: report|publisher=Reuters|date=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- 6:05&amp;nbsp;am EDT --&gt;

In the late 1980s Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique, "[[Double Irish arrangement|Double Irish]] With a [[Dutch Sandwich]]", which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean. In 2004,&lt;ref group=Note name=Note01/&gt; Ireland, a nation of less than 5 million, was home to more than one-third of Apple's worldwide revenues, according to company filings. Robert Promm, Apple's controller in the mid-1990s, called the strategy "the worst-kept secret in Europe".&lt;ref name="NYT-tax"&gt;{{cite news|last=CHARLES DUHIGG|first=DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI|title=How Apple Sidesteps Billions in Taxes|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/business/apples-tax-strategy-aims-at-low-tax-states-and-nations.html |publisher=The NY Times|accessdate=May 20, 2013|date=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such strategies helped Apple keep its international taxes to 3.2 percent of foreign profits last year, to 2.2 percent in 2010, and in the single digits for the last half-decade, according to the company's corporate filings.&lt;ref name="NYT-tax"/&gt;

According to a Senate report on the company's offshore tax structure concluded in May 2013, Apple has held billions of dollars in profits in Irish subsidiaries to pay little or no taxes to any government by using an unusual global tax structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Levin |first=Carl |last2=McCain |first2=John |date=May 2013 |title=Memorandum: Offshore profit shifting and the U.S. tax code - Part 2 (Apple Inc.) |type=memorandum of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations |url=http://levin.senate.gov/download/exhibit1a_profitshiftingmemo_apple |accessdate=June 27, 2013 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629090950/http://www.levin.senate.gov/download/exhibit1a_profitshiftingmemo_apple |archivedate=June 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main subsidiary, a holding company that includes Apple's retail stores throughout Europe, has not paid any corporate income tax in the last five years.

==Quality control and customer service issues==
The Danish Consumer Complaints Board reported a fault with Apple's [[iBook]] product line and criticized Apple's response to the issue, indicating customer support problems at Apple.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, Nick,{{cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/en/inquirer/news/2007/05/04/danes-prove-apple-ibook-g4-has-a-defect |title=Danes prove Apple iBook G4 has a defect, Apple still denies it |accessdate=August 10, 2008 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002070613/http://www.theinquirer.net/en/inquirer/news/2007/05/04/danes-prove-apple-ibook-g4-has-a-defect |archivedate=October 2, 2007 }} , the Inquirer, May 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, a solder joint between two components fractured after a certain number of computer restarts causing the computer to break down, with most incidents occurring outside Apple's warranty period. Websites such as AppleDefects.com were created in response to the issue and detailed [[quality control]] issues with Apple's product portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jacqui |last=Cheng |title=Quality control problems or growing pains at Apple? |url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/08/7457/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=August 9, 2006 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple has been repeatedly criticized for its unwillingness to honor its warranties and its concomitant penchant for giving any reason for doing so, no matter how bizarre: in 2008, Apple repair centers began to refuse to honor warranties of its products which had been used in an environment it deemed hazardous, i.e., that had been used around someone who smokes;&lt;ref&gt;Erik Sherman, Erik, [https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505124_162-43441952/smoking-hazardous-to-apple-equipment-or-at-least-warranty/ Smoking Hazardous to Apple Equipment, Or, at Least, Warranty], CBS News, November 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Metz, Cade, [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/11/22/apple_allegedly_voids_smokers_warranties/ Apple voids warranties over cigarette smoke, users say No repairs for 'biohazard' Macs], The Register, November 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Northrup, Laura, [http://consumerist.com/2009/11/smoking-near-apple-computers-creates-biohazard-voids-warranty.html ''Smoking Near Apple Computers Creates Biohazard, Voids Warranty''], Consumerist, November 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2009, Apple refused to honor its warranty and replace a defective battery on a machine that had a small amount of unrelated cosmetic damage that did not affect the machine's functionality, nor that of its battery.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Carey, [http://consumerist.com/2009/03/apple-cosmetic-damage-keeps-us-from-replacing-your-battery.html ''Apple: Cosmetic Damage Keeps Us From Replacing Your Battery!''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308003955/http://consumerist.com/2009/03/apple-cosmetic-damage-keeps-us-from-replacing-your-battery.html |date=March 8, 2012 }}, Consumerist, March 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data security===
Despite the existence of a small number of known viruses and [[malware]] designed for Apple products, a 2006 report by [[McAfee]] found a 228 percent increase in the annual rate of vulnerabilities in the period 2003-5, compared to Microsoft's products, which saw only 73 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downloadcenter.mcafee.com/products/mcafee-avert/whitepapers/newappleofmalwareseye.pdf|title=The new Apple of Malware's Eye: Is Mac OS X the next Windows?|year=2006|accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, every year since then a significant number of vulnerabilities have been found and fixed through security updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2006/12/january_2007_month_of_apple_bu.html|title=Month of Apple Bugs|date=December 19, 2006 |accessdate=July 6, 2010 | work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/apple-plugs-48-security-holes-safari-browser-060810|title=Apple Plugs 48 Security Holes in Safari Browser|date=June 8, 2010|accessdate=July 6, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623113809/http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/apple-plugs-48-security-holes-safari-browser-060810|archivedate=June 23, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Apple-Patches-23-Security-Holes-in-Mac-OS-X-Leopard-Snow-Leopard-144694.shtml|title=Apple Patches 23 Security Holes in Mac OS X Leopard, Snow Leopard|date=June 16, 2010 |accessdate=July 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/05/apple_patches_40_security_hole_1.html|title=Apple Patches 23 Security Holes in Mac OS X Leopard, Snow Leopard|date=May 29, 2008 |accessdate=July 6, 2010 | work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the public's lack of awareness of the security vulnerabilities of Apple products has led to criticism of Apple for misleading the public which has risen over the years.&lt;ref name="Veiga2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Viega|first=J.|title=The Myths of Security: What the Computer Security Industry Doesn't Want You to Know|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|year=2009|url=https://archive.org/details/mythsofsecurityw0000vieg|url-access=registration|isbn=978-0-596-52302-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2010/06/17/technology/apple_security/|title=Apple is the new hacker bulls-eye|date=June 17, 2010|accessdate=July 6, 2010 |publisher=CNN | first=David | last=Goldman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Winkler"/&gt; This criticism has also drawn attention to Apple's failure to update its products with security updates in a timely fashion. An example of this was a security flaw in [[Sun Microsystems]]'s Java, which Sun fixed promptly, while Apple took more than five months to distribute the fix. That is much longer than other companies, and drew sharp criticism from experts and journalists.&lt;ref name="Winkler"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/140793/2009/05/macsecurity.html|title=It's time for the FTC to investigate Mac security|date=May 26, 2009|accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/140704/2009/05/java_vulnerability.html|title=Apple lags on Java security fix in OS X|date=May 20, 2009|accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9133350/Angered_by_Apple_delay_hacker_posts_Mac_Java_attack_code|title=Angered by Apple delay, hacker posts Mac Java attack code|date=May 20, 2009|accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent example is a malware product called [[Mac Defender|MacDefender]], MacProtector, MacSecurity, or MacGuard, which is an application that can be installed in OS X by the user; ZDNet's Microsoft Blogger Ed Bott estimates that it has been installed by 60,000 to 120,000 Mac customers who thought it was legitimate anti-virus software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/05/apple-malware/|title=Apple Promises Software Update to Kill 'MacDefender' Malware|accessdate=May 26, 2011 | work=Wired|first=Brian X.|last=Chen|date=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, experts admit that Apple products are less likely to be breached by a hacker or infected by a virus/malware, though they emphasize that this is mainly due to the lack of interest by hackers in attacking Apple products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuaw.com/2010/03/20/20-zero-day-security-holes-in-mac-os-x-to-be-revealed/|title=20 zero-day security holes in Mac OS X to be revealed|date=May 20, 2009|accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silicon.com/technology/security/2009/08/27/apples-mac-os-lagging-behind-vista-on-security-39501473/|title=Apple's Mac OS 'lagging behind Vista on security|date=August 27, 2009|accessdate=July 9, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106171502/http://www.silicon.com/technology/security/2009/08/27/apples-mac-os-lagging-behind-vista-on-security-39501473/|archivedate=January 6, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular they fear that Apple places its clients in danger by not taking action to inform the public of its security vulnerabilities. As David Harley, security expert from anti-virus vendor ESET said, "Any computer user who believes a system is so safe that they don't have to care about security is prime material for exploitation by social engineering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serverwatch.com/eur/article.php/3888941/Apple-vs-Microsoft-Patch-Management-Polar-Opposites.htm|title=Apple vs. Microsoft: Patch Management Polar Opposites|date=June 22, 2010|accessdate=July 6, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101071625/http://www.serverwatch.com/eur/article.php/3888941/Apple-vs-Microsoft-Patch-Management-Polar-Opposites.htm|archivedate=January 1, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Secunia vulnerability rankings, Apple has led Microsoft in reported security vulnerabilities since 2007, and currently leads all other vendors in reported vulnerabilities for 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://secunia.com/gfx/pdf/Secunia_Half_Year_Report_2010.pdf|title=Secunia Half Year Report 2010|date=July 10, 2010|accessdate=July 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ranking, however, doesn't "indicate the actual security (or lack thereof) in the different vendors' products; it rather shows that vulnerabilities continue to be discovered in significant numbers in products from even the largest and most popular vendors including those who spend significant resources on improving the security of their products" according to the authors of the study.

In August 2014, it was publicized that hackers had discovered an exploit involving the [[Find My iPhone]] service, which allowed them to [[brute-force attack|brute-force]] a user's Apple ID and access their iCloud data. The exploit was later believed to have been used as part of [[August 2014 celebrity photos leak|an August 2014 leak]] of a large number of private, mostly nude photos of celebrities that had been synced into their iCloud storage.&lt;ref name="verge-icloudhack"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reported iCloud hack leaks hundreds of nude celebrity photos|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/1/6092089/nude-celebrity-hack|website=The Verge|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-celebgate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple 'actively investigating' and FBI 'addressing' alleged hack that revealed nude celebrity photos|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/1/6094423/apple-actively-investigating-alleged-hack-nude-celebrity-jennifer-lawrence|website=The Verge|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="engadget-findmyiphoneexploit"&gt;{{cite web|title='Find My iPhone' exploit may be to blame for celebrity photo hacks (update)|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/09/01/find-my-iphone-exploit/|website=Engadget|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple has since denied that the iCloud service itself or the alleged exploit was responsible for the leak, asserting that the leaks were the result of a "very targeted" brute-force attack of iCloud account information.&lt;ref name="verge-iclouddenied"&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple denies iCloud breach in celebrity nude photo hack|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/2/6098107/apple-denies-icloud-breach-celebrity-nude-photo-hack|website=The Verge|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 8, 2018, a search warrant was granted to the FBI to search the property of [https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/09/30/feds-force-suspect-to-unlock-apple-iphone-x-with-their-face/#76686eb61259 Grant Michalski] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/09/30/feds-force-suspect-to-unlock-apple-iphone-x-with-their-face/|title=Feds Force Suspect To Unlock An Apple iPhone X With Their Face|last=Brewster|first=Thomas|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was accused of sending and receiving child pornography.

On December 27, 2011, Apple was fined a total of €900,000 by the [[Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato|Italian Antitrust Authority]] for failing to properly inform customers of their legal right to two years of warranty service under Italy's Consumer Code. According to the Italian agency Apple only disclosed its own standard one-year warranty and offered to sell customers AppleCare for one additional year instead of abiding by the law.

===China===
On March 15, 2013, [[China Central Television]] aired a program for the World Consumer Rights Day. The program criticized the issue associated with Apple warranty issues in China.

===Timeline of Apple's recorded environmental progress===
Apple provides a section of their website, titled "Apple and the Environment," which includes a timeline of their progression.&lt;ref name="AppleWebsite"&gt;{{cite web|last=Apple Inc.|title=Environmental Progress|url=https://www.apple.com/environment/progress/|publisher=Apple Inc.|work=Apple Inc.|accessdate=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to their website, Apple starts their timeline in 1990, though the Apple company was founded in 1976.

In 1990, Apple officially released and implemented its environmental policy, while in 1991, a phase-out of lead in batteries began. In 1992, Apple officially became a founding member of the U.S. EPA ENERGY STAR program, which was developed to identify and promote energy-efficient computers and monitors. During this time, there was also a phase-out of chlorofuorocarbons (CFCs) in Apple manufacturing, which are substances that deplete the ozone layer. In 1994, there was also a phase-out of nickel-cadmium batteries, while in 1995, PVC in packaging materials was phased out as well. The first Apple manufacturing site in Sacramento, California became ISO 14001 certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=International Organization for Standardization|title=ISO 14000-Environmental Management|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso14000.htm|publisher=ISO|work=International Organization for Standardization|accessdate=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISO 14001:2004 set the criteria for an environmental management system, mapping out a framework that a company or an organization can use. If one chooses to use ISO 14001:2004, it can provide assurance to company management and employees as well as external stakeholders that environmental impact is being measured and improved. The benefits of using ISO 14001:2004 are reduced cost of waste management, saving in consumption of energy and materials, lower distribution costs, and improved corporate image among regulators, customers, and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees (TCO)|title=Ecology, Energy, Ergonomics and Emissions|url=http://www.wedophones.com/Manuals/AppleComputer/Ecology,%20Energy,%20Ergonomics%20and%20Emissions.pdf|publisher=Apple Computer, Inc.|work=The Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees|accessdate=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While this was a big step for Apple, their concern for environmental well-being has continued to grow. In 1997, the first Apple products were tested for conformity to TCO Certified standards. TCO Certified standards involve requirements that cover a variety of issues: environment, ergonomics, usability, emission of electrical and magnetic fields, and energy consumption, and electrical fire safety. For example, environmental demands restrict the use of heavy metals, chlorinated solvents, and other various things. Mainly, products that are labeled must meet these environmental demands.
Two years after Apple agreed to meet TCO Certified's standards, in 1999, Apple introduced "Apple Product Environmental Specifications (APES) files," in which lead and cadmium in cables were restricted. Shortly after, in 2000, all of Apple's manufacturing sites became ISO 14001 certified worldwide. This accredited that Apple had a structured environmental management system (EMS) in order to manage the environmental impact of their operations.&lt;ref name=AppleWebsite /&gt;

In 2001, Apple computers and displays first met ENERGY STAR requirements,&lt;ref name="AppleWebsite" /&gt; in which they voluntarily phased out tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) in all their plastic enclosure parts greater than 25 grams. They also began to purchase 100 percent of electricity for the Austin facility from renewable sources, called Austin's "Green Choice" Power Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Austin Energy|title=Greenchoice Renewable Energy|url=http://www.austinenergy.com/energy%20efficiency/Programs/Green%20Choice/|publisher=Austin Energy|work=Austin Energy|accessdate=November 19, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131129110814/http://www.austinenergy.com/energy%20efficiency/Programs/Green%20Choice/|archive-date=November 29, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Apple continued to build a more environmentally friendly effort. For example, Apple signed the European Union Code of Conduct on Power Supplies, which encourages manufacturers to design power supplies that minimize energy consumption in "off" mode. In 2004, there was a phaseout of substances included in the European Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive was initiated. Importantly noted, The Apple Supplier Code of Conduct was implemented in 2005, and in 2006, Apple was the first computer manufacturer to replace CRT displays with material-efficient and energy-efficient LCDs.&lt;ref name="AppleWebsite" /&gt;

In 2008, Apple introduced the unibody MacBook and MacBook Pro, which is made with recyclable aluminum and glass enclosures with arsenic and mercury-free displays.&lt;ref name="AppleWebsite" /&gt; It is also made with PVC-free internal components. The MacBook Air was the first Mac to use mercury-free backlight technology with arsenic-free LCD display glass. Along with that, the iPhone 3G shipped with PVC-free handset, headphones, and USB cables; BFR-free printed circuit boards; and a mercury and arsenic-free display. Apple achieved a recycling rate of 41.9%.&lt;ref name="AppleWebsite" /&gt;

In 2009, Apple revealed a complete life cycle analysis of greenhouse gas emissions, which set a new standard of full environmental disclosure. Apple is the only company in the industry that publishes the environmental footprint of each of its products. Other companies only report on a fraction of their emissions. All of their products became BFR-free with shipping and mercury-free LED-backlit displays with arsenic-free display glass. The Mac mini, iMac, and Mac Pro met the ENERGY STAR 5.0 specification.&lt;ref name="AppleWebsite" /&gt;

In 2010, all displays that were offered by Apple became mercury-free and used arsenic-free display glass.&lt;ref name="AppleWebsite" /&gt; Apple introduced the Apple Battery charger for rechargeable batteries, which reduces battery waste by 78% and the carbon footprint by 63% over a four-year period. Also, Apple introduced the Mac mini, which was the world's most energy-efficient desktop computer, because it can operate on 10 watts of electricity (which is less power than a single energy-efficient CFL lightbulb). By this time, Apple also began to build facilities in Cork, Ireland; Austin, Texas; and Sacramento, California, and converted to using 100% renewable energy.&lt;ref name="AppleWebsite" /&gt;

In 2011, Apple introduced iTunes cards that use 100% recyclable paper, and they also introduced the Mac App Store in 123 countries. Delivering digital downloads reduces the environmental impact of delivering software by eliminating the packaging and transportation. Apple also eliminates restore DVDs that were previously included in Mac product packaging.&lt;ref name="AppleWebsite" /&gt;

Finally, in 2012, Apple launched the redesigned iMac, using 68% less material and generating 67% fewer carbon emissions than earlier generations. Also, the aluminum stand on the iMac is made using 30% recycled content. Meanwhile, at their headquarters in Cupertino, energy use was cut by over 30%, and Apple provided a biogas-powered fuel cell and built rooftop solar photovoltaic systems. They introduced their redesigned AirPort Express with an enclosure containing bio-based polymers derived from industrial-grade rapeseed and post-consumer recycled PC-ABS plastic.&lt;ref name="AppleWebsite" /&gt;

===Greenpeace's criticism of Apple===
{{see also|Criticism of Greenpeace#Greener Electronics campaign}}
[[Greenpeace]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenpeace International|title=Greenpeace International|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; has criticized Apple for having products that are seen as unfriendly to the environment. In 2007, Greenpeace wrote an article explaining the hazardous materials that have been found in the iPhone, such as vinyl ([[PVC]]) plastic with [[phthalates]], along with brominated compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenpeace|title=Hazardous Materials Found in Apple's iPhone: Chemicals Include those Banned in Children's Toys in EU|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/media-center/news-releases/hazardous-materials-found-in-a/|publisher=Greenpeace|work=Greenpeace International|accessdate=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only that, but Greenpeace also mentions in a different article from 2004 that Apple had refused to take the step of phasing out toxic chemicals in all of their products. They argued that [[Sony]] was removing toxins from their TVs, and that [[Samsung]], [[Nokia]], and [[Puma SE|Puma]] had also announced to phase out toxic chemicals in all of their products, yet Apple was not playing their part in the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenpeace|title=Toxins in your TV, poisons in your PC?|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/toxins-in-your-tv-poisons-in/|publisher=Greenpeace|work=Greenpeace International|accessdate=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Greenpeace's concern, they published a ranking guide in 2006 to improve policies and practices regarding the process of "going green." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenpeace|title=Green my Apple bears fruit|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/greening-of-apple-310507/|work=Greenpeace International|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenpeace reached out to Apple's fans and consumers in attempt to gain the attention of Steve Jobs in September 2006. In order to do this, they launched a "Green my Apple" website that was designed to look like Apple's site. The caption on the site was, "I love my Mac. I just wish it came in green." They called this the "Green my Apple" campaign. Ultimately, their campaign was successful. Steve Jobs spoke of the company's desire to become greener in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Appleinsider Staff|title=Steve Jobs unveils Apple's environmental policy|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/07/05/02/steve_jobs_unveils_changes_to_apples_environmental_policy|work=Appleinsider.com|publisher=Appleinsider.com|accessdate=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much later, in November 2012, Greenpeace created a ranking of companies in their progression toward greener products and waste management &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenpeace|title=2012 Guide to Greener Electronics|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Campaign-analysis/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/|work=Greenpeace|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple moved up to number six (out of sixteen), just behind [[Dell]]. Number one was [[WIPRO]], and number sixteen was [[BlackBerry|RIM]]. Apple scored a six due to the company's lack of transparency on [[GHG emission]] reporting, [[clean energy]] advocacy, further information on its management of toxic chemicals, and details on post-consumer [[recycled plastic]] use.&lt;ref name="Greenpeace"&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenpeace|title=Apple: 6th position, 4.5/10|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/climate/2012/GuideGreenerElectronics/APPLE.pdf|work=Greenpeace|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that Apple lost points on Greenpeace's [[e-waste]] criteria, Apple exceeded its 70% goal of global recycling in 2010. Greenpeace argues that the company can increase its score by setting an ambitious goal for boosting its [[renewable energy]] use by 2020. Apple also did not plan to phase out [[antimony]] or [[beryllium]] in their products, but overall, score well on the product criteria. For example, the Macbook Pro has been known for easy recycling.

Apple has been making progress since 2006 regarding greener tactics and products. Presently in 2013, Apple states that they achieve to power every Apple facility with energy from renewable sources. They have already achieved this goal at facilities in Austin, Cork, Munich, and at the [[Infinite Loop (street)|Infinite Loop]] campus in Cupertino. Currently, Apple's corporate facilities worldwide are at 75% renewable energy.&lt;ref name="Greenpeace"/&gt;

== Removal of HKmap.live from App Store  ==
{{See also|HKmap.live#iOS app}}
On October 9, 2019, Apple removed an application named "[[HKmap.live]]" from the App Store based on claims made by the [[Hong Kong Police Force]] that the app was being used by protesters to aid in violent attacks on police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/10/02/apple_hong_kong/|title=Here's that hippie, pro-privacy, pro-freedom Apple y'all so love: Hong Kong protest safety app banned from iOS store|last=at 21:47|first=Kieren McCarthy in San Francisco 2 Oct 2019|website=www.theregister.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, Apple labelled Crimea as part of Russia in [[Apple Maps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/28/apple-under-fire-for-labelling-crimea-as-part-of-russia-in-its-apps|title=Apple under fire for labelling Crimea as part of Russia in its apps|last=|first=|date=28 November 2019|website=The Guardian|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=24 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applied only to Apple users in Russia and Ukraine. Users in other countries showed Crimea as belonging to Ukraine. In Ukraine, the change has been viewed as Apple's acceptance of Russia’s annexation of the territory after Russia-backed forces took over the Crimea in 2014.

The company's move was criticised by the Ukrainian government.

Apple has often been accused of [[planned obsolescence]] – the idea that it deliberately manufactures its devices so that they seem obsolete before this is the case, typically with the intent of selling a 'new and improved' version.&lt;ref name="stiles"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stiles|first1=Jackson|title=This is how long your Apple iPhone will last|url=http://thenewdaily.com.au/life/tech/2016/04/18/iphone-life-expectancy/|publisher=[[The New Daily]]|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tsukayama|first1=Hayley|title=The problem with Apple's war on this age-old design|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/08/08/the-problem-with-apples-war-on-this-age-old-design/|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cracking the Apple Trap|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/magazine/why-apple-wants-to-bust-your-iphone.html|publisher=The New York Times Magazine|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planned Obsolescence, as Myth or Reality|url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/planned-obsolescence-as-myth-or-reality/|work=The New York Times|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Brad|title=PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE HAS LED TO RIDICULOUS PRODUCT CYCLES, AND IT'S TIME TO SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/apple-iphone-7-planned-obsolescence/|publisher=Digital Trends|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A class action lawsuit alleging planned obsolescence in the iOS 9 update was filed in New York state in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IOS 9 Slows iPhone 4S Complaint|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/294247024/IOS-9-Slows-iPhone-4S-Complaint|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pelegrin|first1=Williams|title=Furious iPhone 4S owners sue Apple for $5M, alleging iOS 9 crippled their phones|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/iphone-4s-planned-obsolescence-lawsuit/|publisher=Digital Trends|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--another lawsuit is said to have been made in 2011 and another one in Brazil: http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/02/21/brazilian-lawsuit-accuses-apple-of-planned-obsolescence-with-fourth-gen-ipad --&gt; An [[online petition]] created by consumer group [[SumOfUs]] in July 2016 accused Apple of "sabotaging" devices with software upgrades designed to slow down older models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bogart|first1=Nicole|title=Is Apple guilty of using 'planned obsolescence' to force iPhone users into upgrading?|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2926170/is-apple-guilty-of-using-planned-obsolescence-to-force-iphone-users-into-upgrading/|publisher=Global News|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SomOfUs Petition: Apple: Don't push iOS "upgrades" which sabotage older iPhones and iPads|url=https://actions.sumofus.org/a/planned-obsolescence-is-why-apple-isn-t-a-green-company/|publisher=[[SumOfUs]]|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another SumOfUs petition that reached over 300,000 signees in September 2016 also accuses Apple of planned obsolescence by removing the standard [[headphone jack]] in the [[iPhone 7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abbany|first1=Zulfikar|title=iPhone 7 petition: Apple 'screwing customers and planet' with headphone jack|url=http://www.dw.com/en/iphone-7-petition-apple-screwing-customers-and-planet-with-headphone-jack/a-18980996|accessdate=8 September 2016|publisher=Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple is ditching the standard headphone jack to screw consumers and the planet|url=https://actions.sumofus.org/a/iphone-headphone-jack|publisher=[[SumOfUs]]|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{secondary source needed|date=September 2019}}

Upon its release, Apple stated that the [[iOS 10]].2.1 update contained fixes to address unexpected shutdowns reported by some users, particularly on [[iPhone 6]] and [[IPhone 6S|6S]] models when they had 30% battery life remaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-6-6s-sudden-shutdown-weve-almost-fully-cured-issue-with-ios-10-2-1-says-apple/|title=iPhone 6, 6s sudden shutdown? We've almost fully cured issue with iOS 10.2.1, says Apple|last=Tung|first=Liam|website=ZDNet|language=en|access-date=2019-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, Apple admitted that these changes included new power management routines that [[Dynamic frequency scaling|throttle]] the CPUs on older iPhone models (beginning with the [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone SE]] and iPhone 6 series, and extended to the [[iPhone 7]] series on [[iOS 11]]) in order to preserve system stability. Apple explained that the devices' batteries "become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic component", and stated that these measures were part of efforts to "deliver the best experience for customers, which includes overall performance and prolonging the life of their devices".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-slowing-down-older-iphones-to-prevent-battery-issues/|title=Apple: Some older iPhones slowed to prevent battery issues|last=Smith|first=Jake|website=ZDNet|language=en|access-date=2019-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple subsequently announced that through most of 2018, it would offer battery replacements at a discounted price ([[United States dollar|US$]]29, $50 cheaper than the normal cost for an out-of-warranty battery replacement) for existing iPhone models. The iOS 11.3 update would add a "Battery health" area to the system settings menu, allowing users to view the effective capacity of their device's battery, whether "performance management" had been enabled in order to preserve battery health and stability, and suggests when a battery replacement should be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/28/16827248/apple-iphone-battery-replacement-price-slow-down-apology|title=Apple apologizes for iPhone slowdown drama, will offer $29 battery replacements for a year|last=Patel|first=Nilay|date=December 27, 2019|website=The Verge|access-date=September 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article/358246/how-to-tell-if-you-need-a-new-iphone-battery|title=How to Tell if You Need a New iPhone Battery|last=Griffith|first=Eric|website=PCMAG|language=en|access-date=2019-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2019, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated in a shareholder letter that over 11 million battery replacements had been made under the discount program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-iphone-revenue-shortfall-2019|title=Apple's iPhone sales shortfall could cost it $9 billion in revenue|last=Swider|first=Matt |website=TechRadar|language=en|access-date=2019-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{reflist|group=Note|refs=
&lt;ref name=Note01&gt;Apple has not released more recent estimates&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Note02&gt;Global Taxes Paid by ASI, 2009–2011&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Note03&gt;"A.O.I.'s board minutes show that its board of directors consists of two Apple Inc. employees who live in California and one Irish employee of Apple Distribution International, an Irish company that A.O.I. itself owns," Levin said on Tuesday. "Over the last six years, from May, 2006, through the end of 2012, A.O.I. held thirty-three board meetings, thirty-two of which took place in Cupertino, California. A.O.I.'s lone Irish-resident director participated in just seven of those meetings, six by telephone, and in none of the eighteen board meetings between September, 2006, and August, 2012."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Note04&gt;In annual reports between 2009 and 2011, the company told investors it was setting aside $13.7 billion to pay federal taxes—but it has actually paid only $5.3 billion. Those set-asides are only advance estimates, but it's pretty strange that each year they're off by many billions of dollars. As a result, Apple's actual US tax rate is only 20.1%, much lower than the 24% to 32% it said it was paying.&lt;/ref&gt;
