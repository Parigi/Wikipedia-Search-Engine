'''Juno''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|dʒ|uː|n|oʊ}} {{respell|JOO|noh}}; {{lang-la|IVNO}}, {{lang|la|Iūnō}} {{IPA-la|ˈjuːnoː|}}) is an [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman goddess]], the protector and special counselor of the state. A daughter of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], she is the wife of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and the mother of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]] and [[Juventas]]. She is the Roman equivalent of [[Hera]], queen of the gods in [[Greek mythology]]; like Hera, her sacred animal was the [[peacock]].&lt;ref name=Lar&gt;''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', [[The Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[Etruscan Civilization|Etruscan]] counterpart was [[Uni (mythology)|Uni]], and she was said to also watch over the women of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Corbishley, Mike ''Ancient Rome'' Warwick Press 1986 p.62&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[patron goddess]] of [[Rome]] and the [[Roman Empire]], Juno was called {{lang|la|Regina}} ("Queen") and was a member of the [[Capitoline Triad]] (''Juno Capitolina''), centered on the [[Capitoline Hill]] in Rome; it consisted of her, Jupiter, and [[Minerva]], goddess of wisdom.

Juno's own warlike aspect among the Romans is apparent in her attire. She is often shown armed and wearing a goatskin cloak. The traditional depiction of this warlike aspect was assimilated from the Greek goddess [[Athena]], who bore a goatskin, or a goatskin shield, called the '[[aegis]]'.

==Etymology==
The name ''Juno'' was also once thought to be connected to ''Iove'' (Jove), originally as ''Diuno'' and ''Diove'' from ''*Diovona''.&lt;ref&gt;P. K. Buttmann ''Mythologus'' I Berlin 1828 p. 200 ff.; J. A. Hartung ''Die Religion der Römer'' II Erlangen 1836 p. 62 ; L. Preller ''Rômische Mythologie'' I.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 20th century, a derivation was proposed from ''iuven-'' (as in Latin ''iuvenis'', "youth"), through a syncopated form ''iūn-'' (as in ''iūnix'', "heifer", and ''iūnior'', "younger"). This etymology became widely accepted after it was endorsed by [[Georg Wissowa]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Wissowa ''Religion und Kultus der Römer'' Munich 1912 pp. 181-2, drawing on W. Schulze and W. Otto in 1904 and 1905. Juno would then be a derivate noun in ''-ōn-'', rather unusual in the feminine.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Iuuen-'' is related to Latin ''aevum'' and Greek ''[[Aeon|aion]]'' (αἰών) through a common [[Proto-Indo-European root|Indo-European root]] referring to a concept of vital energy or "fertile time".&lt;ref&gt;[[Émile Benveniste]], "Expression indo-européenne de l' éternité" ''Bulletin de la société de linguistique de Paris'' '''38''', 1937, pp.103-112: the theme *yuwen- includes the root *yu- at degree 0 and the suffix -wen-. The original meaning of the root *yu- is that of vital force as found in Vedic ''ắyuh'' vital force, ''āyúh'' genius of the vital force and also in Greek αιών and Latin ''aevum''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''iuvenis'' is he who has the fullness of vital force.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert E. A. Palmer]] ''Roman Religion and Roman Empire. Five Essays'' Philadelphia, 1974, p. 4; Marcel Renard "Le nom de Junon" in ''Phoibos'' '''5''' 1950, 1, p. 141-143.&lt;/ref&gt; In some inscriptions Jupiter himself is called ''Iuuntus'', and one of the epithets of Jupiter is ''Ioviste'', a [[superlative|superlative form]] of ''iuuen-'' meaning "the youngest".&lt;ref&gt;G. Wissowa above p. 135; G. Dumézil ''La relig. rom. arch.'' Paris 1974; It. tr. Milano 1977 p. 185-186; C. W. Atkins "Latin 'Iouiste' et le vocabulaire religieux indoeuropéen" in ''Mélanges Benveniste'' Paris, 1975, pp.527-535&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iuventas]], "Youth", was one of two deities who "refused" to leave the [[Capitoline|Capitol]] when the building of the new [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Temple of Capitoline Jove]] required the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#exauguratio|exauguration]] of deities who already occupied the site.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Antiquitates Romanae,'' III 69, 5-6. M Renard remarks that the annual procession which took the image of the goddess (represented as a goose) from the temple of Juno Moneta on the Arx to the Capitoline temple in a ''lectica'' portantine, stopped and placed the image between the ''cella'' of Jupiter and that of Minerva and there, in the ''pronaos'' in front of the statue of Minerva, stood Iuventas's aedicula. "Aspects anciens de Janus et de Junon" in ''Revue belge de philologie'' 1953 p. 21; V. Basanoff ''Les dieux des romains'' 1942 p. 154; Livy V 54, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Juno is the equivalent to Hera, the Greek goddess for love and marriage. Juno is the Roman goddess of love and marriage.   
Ancient etymologies associated Juno's name with ''iuvare'', "to aid, benefit", and ''iuvenescere'', "rejuvenate", sometimes connecting it to the renewal of the new and waxing moon, perhaps implying the idea of a moon goddess.&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''Ling. Lat.'' V 67 and 69 ; Cicero, ''Nat. Deor.'' II 66; Plutarch, ''Quaestiones Romanae,'' 77.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- It might be noteworthy that Roman Juno is not only equivalent with Etruscan Uni, but both names are also etymologically related.--&gt;

==Roles and epithets==

[[Nephele]] sits at Mercury's feet; a Roman fresco from the eastern wall of the [[triclinium]] in the [[House of the Vettii]], [[Pompeii]], [[Pompeian Styles|Fourth Style]] (60-79 AD).]]
Juno's theology is one of the most complex and disputed issues in Roman religion. Even more than other major Roman deities, Juno held a large number of significant and diverse [[epithet]]s, names and titles representing various aspects and roles of the goddess. In accordance with her central role as a goddess of marriage, these included ''Pronuba'' and ''Cinxia'' ("she who looses the bride's girdle"). However, other epithets of Juno have wider implications and are less thematically linked.

While her connection with the idea of vital force, fullness of vital energy, eternal youthfulness is now generally acknowledged, the multiplicity and complexity of her personality have given rise to various and sometimes irreconcilable interpretations among modern scholars.

Juno is certainly the divine protectress of the community, who shows both a sovereign and a fertility character, often associated with a military one. She was present in many towns of ancient Italy: at [[Lanuvium]] as Sespeis Mater Regina, [[Laurentum]], [[Tibur]], [[Falerii]], [[Veii]] as Regina, at Tibur and Falerii as Regina and Curitis, [[Tusculum]] and [[Norba]] as Lucina. She is also attested at [[Praeneste]], [[Aricia, Italy|Aricia]], [[Ardea, Lazio|Ardea]], [[Gabii]]. In five Latin towns a month was named after Juno (Aricia, Lanuvium, Laurentum, Praeneste, Tibur).&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' VI 59-62&lt;/ref&gt; Outside Latium in [[Campania]] at [[Teanum Apulum|Teanum]] she was Populona (she who increase the number of the people or, in K. Latte's understanding of the ''iuvenes'', the army), in [[Umbria]] at [[Pisaurum]] Lucina, at Terventum in [[Samnium]] Regina, at Pisarum Regina Matrona, at [[Aesernia]] in Samnium Regina Populona. In Rome she was since the most ancient times named Lucina, Mater and Regina. It is debated whether she was also known as Curitis before the [[evocatio]] of the Juno of Falerii: this though seems probable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Gagé]] "Les autels de Titus Tatius. Une variante sabine des rites d' integration dans les curies?" in ''Melanges J. Heurgon. L'Italie préromaine et la Rome républicaine.'' I '' Colléction de l 'École Français de Rome'' '''27''' 1976 p. 316 ; Dionysius of Halicarnassus ''Roman Anitquities'' II 50, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other epithets of hers that were in use at Rome include [[Moneta]] and Caprotina, Tutula, Fluonia or Fluviona, Februalis, the last ones associated with the rites of purification and fertility of February.&lt;ref&gt;G. Radke ''Die Götter Altitaliens'' Münster 1965 articles Tutela, Tutula and Fluonia, Fluviona.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her various epithets thus show a complex of mutually interrelated functions that in the view of [[Georges Dumézil]] and [[Vsevolod Basanoff]] (author of ''Les dieux Romains'') can be traced back to the Indoeuropean trifunctional ideology: as Regina and Moneta she is a sovereign deity, as Sespeis, Curitis (spear holder) and Moneta (again) she is an armed protectress, as Mater and Curitis (again) she is a goddess of the fertility and wealth of the community in her association with the [[curiae]].

The epithet ''Lucina''&lt;ref&gt;The ancient were divided on the etymology of Lucina: some connected the epithet with the word ''lucus'' since the goddess had since the most ancient times a sacred grove and a temple on the Cispius near that of [[Mefitis]]: Pliny XVI 235; Varro ''Lin. Lat.'' V 49; Ovid ''Fasti'' II 435 and VI 449. Other favoured the derivation from ''lux'' as goddess of infants: Varro ''Lingua latina'' V 69; Cicero, ''Nat. Deor.'' II 68; Ovid ''Fasti,'' ii 450 and III 255; Plutarch, ''Quaestiones Romanae,'' 77. The association of Juno Lucina and Mefitis on the same or closely nearby site may not be coincidental as at Rossano di Vaglio in [[Lucania]] have been discovered inscriptions linking the two entities: "μ]εfίτηι καπροτινν[ιαις" and "διωvιιας διομανας" (domina) : cf. M. Lejeune "Notes de linguistique italique XXIII: Le culte de Rossano di Vaglio" in ''Revue d'Etudes Latins'' '''45''' 1967 p. 202-221; "Inscriptions de Rossano di Vaglio 1971" in ''RAL'' '''26''' 1971 p. 667 ff. The inscriptions are dated to the 3rd-2nd centuries.&lt;/ref&gt; is particularly revealing since it reflects two interrelated aspects of the function of Juno: cyclical renewal of time in the waning and waxing of the moon and protection of delivery and birth (as she who brings to light the newborn as vigour, vital force). The ancient called her ''Covella'' in her function of helper in the ''labours'' of the new moon. The view that she was also a Moon goddess though is no longer accepted by scholars, as such a role belongs to [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] ''Lucifera'': through her association with the moon she governed the feminine physiological functions, menstrual cycle and pregnancy: as a rule all lunar deities are deities of childbirth. These aspects of Juno mark the heavenly and worldly sides of her function. She is thus associated to all beginnings and hers are the [[kalendae]] of every month: at Laurentum she was known as ''Kalendaris Iuno'' (Juno of the [[Kalends]]).&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Sat. '' I 15, 18; Varro ''Ling. Lat.'' V 69&lt;/ref&gt; At Rome on the Kalends of every month the ''[[pontifex minor]]'' invoked her, under the epithet ''Covella'', when from the ''[[curia Calabra]]'' he announced the date of the ''nonae''.&lt;ref&gt;Varro VI 27: "sic :"Die te quinti kalo Iuno Covella" or "Septimi die te kalo Iuno Covella"; but the text looks to be corrupt: R. Schilling restitutes: "...&amp;nbsp;dixit quinquies: "Kalo Iuno Covella" aut (or) septies: "Kalo Iuno C." ".&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day the ''[[regina sacrorum]]'' sacrificed to Juno a white sow or lamb in the [[Regia]]. She is closely associated with [[Janus]], the god of passages and beginnings who after her is often named ''Iunonius''.

Some scholars view this concentration of multiple functions as a typical and structural feature of the goddess, inherent to her being an expression of the nature of femininity.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ARR; V. Basanoff ''Les diuex des Romains''&lt;/ref&gt; Others though prefer to dismiss her aspects of femininity and fertility&lt;ref&gt;R. E. A. Palmer above, p. 3-56.&lt;/ref&gt; and stress only her quality of being the spirit of youthfulness, liveliness and strength, regardless of sexual connexions, which would then change according to circumstances: thus in men she incarnates the ''iuvenes'', a word often used to designate soldiers, hence resulting in a tutelary deity of the sovereignty of peoples; in women capable of bearing children, from puberty on she oversees childbirth and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;R. E. A. Palmer above, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Thence she would be a ''poliad'' goddess related to politics, power and war. Others think her military and poliadic qualities arise from her being a fertility goddess who through her function of increasing the numbers of the community became also associated to political and military functions.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Latte ''Römishe Religionsgeshichte'' Munich 1960 p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juno Sospita and Lucina===
[[File:Fresco from the Golden House of Nero, found in Rome in 1668, Ashmolean Museum (8401788678).jpg|thumbnail|A woman, perhaps Juno Lucina, goddess of childbirth, presents the goddess of love, Aphrodite (Roman Venus) with the beautiful infant Adonis.]]
''Part of the following sections is based on the article by Geneviève Dury Moyaers and Marcel Renard "Aperçu critique des travaux relatifs au culte de Junon" in ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der Römische Welt'' 1981 p. 142-202.''

The rites of the month of February and the ''Nonae Caprotinae'' of July 5 offer a depiction of Juno's roles in the spheres of fertility, war, and regality.

In the Roman calendar, February is a month of universal purification, and begins the new year. In book II of his ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', Ovid derives the month's name from ''februae'' (expiations);&lt;ref&gt;Ovid  ''Fasti II'' 19-46: see also Servius ''Aeneid'' VIII 343; Varro ''Lingua Latina'' VI 13; Paulus ex Festo s.v. p. 75 L&lt;/ref&gt; lustrations designed to remove spiritual contamination or ritual pollution accumulated in the previous year. On the 1st of the month, a black ox was sacrificed to [[Helernus]], a minor underworld deity whom Dumézil takes as a [[vegetation deity|god of vegetation]] related to the cult of [[Cardea|Carna]]/Crane, a nymph who may be an image of Juno Sospita.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Dumézil ''Fêtes romaines d'eté et d'automne. Suivi par dix questions romaines'' Paris 1975 "Question dix. Theologica minora". Helernus is also associated with the black beans used as offerings to the restless dead on March 1, during [[Lemuralia]].&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, Juno's ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|dies natalis]]'' ("birthday") as Juno Sospita was celebrated at her [[Palatine]] temple. On February 15 the [[Lupercalia]] festival was held, in which Juno was involved as ''Juno Lucina''. This is usually understood to be a rite of purification and fertility.&lt;ref&gt;In Ovid's ''Fasti'' II 425-452, the rite is named after the ''lucus'' of Juno Lucina on the [[Esquiline]], though according to Varro it was located on the [[Cispius]]&lt;/ref&gt; A goat was sacrificed and its hide cut into strips, used to make whips known as ''februum'' and ''amiculus Iunonis'', wielded by the [[Lupercalia|Luperci]].&lt;ref&gt;Paulus ex Festo above p. 75 L; Mythographi Romani III 3; Martianus Capella ''De Nuptiis Mercurii et Philolologiae'' II 149: "Iuno Februalis".&lt;/ref&gt; The Juno of this day bears the epithet of ''Februalis'', ''Februata'', ''Februa''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. G. Radke above article Februa, Februata for the different forms of the epithet.&lt;/ref&gt; On the last day of the month, leading into March 1, she was celebrated as protectress of matrons and marriages. The new year began on March 1. The same was celebrated as the birthday of Rome's founder and first king, [[Romulus]], and the peaceful union of Romans and Sabine peoples through treaty and marriage after their [[The Rape of the Sabine Women|war]], which was ended by the intervention of women.

After Wissowa&lt;ref&gt;G. Wissowa above p.185&lt;/ref&gt; many scholars have remarked the similarity between the Juno of the Lupercalia and the Juno of Lanuvium ''Seispes Mater Regina'' as both are associated with the goat, symbol of fertility. But in essence there is unity between fertility, regality and purification.&lt;ref&gt;Y._M. Duval "Les Lupercales, Junon et le printemps." ''Annales be Bretagne et des Pays de l'Ouest'' '''83''' 1976 p. 271-2.&lt;/ref&gt; This unity is underlined by the role of [[Faunus]] in the aetiologic story told by Ovid and the symbolic relevance of the [[Lupercal]]:{{clarify|date=October 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' II 362-453.&lt;/ref&gt; asked by the Roman couples at her ''lucus'' how to overcome the sterility that ensued the abduction of the Sabine women, Juno answered through a murmuring of leaves "''Italidas matres sacer hircus inito''" "That a sacred ram cover the Italic mothers".&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' II 441.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Februlis'' oversees the secundament of the placenta&lt;ref&gt;Mythographi Romani III 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and is strictly associated to ''Fluvonia, Fluonia'', goddess who retains the blood inside the body during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Paulus s. v. p. 82 L.&lt;/ref&gt; While the protection of pregnancy is stressed by Duval, Palmer sees in Fluonia only the Juno of lustration in river water.&lt;ref&gt;Mythographi Romani III 3; Paulus ex Festo s.v. p. 82 L; Martianus Capella above II 149; Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' III 30; R. E. A. Palmer above, p.&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid devotes an ''excursus'' to the lustrative function of river water in the same place in which he explains the etymology of February.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' II 35-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

A temple (''aedes'') of Juno Lucina was built in 375 BC&lt;ref&gt;Pliny ''Naturalis Historia'' XVI 235.&lt;/ref&gt; in the grove sacred to the goddess from early times.&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''Lingua Latina'' V 49, 74 dedication by Titus Tatius; Dionysius Halicarnasseus IV 15.&lt;/ref&gt; It stood precisely on the [[Cispius]] near the sixth shrine of the [[Argei]].&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''Lingua Latina'' V 50; Ovid ''Fasti'' II 435-6; III 245-6.&lt;/ref&gt; probably not far west of the church of S. Prassede, where inscriptions relating to her cult have been found.&lt;ref&gt;[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]] VI 356-361; 3694-5; 30199.&lt;/ref&gt; The grove should have extended down the slope south of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;In 41 BC Q. Pedius quaestor built or restored a wall which seems to have surrounded both: cf. CIL VI 358.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Servius Tullius]] ordered the gifts for the newborn to be placed in the treasury of the temple though it looks that another shrine stood there before 375 BC. In 190 BC the temple was struck by lightning, its gable and doors injured.&lt;ref&gt;Livy XXXXVII 3, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The annual festival of the [[Matronalia]] was celebrated here on March 1, day of the dedication of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' III 247; Festus p. 147 M; Hemer. Praenest. ad Kal. Mart.; CIL I 2nd p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Ball Platner &amp; T. Ashby ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' London 1929 p. 288-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

A temple to Iuno Sospita was vowed by consul [[Gaius Cornelius Cethegus]] in 197 BC and dedicated in 194. By 90 BC the temple had fallen into disrepute: in that year it was stained by episodes of prostitution and a bitch delivered her puppies right beneath the statue of the goddess.&lt;ref&gt;Iulius Obsequens 55.&lt;/ref&gt; By decree of the senate consul [[Lucius Julius Caesar (consul 90 BC)|L. Iulius Caesar]] ordered its restoration.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''De Divinatione'' I 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In his poem ''Fasti'' Ovid states the temple of Juno Sospita had become dilapidated to the extent of being no longer discernible "because of the injuries of time":&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' II 57-58&lt;/ref&gt; this looks hardly possible as the restoration had happened no longer than a century earlier and relics of the temple exist to-day.&lt;ref&gt;S. Ball Platner&amp; T. Ashby ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' London 1929 p.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thence plausible that an older temple of Juno Sospita existed in Rome within the [[pomerium]], as Ovid says it was located near the temple of the Phrygian Mother ([[Cybele]]), which stood on the western corner of the [[Palatine]]. As a rule temples of foreign, imported gods stood outside the pomerium.

===Juno Caprotina===
The alliance of the three aspects of Juno finds a strictly related parallel to the Lupercalia in the festival of the ''Nonae Caprotinae''. On that day the Roman free and slave women picnicked and had fun together near the site of the wild fig (''caprificus''): the custom implied runs, mock battles with fists and stones, obscene language and finally the sacrifice of a male goat to Juno ''Caprotina'' under a wildfig tree and with the using of its lymph.

This festival had a legendary aetiology in a particularly delicate episode of Roman history and also recurs at (or shortly after) a particular time of the year, that of the so-called ''caprificatio'' when branches of wild fig trees were fastened to cultivated ones to promote insemination. The historical episode narrated by ancient sources concerns the siege of Rome by the Latin peoples that followed the Gallic sack. The dictator of the Latins Livius Postumius from [[Fidenae]] would have requested the Roman senate that the ''matronae'' and daughters of the most prominent families be surrendered to the Latins as hostages. While the senate was debating the issue a slave girl, whose Greek name was [[Philotis (mythology)|Philotis]] and Latin Tutela or Tutula proposed that she together with other slave girls would render herself up to the enemy camp pretending to be the wives and daughters of the Roman families. Upon agreement of the senate, the women dressed up elegantly and wearing golden jewellery reached the Latin camp. There they seduced the Latins into fooling and drinking: after they had fallen asleep they stole their swords. Then Tutela gave the convened signal to the Romans brandishing an ignited branch after climbing on the wild fig (''caprificus'') and hiding the fire with her mantle. The Romans then irrupted into the Latin camp killing the enemies in their sleep. The women were rewarded with freedom and a dowry at public expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch ''Camillus'' 33; ''Romulus'' 29; Varro ''Lin. Lat.'' VI 18; Macrobius ''Sat.'' I 11, 35-40&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumézil in his ''Archaic Roman Religion'' had been unable to interpret the myth underlying this legendary event, later though he accepted the interpretation given by P. Drossart and published it in his ''Fêtes romaines d'été et d'automne, suivi par dix questions romaines'' in 1975 as ''Question IX''.&lt;ref&gt;P. Drossart "Nonae caprotinae: la fausse capture des Aurores" in ''Revue de l'Histoire des Religions'' 185 '''2''' 1974 p. 129-139&lt;/ref&gt; In folklore the wild fig tree is universally associated with sex because of its fertilising power, the shape of its fruits and the white viscous juice of the tree.

Basanoff has argued that the legend not only alludes to sex and fertility in its association with wildfig and goat but is in fact a summary of sort of all the qualities of Juno. As Juno Sespeis of Lanuvium Juno Caprotina is a warrior, a fertiliser and a sovereign protectress. In fact the legend presents a heroine, Tutela, who is a slightly disguised representation of the goddess: the request of the Latin dictator would mask an attempted [[evocatio]] of the tutelary goddess of Rome. [[Tutela]] indeed shows regal, military and protective traits, apart from the sexual ones. Moreover, according to Basanoff these too (breasts, milky juice, ''genitalia'', present or symbolised in the fig and the goat) in general, and here in particular, have an inherently apotropaic value directly related to the nature of Juno. The occasion of the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#feria|''feria'']], shortly after the [[poplifugia]], i.e. when the community is in its direst straits, needs the intervention of a divine tutelary goddess, a divine queen, since the king (divine or human) has failed to appear or has fled. Hence the customary battles under the wild figs, the scurrilous language that bring together the second and third function. This festival would thus show a ritual that can prove the trifunctional nature of Juno.&lt;ref&gt;Vsevolod Basanoff "Nonae Caprotinae" in ''Latomus'' '''8''' 1949 p. 209-216&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars&lt;ref&gt;E. Gjerstad ''Early Rome. V'' Lund 1973 p. 28ff.; D. Porte ''caper'' and ''caprificus'' = phallus p. 183ff.; G. Radke ''Die Götter Altitaliens'' Münster 1965 article Caprotina und Tutula: Caprotina would derive from a word meaninig ''phallus'' and corresponding to the obscene character of the festival; M. Lejeune; J. Loicq in his review of Dumézil's book ''Fêtes Romaines'' (in ''Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire'' '''55''' 1977 p. 524-7) too expresses the view that Tutŭla, Tutĕla cannot be connected linguistically to the word and notion of ''tutēla'' because of the different quantity of the ''e'', but should have a sexual meaning as also is true in the case of goddess Tutilina.&lt;/ref&gt; limit their interpretation of Caprotina to the sexual implications of the goat, the ''caprificus'' and the obscene words and plays of the festival.

===Juno Curitis===
Under this epithet Juno is attested in many places, notably at [[Falerii]]&lt;ref&gt;CIL XI 3100;3125;3126.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tibur]].&lt;ref&gt;Servius ''Aen.'' I 8 : the goddess uses cart and spear; I 17: "in the ceremonies of Tibur the following prayer is uttered: "''Juno Curitis'', (I beseech Thee) with your cart (curru) and your shield (clipeo) do protect my young slaves of ''curia'' born into my house". The precise meaning of ''curia'' at Tibur is unclear.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil remarked that Juno Curitis "is represented and invoked at Rome under conditions very close to those we know about for ''Juno Seispes'' of [[Lanuvium]]".&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil "Iuno SMR"  ''Eranos'' '''52''' 1954 p. 117 n.&lt;/ref&gt; Martianus Capella states she must be invoked by those who are involved in war.&lt;ref&gt;Martianus Capella ''De Nupt. Merc. et Philol.'' II 149: "Curitim debent memorare bellantes".&lt;/ref&gt; The hunt of the goat by stonethrowing at Falerii is described in Ovid ''Amores'' III 13, 16 ff. In fact the Juno Curritis of Falerii shows a complex articulated structure closely allied to the threefold Juno Seispes of Lanuvium.&lt;ref&gt;A description of Juno Sespeis's attire is given in Cicero ''De Natura Deorum'' I 82: "cum pelle caprina, cum hasta, cum calceolis repandis": "with a goat skin, a spear and pointed boots curving backwards".&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient etymologies associated the epithet with [[Cures, Sabinum|Cures]],&lt;ref&gt;Schol. Pers. ''Sat.'' IV 26; Stephanus Byzant. s.v. Κυρίς; Festus p. 302 L&lt;/ref&gt; with the Sabine word for spear ''curis'',&lt;ref&gt;Paulus ex Festo p. 43 and 55 L; Servius ''Aen.'' I 8; Plutarch ''Romulus'' 29; ''Quaestiones Romanae,'' 87; Ovid ''Fasti'' II 477&lt;/ref&gt; with ''currus'' cart,&lt;ref&gt;Servius ''Aen. '' I8&lt;/ref&gt; with ''Quirites'',&lt;ref&gt;Cf. G. Radke above, article Cur(r)itis&lt;/ref&gt; with the ''curiae'', as king Titus Tatius dedicated a table to Juno in every curia, that Dionysius still saw.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus, ''Antiquitates Romanae'', II 50, 3; Servius ''Aen.''I 17; Paul. ex Fest. s.v. Curiales menses p.56 L.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholars have proposed the town of Currium or Curria, [[Quirinus]], ''*quir(i)s'' or ''*quiru'', the Sabine word for spear and [[curia]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Bickel "Beiträge zur Römische Religionsgeshichte. I Flamen curialis und Iuno Curitis" ''Reinische Museum zur Philologie'' '''71''' 1916 p. 560; G. Radke above, article Cur(r)itis; P. Kretschmer "Iuno Curitis" ''Glotta'' '''10''' 1920 p. 147-157; J. Gagé "Les autel de Titus Tatius. Une variante sabine des rites d' integration dans les curies?" in ''Melanges J. Heurgon'' I ''Coll. Ec. Fr. Rome'' '''27''' 1976 p. 516&lt;/ref&gt; The *quiru- would design the sacred spear that gave the name to the primitive curiae. The discovery at [[Sulmona]] of a sanctuary of [[Hercules]] ''Curinus'' lends support to a Sabine origin of the epithet and of the cult of Juno in the curiae.&lt;ref&gt;E. Paratore-R. Verdière "Varron avait raison" ''L'Antiquite Classique'' '''62''' I 1973 p. 49-63; J. Poucet ''Recherces sur la legende sabine des origines de Rome'' p.322&lt;/ref&gt; The spear could also be the ''celibataris hasta'' (bridal spear) that in the marriage ceremonies was used to comb the bridegroom's hair as a good omen.&lt;ref&gt;R. Schilling "Ianus dieu intrducteur, dieu des passages" above; D. P. Harmon "Religion in Latin Elegists" in ''ANRW'' 1986 p. 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer views the rituals of the curiae devoted to her as a reminiscence of the origin of the curiae themselves in rites of ''evocatio'', a practice the Romans continued to use for Juno or her equivalent at later times as for Falerii, [[Veii]] and [[Carthage]].&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Sat.'' III 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Juno Curitis would then be the deity evoked after her admission into the curiae.

Juno Curitis had a temple on the [[Campus Martius]]. Excavations in Largo di Torre Argentina have revealed four temple structures, one of whom (temple D or A) could be the temple of Juno Curitis. She shared her anniversary day with Juppiter Fulgur, who had an altar nearby.&lt;ref&gt;A. Claridge, J. Toms, T. Cubberley ''Rome'' 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juno Moneta===
This Juno is placed by ancient sources in a warring context. Dumézil thinks the third, military, aspect of Juno is reflected in Juno Curitis and Moneta.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ''Iuno Sospita Mater Regina'' in ''Eranos'' '''52''' 1954 p. 105-119 partic. p. 116 n. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer too sees in her a military aspect.&lt;ref&gt;R. E. A. Palmer above p. 29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the etymology Cicero gives the verb ''monēre'' warn, hence ''the Warner''. Palmer accepts Cicero's etymology as a possibility while adding ''mons'' mount, hill, verb ''e-mineo'' and noun ''monile'' referred to the Capitol, place of her cult. Also perhaps a cultic term or even, as in her temple were kept the ''[[Linen Rolls|Libri Lintei]]'', ''monere'' would thence have the meaning of recording: [[Livius Andronicus]] identifies her as [[Mnemosyne]].

Her ''dies natalis'' was on the kalendae of June. Her Temple on the summit of the Capitol was dedicated only in 348 BC by dictator L. Furius Camillus, presumably a son of the great Furius. Livy states he vowed the temple during a war against the [[Aurunci]]. Modern scholars agree that the origins of the cult and of the temple were much more ancient.&lt;ref&gt;V. Basanoff citing Mancini&lt;/ref&gt; M. Guarducci considers her cult very ancient, identifying her with Mnemosyne as ''the Warner'' because of her presence near the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#auguraculum|auguraculum]], her oracular character, her announcement of perils: she considers her as an introduction into Rome of the [[Hera]] of [[Cuma (Italy)|Cuma]] dating to the 8th century. L. A. Mac Kay considers the goddess more ancient than her etymology on the testimony of [[Valerius Maximus]] who states she was the Juno of Veii. The sacred geese of the Capitol were lodged in her temple: as they are recorded in the episode of the Gallic siege (ca. 396-390 BC) by Livy, the temple should have existed before Furius's dedication.&lt;ref&gt;Official website of the Musei Capitolini, Comune di Roma, offering details on the location and architectural features of the temple. Cf. Livy V 54, 7 on the annual procession commemorating her role of saviour: in it the image of the goddess represented as a goose was taken from her sanctuary on the [[Arx (Roman)|Arx]] to the Capitoline temple, where she was placed in the sacellum of Iuventas, in the space between the cellae of Jupiter and Minerva.&lt;/ref&gt; Basanoff considers her to go back to the regal period: she would be the Sabine Juno who arrived at Rome through [[Cures, Sabinum|Cures]]. At Cures she was the tutelary deity of the military chief: as such she is never to be found among Latins. This new quality is apparent in the location of her ''fanum'', her name, her role: 1. her altar is located in the regia of Titus Tatius; 2. Moneta is, from ''monere'', ''the Adviser'': like [[Egeria (mythology)|Egeria]] with Numa (Tatius's son in law) she is associated to a Sabine king; 3. In [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] the altar-tables of the curiae are consecrated to Juno Curitis to justify the false etymology of Curitis from curiae: the tables would assure the presence of the tutelary ''numen'' of the king as an adviser within each curia, as the epithet itself implies.&lt;ref&gt;V. Basanoff, ''Junon falisque et ses cultes à Rome'' p. 110-141; Cicero ''de Domo Sua'' 38. 101; V. Basanoff ''Les dieux des Romains'' p. 151-152; Paulus-Festus s.v. curiales menses p. 56 L&lt;/ref&gt; It can be assumed thence that Juno Moneta intervenes under warlike circumstances as associated to the sacral power of the king.

===Juno Regina===
Juno Regina is perhaps the epithet most fraught with questions. While some scholars maintain she was known as such at Rome since the most ancient times as paredra (consort) of Jupiter in the [[Capitoline Triad]]&lt;ref&gt;V. Basanoff ''Les dieux des Romains'' p. 87; G. Dumézil ''La religion romaine archaique'' Paris 1974 p. 426; the triad had been already present in the [[Capitolium vetus]] prior to the dedication of the temple of the Capitol: Martial ''Epigrammata''; R. A. Lanciani ''Pagan and Christian Rome'' Boston &amp; New York 1893 p.190&lt;/ref&gt; others think she is a new acquisition introduced to Rome after her [[evocatio]] from Veii.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gagė "Matronalia" p. 80-81; Y. Roe D'Albret ''Recherches sur la prise de Véies et sur Iuno Regina'' in ''Annuaire de l'Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes'' IV 1975-6 p. 1093-1103&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmer&lt;ref&gt;R.E.A. Palmer above p. 21–29&lt;/ref&gt; thinks she is to be identified with Juno Populona of later inscriptions,&lt;ref&gt;CIL&lt;/ref&gt; a political and military poliadic (guardian) deity who had in fact a place in the Capitoline temple and was intended to represent the ''Regina'' of the king. The date of her introduction, though ancient, would be uncertain; she should perhaps be identified with [[Hera]] Basilea or as the queen of Jupiter Rex. The actual epithet Regina could though come from Veii. At Rome this epithet may have been applied to a Juno other than that of the temple on the Aventine built to lodge the evocated Veian Juno as the [[rex sacrorum]] and his wife-queen were to offer a monthly sacrifice to Juno in the Regia. This might imply that the prerepublican Juno was royal.
[[File:Denarius-Julia Soaemias-RIC 0237.jpg|thumb|280px|''IVNO REGINA'' ("Queen Juno") on a coin celebrating [[Julia Soaemias]]]]
J. Gagé dismisses these assumptions as groundless speculations as no Jupiter Rex is attested and in accord with Roe D'Albret stresses that at Rome no presence of a Juno Regina is mentioned before [[Marcus Furius Camillus]], while she is attested in many Etruscan and Latin towns. Before that time her Roman equivalent was Juno Moneta. Marcel Renard for his part considers her an ancient Roman figure since the title of the Veian Juno expresses a cultic reality that is close to and indeed presupposes the existence at Rome of an analogous character: as a rule it is the presence of an original local figure that may allow the introduction of the new one through evocatio. He agrees with Dumézil that we{{Who|date=July 2016}} ignore whether the translation of the epithet is exhaustive and what Etruscan notion corresponded to the name ''Regina'' which itself is certainly an Italic title.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ''La religion romaine archaique'' Paris 1974 p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; This is the only instance of evocatio recorded by the annalistic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Livy V 21; V 22, 3–7&lt;/ref&gt; However Renard considers Macrobius's authority reliable in his long list of ''evocationes''&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 9&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds of an archaeological find at [[Isaura]]. Roe D'Albret underlines the role played by Camillus and sees a personal link between the deity and her magistrate. Similarly Dumézil has remarked the link of Camillus with [[Mater Matuta]]. In his relationship to the goddess he takes the place of the king of Veii.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumerzil &amp; Udo Strutynsky ''Camillus; a study of Indoeuropean religion as Roman history '' 1980 Univ. of California Press p. 129 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Camillus's devotion to female deities Mater Matuta and [[Fortuna]] and his contemporary vow of a new temple to both Matuta and Iuno Regina hint to a degree of identity between them: this assumption has by chance been supported by the discovery at [[Pyrgi]] of a bronze lamella which mentions together [[Uni (mythology)|Uni]] and [[Thesan]], the Etruscan Juno and Aurora, i.e. Mater Matuta.&lt;ref&gt;Published by M. Pallottino in ''Archeologia Classica'' '''19''' 1967 p. 336 ff.: ''eta thesan etras uniịathi ba.../hutila tịna etiasa acaliạ.../tḥanchvilus catharnaia''. R. Bloch in ''Archeologia Classica'' ''' 21''' 1969 p. 58 ff. discussed the Roman identification with Mater Matuta and Iuno Lucina, i.e. Leukothea and Eileitheyia in their [[interpretatio graeca]].&lt;/ref&gt; One can then suppose Camillus's simultaneous vow of the temples of the two goddesses should be seen in the light of their intrinsic association. [[Octavianus]] will repeat the same translation with the statue of the Juno of [[Perusia]] in consequence of a dream&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius VXL 14, 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

That a goddess evoked in war and for political reasons receive the homage of women and that women continue to have a role in her cult is explained by Palmer&lt;ref&gt;R. E. A. Palmer above p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; as a foreign cult of feminine sexuality of Etruscan derivation. The persistence of a female presence in her cult through the centuries down to the [[lectisternium]] of 217 BC, when the ''matronae'' collected money for the service,&lt;ref&gt;Livy XXII 1, 17-19; Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 6, 12-14&lt;/ref&gt; and to the times of Augustus during the [[ludi saeculares]] in the sacrifices to Capitoline Juno are proof of the resilience of this foreign tradition.&lt;ref&gt;R.E.A. Palmer above p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horace Carmen Saeculare; E. Fraenkel ''Horace'' Oxford 1957 chapt. 7; G.B. Pighi ''De ludis saecularibus populi Romani Quiritium'' Pubbl. dell' Universitá Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Serie 5  '''35''' Milano 1941 p. 107-119; p. 201-221&lt;/ref&gt;

Gagé and D'Albret remark an accentuation of the matronal aspect of Juno Regina that led her to be the most matronal of the Roman goddesses by the time of the end of the republic. This fact raises the question of understanding why she was able of attracting the devotion of the ''matronae''. Gagé traces back the phenomenon to the nature of the cult rendered to the Juno Regina of the Aventine in which Camillus played a role in person. The original devotion of the ''matronae'' was directed to Fortuna. Camillus was devout to her and to Matuta, both matronal deities. When he brought Juno Regina from Veii the Roman women were already acquainted with many Junos, while the ancient rites of Fortuna were falling off. Camillus would have then made a political use of the cult of Juno Regina to subdue the social conflicts of his times by attributing to her the role of primordial mother.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil "Servius et la Fortune. Essai sur la fonction sociale du louange et de la blâme et sur les elements indo-européens du cens romain" ''Coll. Les Mythes Romains'' Paris 1943; J. Bayet ''Titus Livius V'' p. 154 and notes; J. Gagé "Matronalia" above p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Juno Regina had two temples (''aedes'') in Rome. The one dedicated by Furius Camillus in 392 BC stood on the [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]]: it lodged the wooden statue of the Juno transvected from Veii.&lt;ref&gt;Livy V 2, 1-3; Dionysius XIII 3; Plutarch ''Camillus'' 6; Valerius Maximus I 8, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; It is mentioned several times by Livy in connexion with sacrifices offered in atonement of [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#prodigium|prodigia]]. It was restored by Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;Monumentum Ancyranum IV 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Two inscriptions found near the church of S. Sabina indicate the approximate site of the temple, which corresponds with its place in the lustral procession of 207 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Livy XXVII 37, 7&lt;/ref&gt; near the upper end of the Clivus Publicius. The day of the dedication and of her festival was September 1.

Another temple stood near the [[circus Flaminius]], vowed by consul [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 187 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]] in 187&amp;nbsp;BC during the war against the [[Ligures]] and dedicated by himself as censor in 179&lt;ref&gt;Livy XL 52, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; on December 23.&lt;ref&gt;Fasti Antiates apud NS 1921 p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; It was connected by a porch with a temple of Fortuna,&lt;ref&gt;Iulius Obsequens 14.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps that of Fortuna Equestris. Its probable site according to Platner is just south of the [[Theatre of Pompey|porticus Pompeiana]] on the west end of circus Flaminius.&lt;ref&gt;S. Ball Platner &amp; T. Ashby ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' London 1929 p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Juno Cealestis of Carthage [[Tanit]] was [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#evocatio|evoked]] according to Macrobius. She did not receive a temple in Rome: presumably her image was deposited in another temple of Juno (Moneta or Regina) and later transferred to the [[Colonia Junonia]] founded by [[Gaius Gracchus|Caius Gracchus]].&lt;ref&gt;V. Basanoff ''Evocatio: Iuno Caelestis de Carthage. I Exoratio. II Evocatio'' p. 63–66; G. Dumézil ARR Paris 1974 p. 468; G. Ch. Picard ''Les religions de l'Afrique antique'' Paris 1954 p. 568; Plutarch ''Caius Gracchus'' II; Solinus XXVIII 11; Macrobius III 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The goddess was once again transferred to Rome by emperor [[Elagabalus]].

===Juno in the Capitoline triad===
The first mention of a Capitoline triad refers to the ''Capitolium Vetus''.&lt;ref&gt;A backformation hinting to the association of the three deities in a temple site before the founding of that of Iupiter Capitolinus. Its existence is attested by Varro ‘'Lingua Latina‘' V 149； Martial ''Epigrammata'' V 22, 4; VI 74, 34. Archaeologically: cf. R. A. Lanciani ''Pagan and Christian Rome'' Boston and New York, 1893 p. 190: Lanciani states it was found and demolished in 1625 by order of Pope [[Barberini]]. E. Gjerstad ''Early Rome'' V p. 63-64 thinks of a dating after 575 BC. Other scholars put its founding at 580 BC, during the reign of [[Tarquinius Priscus]].&lt;/ref&gt; The only ancient source who refers to the presence of this divine triad in Greece is [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] X 5, 1-2, who mentions its existence in describing the Φωκικόν in [[Phocis]].&lt;ref&gt;"On the way leading directly from Deulis to Delphi, on the left hand side...; there the towns of Phocis hold their common assemblies...the building is very large, supported by rows of columns. Steps on which the representatives sit stand between the columns and the walls. At the back there are...only the statues of Zeus, Hera and Athena. Zeus in the middle on a throne, the goddesses on the two sides, Hera at his right and Athena at his left."&lt;/ref&gt; The Capitoline triad poses difficult interpretative problems. It looks peculiarly Roman, since there is no sure document of its existence elsewhere either in Latium or Etruria.&lt;ref&gt;Luisa Banti "Il culto del cosiddetto tempio di Apollo a Veii ed il problema delle triadi etrusco-italiche" in ''Studi Etruschi'' '''17''' 1943 p. 187-224.&lt;/ref&gt; A direct Greek influence is possible but it would be also plausible to consider it a local creation.&lt;ref&gt;M. Renard cites the discovery of an inscription dedicated to ''Castorei Podluqueique qurois'' at the Lavinium 13 altars site: F. Castagnoli "Dedica arcaica lavinate a Castore e Polluce" in ''Studi e Materiali di Storia delle Religioni'' '''30''' 1959 p. 109-117; S. Weinstock  "Two archaic inscriptions from Lavinium" in ''Journal of Roman Studies'' '''50''' 1960 p. 112ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ugo Bianchi ''Disegno storico del culto capitolino nell'Italia romana e nelle province dell' Impero'' Accademia dei Lincei. Memorie. Serie VIII 2 1949 p. 317-415&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil advanced the hypothesis it could be an ideological construction of the Tarquins to oppose new Latin nationalism, as it included the three gods that in the Iliad are enemies of [[Troy]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ''Myth et Epopée'' III: part III chapt. 1 Paris 1973; ''La religion romaine archaïque'' Paris 1974 part II chapt. 1; It. tr. Milano 1977 p. 276 n. 31&lt;/ref&gt; It is probable Latins had already accepted the legend of Aeneas as their ancestor. Among ancient sources&lt;ref&gt;Servius ''Aen.'' I 422; Vitruvius ''De architectura'' I 7&lt;/ref&gt; indeed Servius states that according to the [[Etruscan mythology#Etrusca Disciplina|Etrusca Disciplina]] towns should have the three temples of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva at the end of three roads leading to three gates. [[Vitruvius]] writes that the temples of these three gods should be located on the most elevated site, isolated from the other. To his Etruscan founders the meaning of this triad might have been related to peculiarly Etruscan ideas on the association of the three gods with the birth of [[Herakles]] and the siege of Troy, in which [[Minerva]] plays a decisive role as a goddess of destiny along with the sovereign couple Uni Tinia.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ''La religion romaine archaique''  Paris 1974 part II chapt 1; It. tr. p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Junos of Latium===
The cults of the Italic Junos reflected remarkable theological complexes: regality, military protection and fertility.

In Latium are relatively well known the instances of Tibur, Falerii, Laurentum and Lanuvium.

At Tibur and Falerii their ''sacerdos'' was a male, called ''pontifex sacrarius'', a fact that has been seen as a proof of the relevance of the goddess to the whole society. In both towns she was known as ''Curitis'', the spearholder, an armed protectress.&lt;ref&gt;Servius ''Aen'' I 17 and 8; Martianus Capella II 149.&lt;/ref&gt; The martial aspect of these Junos is conspicuous, quite as much as that of fecundity and regality: the first two look strictly interconnected: fertility guaranteed the survival of the community, peaceful and armed. Iuno Curitis is also the tutelary goddess of the ''curiae'' and of the new brides, whose hair was combed with the spear called ''caelibataris hasta'' as in Rome. In her annual rites at Falerii youths and maiden clad in white bore in procession gifts to the goddess whose image was escorted by her priestesses. The idea of purity and virginity is stressed in Ovid's description. A she goat is sacrificed to her after a ritual hunting. She is then the patroness of the young soldiers and of brides.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P. Harmon "Religion in the Latin Elegists" in ANRW 1986 p. 1971-3: K. Latte ''Römische Religionsgeschichte'' Munich 1960 p. 168; Ovid ''Amores'' III 13; Festus s.v. Curritis p. 55 L&lt;/ref&gt;

At Lanuvium the goddess is known under the epithet Seispes Mater Regina.&lt;ref&gt;CIL XIV I(VNONI) S. M. R.2091; 2088; 2089; 2121; IUNONE SEISPITEI MATRI REGINAE 2090&lt;/ref&gt; The titles themselves are a theological definition: she was a sovereign goddess, a martial goddess and a fertility goddess.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ''La religion romaine archaique'' Paris 1974 part II chapt. 1. 2; It. tr. Milano 1977 p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; Hence her [[flamen]] was chosen by the highest local magistrate, the dictator, and since 388 BC the Roman consuls were required to offer sacrifices to her.&lt;ref&gt;Livy VIII 14, 2; Cicero ''Pro Milone'' 17 and 45; ''Pro Murena'' 51 and 90&lt;/ref&gt; Her sanctuary was famous, rich and powerful.

Her cult included the annual feeding of a sacred snake with barley cakes by virgin maidens. The snake dwelt in a deep cave within the precinct of the temple, on the ''arx'' of the city: the maidens approached the lair blindfolded. The snake was supposed to feed only on the cakes offered by chaste girls. The rite was aimed at ensuring agricultural fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P. Harmon above p. 1971; Properce IV 8; Aelian ''De Natura Animalium'' XI 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The site of the temple as well as the presence of the snake show she was the tutelary goddess of the city, as Athena at Athens and Hera at Argos.&lt;ref&gt;G. Bendinelli "Monumenti Lanuvini" in ''Monumenti dei Lincei'' '''27''' 1921 p. 294-370; Properce IV 8, 3 defines the ''annosus draco'' old dragon the ''tutela'' of Lanuvium.&lt;/ref&gt; The motif of the snake of the palace as guardian goddess of the city is shared by Iuno Seispes with Athena, as well as its periodic feeding.&lt;ref&gt;Harmon above p. 1973; Herodotus VIII 41.&lt;/ref&gt; This religious pattern moreover includes armour, goatskin dress, sacred birds and a concern with virginity in cult. Virginity is connected to regality: the existence and welfare of the community was protected by virgin goddesses or the virgin attendants of a goddess.&lt;ref&gt;D. P. Harmon above citing G. Dumézil ''Archaic Roman Religion'' p. 586: the Welsh king Math could live only if he kept his feet on the lap of a virgin, except at wartime.&lt;/ref&gt; This theme shows a connexion with the fundamental theological character of Iuno, that of incarnating vital force: virginity is the condition of unspoilt, unspent vital energy that can ensure communion with nature and its rhythm, symbolised in the fire of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]]. It is a decisive factor in ensuring the safety of the community and the growth of crops. The role of Iuno is at the crossing point of civil and natural life, expressing their interdependence.&lt;ref&gt;A. Brelich "Vesta" ''Albae Vigiliae'' n. s. 7 Zurich 1949 p. 48-57: D. P. Harmon above; R.E.A. Palmer above p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Laurentum]] she was known as Kalendaris Iuno and was honoured as such ritually at the kalendae of each month from March to December, i.e. the months of the [[Numa Pompilius|pre-Numan]] ten-month year, a fact which is a testimony to the antiquity of the custom.&lt;ref&gt;M. Renard "Iuno Covella" ''Annales de l'Institut de Philologie Orientale et Slave'' '''12''' 1952 p. 401-8, esp. p. 408; Servius ''Aen.'' VIII 654 attributes the institution of the ceremony to Romolus; Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 15, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Greek influence in their cults looks probable.&lt;ref&gt;Lanuvium considered [[Diomedes]] as its founder hero: Appian ''B.C.'' II 20; Aelian ''De Natura Animalium'' XI 16 calls the local Iuno ''Hera Argolis'' in the description of the serpent cult; at Tibur "Iuno Argeia" is found on an inscription: CIL XIV 3556; Hera Argeia or Iuno Argiva at Falerii: Dionysius of Halicarnassus I 21, 1-2; Ovid ''Amores'' III 13, 31; J. Berard ''La colonisation grecque de l'Italie meridinale et de la Siclie dans l'Antiquité'' Paris 1957 p. 393-4&lt;/ref&gt; It is noteworthy though that Cicero remarked the existence of a stark difference between the Latin Iuno Seispes and the Argolic Hera (as well the Roman Iuno) in his work [[De natura deorum]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''De natura deorum'' I 29, 82: "At non-est talis Argia nec Romana Iuno. Ergo alia species Iunonis Argivis alia Lanuvinis".&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius Helianus later wrote "...she has much new of Hera Argolis"&lt;ref&gt;Claudius Helianus ''De natura animalium'' XI 16: "...και έχει πλησίον νεών Ήρας Αργολίδος".&lt;/ref&gt; The iconography of Argive Hera, matronal and regal, looks quite far away from the warlike and savage character of Iuno Seispes, especially considering that it is uncertain whether the former was an armed Hera.&lt;ref&gt;A. Pasqualini "Diomede nel Lazio e le tradizioni leggendarie sulla fondazione di Lanuvio" in ''MEFRA'' '''110''' 1998 2 p. 672 n. 59 with bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the definitive subjugation of the [[Latin League]] in 338 BC the Romans required as a condition of peace the condominium of the Roman people on the sanctuary and the sacred grove of Juno Seispes in Lanuvium, while bestowing Roman citizenry on the Lanuvians.&lt;ref&gt;Livy VIII 14, 2; Silius Italicus VIII 360&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the ''prodigia'' (supernatural or unearthly phenomena) which happened in her temple were referred to Rome and accordingly expiated there. Many occurred during the presence of [[Hannibal]] in Italy. Perhaps the Romans were not completely satisfied with this solution as in 194 BC consul [[Gaius Cornelius Cethegus|C. Cornelius Cethegus]] erected a temple to the ''Juno Sospita'' of Lanuvium in the Forum Holitorium (vowed three years earlier in a war with the [[Insubres|Galli Insubri]]):&lt;ref&gt;Livy XXXII 30, 10; XXXIV 53, 3&lt;/ref&gt;); in it the goddess was honoured in military garb.  The [[flamen]] or special priest belonging to Juno Seispes continued to be a Lanuvian, specially nominated by the town to take care of the goddess even though she was housed in her temple at Rome (in the Forum Holitorium). At the time of [[Cicero]], [[Titus Annius Milo|Milo]], who served as the city's dictator and highest magistrate in 52 BC (Cic. Mil. 27), and of course was also a Roman citizen (he had been [[tribune of the plebs]] in 57 BC), resided in Rome. When he fatally met [[Clodius]] near [[Bovillae]] (Milo's slaves killed Clodius in that encounter), he was on his way to Lanuvium in order to nominate the [[flamen]] of Juno Seispes.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''Pro Milone'' 27 and 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theological and comparative study==
The complexity of the figure of Juno has caused much uncertainty and debate among modern scholars. Some emphasize one aspect or character of the goddess, considering it as primary: the other ones would then be the natural and even necessary development of the first. Palmer and Harmon consider it to be the natural vital force of youthfulness, Latte women's fecundity. These original characters would have led to the formation of the complex theology of Juno as a sovereign and an armed tutelary deity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}
[[File:Iuno Petit Palais ADUT00168.jpg|thumb|250px|Juno. Silver statuette, 1st–2nd century.]]
[[Georges Dumézil]] on the other hand proposed the theory of the irreducibility and interdependence of the three aspects (sovereignty, war, fertility) in goddesses that he interprets as an original, irreducible structure as hypothesised in his [[trifunctional hypothesis|hypothesis of the trifunctional ideology]] of the [[Proto-Indo-European society|Indoeuropean]]s. While Dumézil's refusal of seeing a Greek influence in Italic Junos looks difficult to maintain&lt;ref&gt;G. Pugliese Carratelli "Culti e dottrine religiose in Magna Gaecia" in ''La parola del Passato'' '''20''' 1965 p.&amp;nbsp;1-ff.; also other works by the same author, Jean Berard and Mario Torelli cited below at note n.&amp;nbsp;164.&lt;/ref&gt; in the light of the contributions of archaeology, his comparative analysis of the divine structure is supported by many scholars, as M. Renard and J. Poucet. His theory purports that while male gods incarnated one single function, there are female goddesses who make up a synthesis of the three functions, as a reflection of the ideal of woman's role in society. Even though such a deity has a peculiar affinity for one function, generally fertility, i. e. the third, she is nevertheless equally competent in each of the three.

As concrete instances Dumézil makes that of Vedic goddess [[Sarasvatī]] and Avestic [[Anahita|Anāhīta]]. Sarasvati as river goddess is first a goddess of the third function, of vitality and fertility&lt;ref&gt;Ṛig Veda II 41, 17&lt;/ref&gt; associated to the deities of the third function as the [[Ashvins|Aśvin]] and of propagation as [[Sinivali|Sinīvalī]]. She is ''the mother'' and on her rely all vital forces.&lt;ref&gt;Above II 41, 16: "Sarasvati the most mother, the most river, the most divine"; II 41, 17&lt;/ref&gt; But at the same time she belongs to the first function as a religious sovereign: she is pure,&lt;ref&gt;Above I 10, 30&lt;/ref&gt; she is the means of purifications and helps the conceiving and realisation of pious thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Above II 3, 8; I 3, 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly she is also a warrior: allied with the [[Maruts]] she annihilates the enemies&lt;ref&gt;Above II 30, 8&lt;/ref&gt; and, sole among female goddesses, bears the epithet of the warrior god [[Indra]], [[Verethragna|vṛtraghnỉ]], ''destroyer of oppositions''.&lt;ref&gt;Above VI 61, 7&lt;/ref&gt; She is the common spouse of all the heroes of the [[Mahābhārata]], sons and heirs of the Vedic gods [[Dharma]], [[Vāyu]], [[Indra]] and of the Aśvin twins. Though in hymns and rites her threefold nature is never expressed conjointly (except in Ṛg Veda VI 61, 12:: ''triṣadásthā'' having three seats).

Only in her Avestic equivalent Anahita, the great mythic river, does she bear the same three valences explicitly: her [[Yašt]] states she is invoked by warriors, by clerics and by deliverers.&lt;ref&gt;Yt. V 85-87&lt;/ref&gt; She bestows on females an easy delivery and timely milking. She bestowed on heroes the vigour by which they defeated their demonic adversaries. She is the great purifier, "she who puts the worshipper in the ritual, pure condition" (''yaož dā'').&lt;ref&gt;Yasna LXV 2 and 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Her complete name too is threefold: ''The Wet (''Arədvī''), The Strong (''Sūrā''), The Immaculate (''Anāhitā'')''.

Dumézil remarks these titles match perfectly those of Latin Junos, especially the Juno Seispes Mater Regina of Lanuvium, the only difference being in the religious orientation of the first function. Compare also the epithet Fluonia, Fluviona of Roman Juno, discussed by G. Radke.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil "Juno S. M. R." in ''Eranos'' '''52''' 1954 p.&amp;nbsp;105&amp;ndash;119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Radke ''Die Götter Altitaliens'' Münster 1965 article Fluonia, Fluviona.&lt;/ref&gt; However D. P. Harmon has remarked that the meaning of Seispes cannot be seen as limited to the warrior aspect, as it implies a more complex, comprehensive function, i. e. of Saviour.&lt;ref&gt;D. P. Harmon "Religion in the Latin Elegists" in ''ANRW'' p. 197 .&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Germanic peoples the homologous goddess was bivalent, as a rule the military function was subsumed into the sovereign: goddess  *Frīy(y)o- was at the same time sovereign, wife of the great god, and [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] (thence *Friy(y)a-dagaz "Freitag for Veneris dies). However the internal tension of the character led to a duplication in Scandinavian religion: [[Frigg]] resulted in a merely sovereign goddess, the spouse of wizard god [[Óðinn]], while from the name of [[Freyr]], typical god of the third function, was extracted a second character, [[Freyja]], confined as a [[Vani]] to the sphere of pleasure and wealth.

Dumézil opines that the theologies of ancient Latium could have preserved a composite image of the goddess and this fact, notably her feature of being ''Regina'', would in turn have rendered possible her ''interpretatio'' as Hera.

==Associations with other deities==

===Juno and Jupiter===
[[File:Carracci - Jupiter et Junon.jpeg|thumb|right|''[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and Juno'', by [[Annibale Carracci]].]]
The divine couple received from Greece its matrimonial implications, thence bestowing on Juno the role of tutelary goddess of marriage (''Iuno Pronuba'').

The association of Juno and Jupiter is of the most ancient Latin theology.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil "Déesses latines et mythes vediques. III Fortuna Primigenia" in ''Coll. Latomus'' '''25''' 1956 p. 71-78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Praeneste]] offers a glimpse into original Latin mythology: the local goddess [[Fortuna]] is represented as nursing two infants, one male and one female, namely [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jove]] (Jupiter) and Juno.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''De nat. Deor.'' II 85-86: "Is est locus saeptus religiose propter Iovis pueri, qui lactens cum Iunone in gremio sedens, mamma appetens, castissime colitur a matribus": "This is an enclosed place for religious reasons because of Iupiter child, who is seated on the womb with Juno suckling, directed towards the breast, very chastely worshipped by mothers".&lt;/ref&gt; It seems fairly safe to assume that from the earliest times they were identified by their own proper names and since they got them they were never changed through the course of history: they were called Jupiter and Juno. These gods were the most ancient deities of every Latin town. Praeneste preserved divine filiation and infancy as the sovereign god and his paredra Juno have a mother who is the primordial goddess Fortuna Primigenia.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ''Déesses latines et mythes vediques'' p. 96 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Many terracotta statuettes have been discovered which represent a woman with a child: one of them represents exactly the scene described by Cicero of a woman with two children of different sex who touch her breast. Two of the votive inscriptions to Fortuna associate her and Jupiter: " Fortunae Iovi puero..." and "Fortunae Iovis puero..."&lt;ref&gt;CIL XIV 2868 and 2862 (mutile).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1882 R. Mowat published an inscription in which Fortuna is called ''daughter of Jupiter'', raising new questions and opening new perspectives in the theology of Latin gods.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mowat "Inscription latine sur plaque de bronze acquise à Rome par par M. A. Dutuit"  in ''Mem. de la Soc. nat. des Antiquités de France'' 5me Ser. 3  '''43''' 1882 p. 200: CIL XIV 2863: ORCEVIA NUMERI/ NATIONU CRATIA/  FORTUNA DIOVO FILEA/ PRIMOCENIA/ DONOM DEDI. Cited by G. Dumézil above p. 71 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil has elaborated an interpretative theory according to which this contradiction would be an intrinsic, fundamental feature of Indoeuropean deities of the primordial and sovereign level, as it finds a parallel in Vedic religion.&lt;ref&gt;G Dumézil ''Déesses latines et mythes vediques'' Bruxelles 1956 chapt. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The contradiction would put Fortuna both at the origin of time and into its ensuing diachronic process: it is the comparison offered by Vedic deity [[Aditi]], the ''Not-Bound'' or ''Enemy of Bondage'', that shows that there is no question of choosing one of the two apparent options: as the mother of the [[Aditya]] she has the same type of relationship with one of his sons, [[Daksha|Dakṣa]], the minor sovereign who represents the ''Creative Energy'', being at the same time his mother and daughter, as is true for the whole group of sovereign gods to which she belongs.&lt;ref&gt;Ṛg-Veda X 72, 4-5; G. Dumézil above and ''Mariages indo-européens'' p. 311-312: "Of Aditi Daksa was born, and of Daksa Aditi, o Daksa, she who is your daughter".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juno and Janus===
The relationship of the female sovereign deity with the god of beginnings and passages is reflected mainly in their association with the [[kalendae]] of every month, which belong to both, and in the festival of the [[Tigillum Sororium]] of October 1.

Janus as gatekeeper of the gates connecting Heaven and Earth and guardian of all passages is particularly related to time and motion. He holds the first place in ritual invocations and prayers, in order to ensure the communication between the worshipper and the gods. He enjoys the privilege of receiving the first sacrifice of the new year, which is offered by the ''rex'' on the day of the [[Agonalia|Agonium]] of January as well as at the kalendae of each month: These rites show he is considered the patron of the cosmic year. Ovid in his ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' has Janus say that he is the original Chaos and also the first era of the world, which got organised only afterwards. He preserves a tutelary function on this universe as the gatekeeper of Heaven. His nature, qualities and role are reflected in the myth of him being the first to reign in Latium, on the banks of the Tiber, and there receiving  the god [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], in the age when the Earth could still bear gods.&lt;ref&gt;R. Schilling "Janus dieu introducteur, dieu des passages" in ''Melanges d'Archeologie et d' Histoire'' 1960 p. 91-131; Ovid ''Fasti'' I 103-139.&lt;/ref&gt; The theology of Janus is also presented in the [[carmen Saliare]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Maurenbrecher's reading, (after Schilling, above): "1.Divom patrem canite, divom deum supplicate; 2.Patulci cosmis. Es duonus Sancus Ianius, es duonus Cerus es Ianeus; 3.Potissimum meliosum recum; 4.Ianituos".&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Johannes Lydus]] the Etruscans called him Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Lydus ''De Menisbus'' IV 2: citing Varro.&lt;/ref&gt; His epithets are numerous&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius I 9, 15: "In sacris...invocamus Ianum Geminum, I. Patrem, I. Iunonium, I. Consivium, I. Quirinum, I. Patultium and Clusivium."; other preserved by Lydus IV 2 correspond to Ianualis (from the cake ianual eaten on the kalendae), Cenulum and Cibullum: cf.R. Schilling above p. 97; G. Capdeville "Les epithets cultuelles de Janus" in ''MEFR(A)'' '''85''' 1975 2 p. 395-436, who rejects ''cibullum'' as a glossa of Cedrenus' s.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iunonius'' is particularly relevant, as the god of the kalendae who cooperates with and is the source of the youthful vigour of Juno in the birth of the new lunar month.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius above, quotes Varro ''Antiquitates Rerum Divinarum'' V, as saying that Janus had twelve altars, one for each month.&lt;/ref&gt; His other epithet ''Consivius'' hints to his role in the generative function.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Sat.'' I 9, 16: "Consivius a conserendo, id est a propagine generis humani quae Iano auctore conseritur": "Consivius from insemination, i.e. from the propagation of mankind who is sown having Janus as author." ; Tertullian ''Ad Nationes'' II 11: "deus Conseuius.... qui consationibus concubitalibus praesit." " god Conseuius who presides on sowing and sexual intercourse": here Tertullian has preserved the most ancient form, even though he is not aware it is an epithet of Ianus (Capdeville above p. 433); August. ''C. D.'' VII 2 "...Ianus, cum puerperium concipitur...aditum aperit recipiendi semini." "J. at the start of pregnancy...opens the way in to the reception of the sperm".&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the two gods at the kalendae of every month is that of presiding over the birth of the new moon. Janus and Juno cooperate as the first looks after the passage from the previous to the ensuing month while the second helps it through the strength of her vitality. The rites of the kalendae included the invocations to Juno Covella, giving the number of days to the ''nonae'', a sacrifice to Janus by the rex sacrorum and the pontifex minor at the ''curia Calabra'' and one to Juno by the regina sacrorum in the Regia: originally when the month was still lunar the ''pontifex minor'' had the task of signalling the appearance of the new moon. While the meaning of the epithet Covella is unknown and debated,&lt;ref&gt;[[Scaliger]] proposed a derivation from ''cohum'' heaven, sky on the grounds of Paulus p. 34 L: "cohum caelum poetae dixerunt"; M. Renard "Aspects anciens de Janus et Junon" ''Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire'' 1953 and ''Annuaire de l'institut de philologie orientale et slave'' 1953 from the parallel etymology of ''iunix'' heifer and Iuno proposed the IE root for bovines *g(w)ou- (that gave English cow) and also ''cava'' caved in, inflected, etymology proposed also by Latte.&lt;/ref&gt; that of the rituals is clear as the divine couple is supposed to oversee, protect and help the moon during the particularly dangerous time of her darkness and her ''labours'': the role of Juno Covella is hence the same as that of Lucina for women during parturition. The association of the two gods is reflected on the human level at the difficult time of labours as is apparent in the custom of putting a key, symbol of Janus, in the hand of the woman with the aim of ensuring an easy delivery, while she had to invoke Juno Lucina.&lt;ref&gt;Schilling above p. 116; Paulus p. 49 L&lt;/ref&gt; At the nonae Caprotinae similarly Juno had the function of aiding and strengthening the moon as the nocturnal light, at the time when her force was supposed to be at its lowest, after the Summer solstice.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tigillum Sororium was a rite (sacrum) of the gens [[Horatia (gens)|Horatia]] and later of the State. In it ''Janus Curiatius'' was associated to ''Juno Sororia'': they had their altars on opposite sides of the alley behind the Tigillum Sororium. Physically this consisted of a beam spanning the space over two posts. It was kept in good condition down to the time of Livy at public expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Livy I 26, 13&lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition it was a rite of purification that served at the expiation of [[Horatii|Publius Horatius]] who had murdered his own sister when he saw her mourning the death of her betrothed Curiatius. Dumézil has shown in his ''Les Horaces et les Curiaces''&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ''Les Horaces et les Curiaces'' Paris 1942&lt;/ref&gt; that this story is in fact the historical transcription of rites of reintegration into civil life of the young warriors, in the myth symbolised by the hero, freed from their ''furor'' (wrath), indispensable at war but dangerous in social life. What is known of the rites of October 1 shows at Rome the legend has been used as an aetiological myth for the yearly purification ceremonies which allowed the ''desacralisation'' of soldiers at the end of the warring season, i.e. their cleansing from the religious pollution contracted at war. The story finds parallels in Irish and Indian mythologies. These rites took place in October, the month that at Rome saw the celebration of the end of the yearly military activity. Janus would then be the patron of the ''feria'' as god of transitions, Juno for her affinities to Janus, especially on the day of the kalendae. It is also possible though that she took part as the tutelary goddess of young people, the ''iuniores'', etymologically identical to her.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Turchi ''La religione di Roma antica'' Bologna 1939 p. 99 ff.; Marcel Renard ''Aspects anciens de Janus et de Junon'' in ''Revue belge de philologie'' '''31''' 1953 p. 13; G. Capdeville above p.430.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars are divided on the interpretation of J. Curiatius and J. Sororia. Renard citing Capdeville opines that the wisest choice is to adhere to tradition and consider the legend itself as the source of the epithets.&lt;ref&gt;G. Capdeville above p. 430-431&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For other interpretations cf.: H. J. Rose "Mana in Greece and Rome" in ''Harvard Theological Review'' '''42''' 1949 p. 165-169; M. Renard "Aspects anciens de Janus et Junon" in ''Revue belge de philologie'' '''31''' 1959 p.14f.; R. Schilling "Janus dieu introducteur, dieu des passages" above p. 108ff. ; J. Gagé "La poutre sacrée des Horatii" in ''Hommages Deonna'', ''Collection Latomus'' '''28''' Bruxelles 1957 p. 235 ff.; G. Dury Moyaers et Marcel Renard "Aperçu critique des travaux relatifs au culte de Junon" in ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der Römische Welt'' 1981 p. 186-188. These works though being all inspired by Rose's interpretation of ''sororia'' as an epithet related to the swelling of breasts in adolescent girls (based on Festus's glossa s.v. ''sororiare''), differ widely from one another. However, they all consider the feria to be related to an initiation into adult life and/or reintegration into civil life of young soldiers, the ''iuvenes''. According to Capdeville and Dury Moyaers &amp; Renard the main defect of all the proposed interpretations is that they are highly speculative, i.e. not grounded onto sufficient evidence in ancient sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

M. Renard advanced the view that Janus and not Jupiter was the original paredra or consort of Juno, on the grounds of their many common features, functions and appearance in myth or rites as is shown by their cross coupled epithets Janus Curiatius and Juno Sororia: Janus shares the epithet of Juno Curitis and Juno the epithet Janus Geminus, as ''sororius'' means paired, double.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. also Virgil's and Ovid's ascribing of analogous actions, if opposite in aim, to the two gods in the wars of Aeneas (Vergil ''Aen.'' VII 620-2: Servius comments ''Ianus Iunonius'' quoting these verses on Juno's opening of the gate of the Ianua Belli of the town of [[Latinus]]) and that between Sabines and Romans: Juno opens the bolts of the Ianualis Gate thrice, then Janus opens the Lautolae hot source that scorches the Sabines; Ovid ''Metamorphoses'' XIV 778-804; ''Fasti'' I 265-272). On the last episode cf. also Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 9 17-18, who however does not mention Juno as the author of the miracle.&lt;/ref&gt; Renard's theory has been rejected by G. Capdeville as not being in accord with the level of sovereign gods in Dumézil's trifunctional structure. The theology of Janus would show features typically belonging to the order of the gods of the beginning. In Capdeville's view it is only natural that a god of beginnings and a sovereign mother deity have common features, as all births can be seen as beginnings, Juno is invoked by deliverers, who by custom hold a key, symbol of Janus.&lt;ref&gt;Capdeville "Les epithets cultelles de Janus" above p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juno and Hercules===
Even though the origins of [[Hercules]] are undoubtedly Greek his figure underwent an early assimilation into Italic local religions and might even preserve traces of an association to Indoiranian deity [[Sancus#Trita Apya|Trita Apya]] that in Greece have not survived.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Woodard ''Indoeuropean Sacred Space: Vedic and Roman Cult'' Chicago 2006 p. 220 ff.; G. Dury Moyaers et M. Renard above p.188&lt;/ref&gt; Among other roles that Juno and Hercules share there is the protection of the newborn. [[Jean Bayet]], author of ''Les origines de l'Arcadisme romain'', has argued that such a function must be a later development as it looks to have superseded that of the two original Latin gods [[Picumnus]] and [[Pilumnus]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Bayet ''Les origines de l'Hercule romain'' Paris 1926 p.383-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The two gods are mentioned together in a dedicatory inscription found in the ruins of the temple of Hercules at Lanuvium, whose cult was ancient and second in importance only to that of Juno Sospita.&lt;ref&gt;Ephemer. Epigraph. IX 605: "Herculi San[cto] et Iunoni Sospit[i]". The inscription is dated to the 2nd century BC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bayet above p. 387; R. A. Lanciani ''Storia degli scavi'' Roma 1902-1912 III p. 22 and 31; D. Vaglieri "Civita Lavinia. Scoperta di anitchitá nel territorio del Comune" ''Atti della reale Accademia nazionale dei Lincei'' anno 304 V serie 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; In the cults of this temple just like in those at the [[Ara maxima]] in Rome women were not allowed. The exclusion of one sex is a characteristic practice in the cults of deities of fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian ''Ad nationes'' II 7: Bayet above p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; Even though no text links the cults of the Ara maxima with Juno Sospita, her temple, founded in 193 BC, was located in the [[Forum Holitorium]] near the [[Porta Carmentalis]], one of the sites of the legend of Hercules in Rome. The feria of the goddess coincides with a ''Natalis Herculis'', birthday of Hercules, which was celebrated with ''ludi circenses'', games in the circus.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wissowa ''Religion und Kultus der Römer'' Munich 1912 p. 276 n. 5; J. Bayet above p. 387-8; Properce ''Elegiae'' V 9, 71 "Sancte Pater salve, cui iam favet aspera Iuno" "Hail Thee Holy Father, to whom the harsh Iuno is propitious", at the end of a passage devoted to the legend of [[Bona Dea]] and of the Ara Maxima. Cf. Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 12, 28&lt;/ref&gt; In Bayet's view Juno and Hercules did supersede Pilumnus and Picumnus in the role of tutelary deities of the newborn not only because of their own features as goddess of the deliverers and as apotropaic tutelary god of infants but also because of their common quality as gods of fertility. This was the case in Rome and at [[Tusculum]] where a cult of Juno Lucina and Hercules was known.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bayet above p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; At Lanuvium and perhaps Rome though their most ancient association rests on their common fertility and military characters. The Latin Junos certainly possessed a marked warlike character (at Lanuvium, Falerii, Tibur, Rome). Such a character might suggest a comparison with the Greek armed [[Hera]]s one finds in the South of Italy at [[Promunturium Lacinium|Cape Lacinion]] and at the mouth of river [[Sele (river)|Sele]], military goddesses close to the Heras of [[Elis]] and [[Argos]] known as ''Argivae''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bayet above p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; In the cult this Hera received at Cape Lacinion she was associated with Heracles, supposed to be the founder of the sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;Servius ''Aen.'' III 552; J. Bayet above p. 170: the immortality of Heracles was ensured by Hera rather than being hindered by her.&lt;/ref&gt; Contacts with Central Italy and similarity would have favoured a certain assimilation between Latin warlike Junos and Argive Heras and the association with Heracles of Latin Junos. Some scholars, mostly Italians, recognize in the Junos of Falerii, Tibur and Lavinium the Greek Hera, rejecting the theory of an indigenous original cult of a military Juno.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mario Torelli]] "Il santuario greco di Gravisca" in ''La Parola del Passato'' '''32''' 1977 p. 435 on the Samian presence that gave an Argive connotation to the cult of Hera in Italy, archaic Argive Hellenisation of Falerii; M.

On the origin of Argive Hera Berard argues that given the Thessalic character of the legend of the Argonauts, her name evokes the Argos of Thessaly. On the other hand the cult of the Hera of the Sele would have been brought during prehistoric colonisations by the Amineans, a Pelasgian people issued from Thessaly (cf. Dionysius of Halicarnassus I 17, 2 and 89, 2). At the time of the first colonisation at the middle of the 7th century, the Trezenians, [[Doric Greek|Doric]] people from the [[Peloponnesus]] ([[Argolid]]) expelled from [[Sybaris]] by the Acheans (Herodotus VIII 43; Pausanias III 30, 10) settled at [[Posidonia]] where they inherited and took on the sanctuary founded by their predecessors: cf. P. C. Sestieri "Richerche posidionati" ''MEFR(A)'' '''67''' 1955 p. 35-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Renard thinks Dumézil's opposition to such a view is to be upheld: Bayet's words though did not deny the existence of local warlike Junos, but only imply that at a certain time they received the influence of the Heras of Lacinion and Sele, a fact that earned them the epithet of ''Argive'' and a Greek connotation.&lt;ref&gt;J. Bayet above p. 170-1&lt;/ref&gt; However Bayet recognized the quality of mother and of fertility deity as being primitive among the three purported by the epithets of the Juno of Lanuvium (Seispes, Mater, Regina).&lt;ref&gt;J. Bayet above p. 386&lt;/ref&gt;

Magna Graecia and Lanuvium mixed their influence in the formation of the Roman Hercules and perhaps there was a Sabine element too as is testified by Varro, supported by the find of the sanctuary of Hercules Curinus at Sulmona and by the existence of a Juno Curitis in Latium.&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''Lingua latina'' V 66 and 74; E. Paratore above p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayet above p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; is considered by scholars as having received its full acknowledgement and development in Etruria: Heracles has become a bearded adult on the mirrors of the 4th and 3rd centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;W. Deonna above; [[Larissa Bonfante]] "Etruscan Inscriptions and Etruscan Religion" in N. Thomas De Grummond (editor) ''The Religion of the Etruscans'' Univ. of Texas Press 2006 p. 15: "...the Etruscan version best illustrates the meaning of his name, glory of Hera".&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars view the fact as an initiation, i.e. the accession of Heracles to the condition of immortal. Even though the two versions coexisted in Greece and that of Heracles infant is attested earlier Renard suggests a process more in line with the evolution of the myth: the suckling of the adult Heracles should be regarded as more ancient and reflecting its original true meaning.&lt;ref&gt;M. Renard above p. 617-8: the process would be parallel to that of the myth of Eros, originally the primordial god who fathered Aphrodite who later became the child of the goddess.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juno and Genius===
The view that Juno was the feminine counterpart to [[Genius (mythology)|Genius]], i.e. that as men possess a tutelary entity or ''double'' named genius, so women have their own one named ''juno'', has been maintained by many scholars, lastly Kurt Latte.&lt;ref&gt;''Roscher Lexicon'' s. v. Iunones; W. Hastings, Sebin ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics'' Edinborough 1913 s. v. Family p. 797; K. Latte ''Römische Religionsgeschichte'' Munich 1960 p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; In the past it has also been argued that goddess Juno herself would be the issue of a process of abstraction from the individual ''junos'' of every woman.&lt;ref&gt;William Warde Fowler ''The Religious experience of the Roman People'' London 1918 p. 135-6&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Georg Wissowa]] and K. Latte, Genius (from the root ''gen-'', whence ''gigno'' bear or be born, archaic also ''geno'') would designate the specific virile generative potency, as opposed to feminine nature, reflected in conception and delivery, under the tutelage of Juno Lucina. Such an interpretation has been critically reviewed by [[Walter F. Otto]].&lt;ref&gt;''Pauly Real Encyclopaedie d. Altertumswissenchaften'' VII 1912 col. 1157-8; 1159-60: Otto underlines how this conception would entail the association of Genius with sex in common linguistic usage and how it would have been exploited in comic poets. Also that the Roman notion of genius was in the religious sphere close to the juridical concept of ''persona'', that the part of the human body associated to the Genius were not the sexual organs but the forehead (Servius ''Aen.''  III 607: "''frontem Genio, unde venerantes deum tangimus frontem''").&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are some correspondences between the ideas about genius and ''juno'', especially in the imperial age, the relevant documentation is rather late ([[Tibullus]] mentions it first).&lt;ref&gt;Tibullus III 19, 15 and 6, 48: IV 6, 1; CIL II 1324&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil also remarks that from these passages one could infer that every woman has a Venus too. As evidence of the antiquity of the concept of a ''juno'' of women, homologous to the ''genius'' of men, is the [[Arval Brethren|Arval]] sacrifice of two sheep to the Juno [[Dea Dia|Deae Diae]] ("the juno of goddesses named Dea Dia"), in contrast to their sacrifice of two cows sacrificed to Juno (singular). However both G. Wissowa and K. Latte allow that this ritual could have been adapted to fit theology of the Augustan restoration.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wissowa ''Religion und Kultus der Römer'' Munich 1912 p. 561 n. 7; K. Latte above p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; While the concept of a Juno of goddesses is not attested in the inscriptions of 58 BC from Furfo,&lt;ref&gt;CIL IX 3513: "''Genius Iovis Liberi''".&lt;/ref&gt; that of a Genius of gods is,&lt;ref&gt;CIL II 2407 "''Genius Iovis''", " ''Genius Martis''", "''Genius Victoriae''"&lt;/ref&gt; and even of a Genius of a goddess, [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]]. On this point it looks remarkable that also in [[Martianus Capella]]'s division of Heaven a ''Juno Hospitae Genius'' is mentioned in region IX, and not a ''Juno'': the sex of this Genius is feminine.&lt;ref&gt;The sex of the Genius (as well as of some other gods) may be uncertain as is shown in the case of the Genius of Rome: "Genio urbis Romae sive mas sive femina", inscription on the shield consecrated to him in the Capitol, quoted by Servius ''Ad Aen.'' II 351; cf. also CIL I 632: "sei deo sei deivae sac/ C Sextius C F Calvinus pr/ de senati sententia/ restituit"; Cato ''De Agricultura'' 139: "si deus si dea es quoium illud (lucus) sacrum est...".&lt;/ref&gt; See section below for details.

Romans believed the genius of somebody was an entity that embodied his essential character, personality, and also originally his vital, generative force and ''raison d' être''. However the genius had no direct relationship with sex, at least in the conceptions of the classical period, even though the nuptial bed was named ''lectus genialis'' in honour of the Genius and brides on the day of marriage invoked the genius of their grooms.&lt;ref&gt;Paulus ex Festo p. 214 L 2nd s. v. genialis lectus; Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' II 67.&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to hint to a significance of the ''Genius'' as the propagative spirit of the ''gens'', of whom every human individual is an incarnation:&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ''La religion romaine archaique'' part II chapt. 4, It. tr. p. 317 remarks ''primigenius'' does not mean the first among brothers, but the first absolute of all generations.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Censorinus]] states: "Genius is the god under whose tutelage everyone is born and lives on",&lt;ref&gt;Censorinus ''De Die Natali'' III 1&lt;/ref&gt; and that "many ancient authors, among whom [[Granius Flaccus]] in his ''De Indigitamentis'', maintain that he is one and the same with the [[Lares|Lar]]", meaning the Lar Familiaris. Festus calls him "a god endowed with the power of doing everything", then citing an Aufustius: "Genius is the son of the gods and the parent of men, from whom men receive life. Thence is he named my genius, because he begot me". Festus's quotation goes on saying: "Other think he is the special god of every place", a notion that reflects a different idea.&lt;ref&gt;Festus p. 214 L 2nd s. v. genius.&lt;/ref&gt; In classic age literature and iconography he is often represented as a snake, that may appear in the conjugal bed, this conception being perhaps the result of a Greek influence. It was easy for the Roman concept of Genius to expand annexing other similar religious figures as the Lares and the Greek [[agathodaemon|δαίμων ἀγαθός]].&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''De Divinatione'' I 36; Julius Obsequens 58; Vergil ''Aen.'' V 94-6; Aulus Gellius VI 1, 3, where however he is rather Jupiter himself.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ''La religion romaine archaïque'' Paris 1977 part II chapt. 4; It. tr. Milano 1977 p. 316-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The genius was believed to be associated with the forehead of each man, while goddess Juno, not the ''juno'' of every woman, was supposed to have under her jurisdiction the eyebrows of women&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''Lingua Latina'' V 69.&lt;/ref&gt; or to be the tutelary goddess of the eyebrows of everybody, irrespective of one's sex.&lt;ref&gt;Paulus ex Festo p. 403 L 2nd.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil above: It. tr. p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juno and the Penates===
According to one interpretation of the [[Di Penates]], Juno, along with Jupiter and Minerva, is one of the Penates of man.&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' III 40; Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 13.&lt;/ref&gt; This view is ascribed by Macrobius to the mystic religion of Samothrace, imported to Rome by Tarquinius Priscus, himself an initiate, who thereby created the Roman Capitoline Triad. Juno is the god by whom man gets his body.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius III 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heries Junonis===
Among the female entities that in the pontifical invocations accompanied the naming of gods, Juno was associated to Heries, which she shared with [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] (''Heres Martea'').&lt;ref&gt;Gellius XIII 23, 2 and 18; Festus p. 221 L; Ennius ''Annales'' 104 "''...Nerienem Mavortis et Herem...''" .&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
{{Main|Matronalia}}
[[File:S03 06 01 020 image 2539.jpg|thumbnail|left|Juno; Vatican, Rome. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]
All festivals of Juno were held on the kalendae of a month except two (or, perhaps, three): the ''Nonae Caprotinae'' on the [[Caprotinia|nonae]] of July, the festival of ''Juno Capitolina'' on September 13, because the date of these two was determined by the preeminence of Jupiter. Perhaps a second festival of ''Juno Moneta'' was held on October 10, possibly the date of the dedication of her temple. This fact reflects the strict association of the goddess with the beginning of each lunar month.

Every year, on the first of March, women held a festival in honour of Juno Lucina called the [[Matronalia]]. [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]] was an epithet for Juno as "she who brings children into light." On this day, lambs and cattle were sacrificed in her honor in the temple of her sacred grove on the [[Cispius]].

The second festival was devoted to ''Juno Moneta'' on June 1.

After this was the festival of the ''Nonae Caprotinae'' ("The Nones of the Wild Fig") held on July 7.

The festival of ''Juno Regina'' fell on September 1, followed on the 13th of the same month by that of ''Juno Regina Capitolina''.

October 1 was the date of the ''Tigillum Sororium'' in which the goddess was honoured as ''Juno Sororia''.

The last of her yearly festivals was that of ''Juno Sospita'' on February 1. It was an appropriate date for her celebration since the month of February was considered a perilous time of passage, the cosmic year then coming to an end and the limits between the world of the living and the underworld being no longer safely defined. Hence the community invoked the protection (''tutela'') of the warlike ''Juno Sospita'', "''The Saviour''".

Juno is the patroness of marriage, and many people believe that the most favorable time to marry is June, the month named after the goddess.

==Etrurian Uni, Hera, Astarte and Juno==
The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] were a people who maintained extensive (if often conflicting) contacts with the other peoples of the Mediterranean: the Greeks, the Phoenicians, and the Carthaginians.

Evidence of intense cultural exchanges with the Greeks has been found in 1969 at the sanctuary of the port of Gravisca near [[Tarquinia]].&lt;ref&gt;Dedicatory inscriptions to Hera on terracottas of the 6th century; besides Greek dedications to Hera, Aphrodite and Apollo, Etruscan to Turan. M. Torelli "Il santuario greco di Gradisca" ''La Parola del Passato'' '''32''' 1977 p. 398-458. All the Greek Inscriptions are written in Ionian characters, Torelli thinks of a Samian colony. The cult of the lunar deities may be associated with sailing: cf. Roscher ''Studien zur vergleichenden Myth der Griechen und Römer. II Iuno und Hera'' Leipzig 1875 p. 106ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Renard thinks the cult of Hera in great emporia such as [[Crotone|Croton]], Posidonia, Pyrgi might be a counter to Aphrodite's, linked to sacred prostitution in ports, as the sovereign of legitimate marriage and family and of their sacrality. Hera's presence had already been attested at [[Caere]] in the sanctuary of Manganello.&lt;ref&gt;Dedications on terracottas of the 4th-3rd century.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century a dedication to Iuno Historia was discovered at Castrum Novum (Santa Marinella).&lt;ref&gt;CIL 3573. Renard associates it to the Greek legend of [[Galanthis|Historis]] daughter of [[Tiresias]] and sister of [[Manto (mythology)|Manto]] who by cheating Hera allowed [[Alcmene|Alcmena]]'s delivery of Heracles. Fecundity, birth, prophecy, magic and lunar character are common to the two figures: M. Renard "Iuno Historia" in ''Latomus'' '''12''' 1953 p. 137-54; Pausanias IX 11, 3. On the oracular Hera of [[Cuma (Italy)|Cuma]] cf. M. Guarducci ''Un antchissimo responso dell' oracolo di Cuma'' p. 129 ff., also on Iuno Moneta.&lt;/ref&gt; The cult of Iuno and Hera is generally attested in Etruria.&lt;ref&gt;At Perusia, Cortona, Siena, Populonia, Visentium, even more in southern Etruria at Veii, Falerii, Tarquinia, Gravisca, Caerae, Pyrgi: M. Renard "Iuno Historia" above p. 152; L. Ross Taylor ''Local Cults in Etruria''  p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between Uni and the Phoenician goddess [[Astarte]] has been brought to light by the discovery of the [[Pyrgi Tablets]] in 1964. At [[Pyrgi]], one of the ports of Caere, excavations had since 1956 revealed the existence of a sacred area, intensely active from the last quarter of the 4th century, yielding two documents of a cult of [[Uni (mythology)|Uni]]. Scholars had long believed the Etruscan goddess Uni was strongly influenced by the Argive Heras and had her Punic counterpart in the Carthaginian goddess [[Tanit]], identified by the Romans as Juno Caelestis.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Martianus Capella: Saturni Caelestis Iuno, in region XIV of Heaven.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless [[Augustine of Hippo]] had already stated that Juno was named Astarte in the Punic language,&lt;ref&gt;Augustinus ''Quaestiones in Heptateuchum'' VII 16&lt;/ref&gt; a notion that the discovery of the Pyrgi lamellae has proved correct. It is debated whether such an identification was linked to a transient political stage corresponding with Tefarie Velianas's Carthaginian-backed tyranny on Caere as the sanctuary does not show any other trait proper to Phoenician ones.&lt;ref&gt;The presence of Astarte would be the reflection of a familiarity of the Etruscans with Phoenician_Punic religion as a consequence of their alliance with the Carthaginians at [[Battle of Alalia|Alalia]] and at the time of the first treaty between Rome and Carthage (Polybius II 22, 19). It would testify to the adaptability of Etruscan theology, ready to assimilate myths and rites. G. Dumézil ARR p. 663. M. Pallottino remarked the golden lamellae look to have been written hastily.&lt;/ref&gt; The mention of the goddess of the sanctuary as being named locally Eileitheia and Leucothea by different Greek authors narrating its destruction by the Syracusean fleet in 384 BC, made the picture even more complex.&lt;ref&gt;Strabon V 2, 8; Ps. Aristoteles ''Oekonomica'' II 2, 10; Polyanus II 21; Aelianus ''Historia Varia'' I 20. G. Dumézil ''Myth et Epopée. III'' p. 166ff.; R. Bloch ''Recherches sur les religions de l'Italie antique'' Genève 1976 p. 1-9&lt;/ref&gt; R. Bloch has proposed a two-stage interpretation: the first theonym Eilethya corresponds to Juno Lucina, the second Leucothea to Mater Matuta. However, the local theonym is Uni and one would legitimately expect it to be translated as Hera. A fragmentary bronze lamella discovered on the same site and mentioning both theonym Uni and Thesan (i. e. Latin Juno and Aurora-Mater Matuta) would then allow the inference of the integration of the two deities at Pyrgi: the local Uni-Thesan matronal and auroral, would have become the Iuno Lucina and the Mater Matuta of Rome. The Greek assimilation would reflect this process as not direct but subsequent to a process of distinction. Renard rejects this hypothesis since he sees in Uni and Thesan two distinct deities, though associated in cult.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil above p. 171 : "It is not certain whether Thesan be a designation of Uni".&lt;/ref&gt; However the entire picture should have been familiar in Italian and Roman religious lore as is shown by the complexity and ambivalence of the relationship of Juno with Rome and Romans in Virgil's Aeneid, who has Latin, Greek and Punic traits, result of a plurisaecular process of amalgamation.&lt;ref&gt;P. Boyancé "La religion de Virgil" ''Collection Myth et Religion'' 1963 p. 19; R. Bloch ''A propos de l'Eneide de Virgile'' p. 334-7 above; W. S. Anderson "Iuno and Saturn in the Aeneid" ''Studies in Philology'' 55 '''4''' p. 61-9; L. A. Mac Kay ''Saturnia Iuno in Greece and Rome'' 2nd Series '''3''' 1956 p. 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Also remarkable in this sense is the ''Fanum Iunonis'' of Malta (of the Hellenistic period) which has yielded dedicatory inscriptions to Astarte and Tanit.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bloch "Hera, Uni, Junon en Italie Centrale" p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juno in Martianus Capella's division of Heaven===
Martianus Capella's collocation of gods into sixteen different regions of Heaven&lt;ref&gt;Martianus Capella ''De Nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae'' I 45-60.&lt;/ref&gt; is supposed to be based on and to reflect Etruscan religious lore, at least in part. It is thence comparable with the theonyms found in the sixteen cases of the outer rim of the [[Piacenza Liver]].&lt;ref&gt;The division of Heaven into sixteen parts is ascribed to the [[Etrusca disciplina]], the art of interpreting the meaning of lightningbolts: Pliny ''Naturalis Hiatoria'' II 143; Cicero ''De Dininatione'' II 42. It implied a twice repeated division of the four parts of the sky based on the four cardinal points into two sections. A north south line divides space into a left part to the east, named familiaris and considered favourable (the orientation is defined by an observer facing south), and a right part to the west, named hostilis, unfavourable. An east-west line divides space into a ''pars postica''  and ''antica'', i.e. beneath and above the line of the horizon. The world man can see is to the south of the east-west line. The sections of the NE quadrant are inhabited by the heavenly gods, thence are the most favourable. Those of the NW quadrant by the underworld and fate gods, thence the most unfavourable. The sections of the SE quadrant are inhabited by gods of nature, thence moderately favourable. Those of the SW quadrant byearthly gods and gods related to humans, thence moderately unfavourable. M. Pallottino "Deorun sedes" in ''Studi in onore di Aristide Calderini e Roberto Paribeni'' Milano 1956 '''3''' p. 223-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Juno is to be found in region II, along with Quirinus Mars, Lars militaris, Fons, Lymphae and the dii Novensiles. This position is reflected on the [[Piacenza Liver]] by the situation of Uni in case IV, owing to a threefold location of [[Tinia]] in the first three cases that determines an equivalent shift.

An entity named Juno Hospitae Genius is to be found alone in region IX. Since [[Grotius]] (1599) many editors have proposed the correction of Hospitae into Sospitae. S. Weinstock has proposed to identify this entity with one of the spouses of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], as the epithet recurs below (I 81) used in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;S. Weinstock "Martianus Capella and the Cosmic System of the Etruscans" in ''Journal of Roman Studies''  '''36''' 1946 p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

In region XIV is located Juno Caelestis along with [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]. This deity is the Punic Astarte/Tanit, usually associated with Saturn in Africa. Iuno Caelestis is thence in turn assimilated to [[Ops]] and Greek [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]].&lt;ref&gt;Varro ''Antiquitates Rerum Divinarum'' 1, fr. 23 Cardauns apud Tertullian ''Ad Nationes'' II 2, 15: fr. 36 C apud Augustin ''de Civitate Dei'' IV 23; 16 fr. 240 C apud Tertullian above II 12, 18; Macrobius  ''Saturnalia'' I 10, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Uni is here the Punic goddess, in accord with the identification of Pyrgi. Her paredra was the Phoenician god [[Ba'al]], interpreted as Saturn. Capdeville admits of being unable to explain the collocation of Juno Caelestis among the underworld gods, which looks to be determined mainly by her condition as spouse of Saturn.&lt;ref&gt;M. Leglay ''Saturne Africain. Histoire'' Paris 1966 p. 215-222.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Capdeville "Les dieux de Martianus Capella" in ''Revue de l' Histoire des Religions'' '''213''' 3 1996 p. 250-300, especially p. 290-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statue at Samos ==
[[File:Illustration from Views in the Ottoman Dominions by Luigi Mayer, digitally enhanced by rawpixel-com 59.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the temple of Juno in Samos, painted by [[Luigi Mayer]]]]
In the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] city of [[Maastricht]], which was founded as ''Trajectum ad Mosam'' in the Roman province of [[Germania Inferior]] about 2000 years ago, the remains of the foundations of a substantial temple for Juno and Jupiter are to be found in the cellars of Hotel Derlon. Over part of the Roman remains the first Christian church of the [[Netherlands in the Roman era|Netherlands]] was built in the 4th century AD.

The story behind these remains begins with Juno and Jupiter being born as twins of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] and [[Ops|Opis]]. Juno was sent to [[Samos]] when she was a very young child. She was carefully raised there until [[puberty]], when she then married her brother. A statue was made representing Juno, the bride, as a young girl on her wedding day. It was carved out of [[Parian marble]] and placed in front of her temple at Samos for many centuries. Ultimately this statue of Juno was brought to Rome and placed in the sanctuary of [[Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]]. For a long time the Romans honored her with many ceremonies under the name Queen Juno. The remains were moved then sometime between the 1st century and the 4th century to the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Brown's translation of Giovanni Boccaccio's ''Famous Women'', pp. 13–14; Harvard University Press 2001; {{ISBN|0-674-01130-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature ==
Perhaps Juno's most prominent appearance in [[Latin literature|Roman literature]] is as the primary antagonistic force in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', where she is depicted as a cruel and savage goddess intent upon supporting first [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] and then [[Turnus]] and the [[Rutuli]]ans against [[Aeneas]]' attempt to found a new [[Troy]] in Italy.&lt;ref name="University of Mary Washington"&gt;{{cite web|title=Deception in the Aeneid|url=http://warintheaeneid.umwblogs.org/2008/06/13/deception-in-the-aeneid/|website=[[University of Mary Washington]]|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]], commenting on some of her several roles in the ''Aeneid'', supposes her as a conflation of [[Hera]] with the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] storm-goddess [[Tanit]]. [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' offers a story accounting for her sacred association with the [[peacock]].&lt;ref&gt;classics.mit.edu/Ovid/metam.html contains a full text translation of the work.&lt;/ref&gt; She is remembered in ''[[De Mulieribus Claris]]'', a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the [[Florence|Florentine]] author [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], composed in 1361{{endash}}62. It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature.&lt;ref name="Brown_xi"&gt;{{harvp|Boccaccio|2003|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[William Shakespeare]] briefly employs Juno as a [[masque]] character in ''[[The Tempest]]'' (Act IV, Scene I).
