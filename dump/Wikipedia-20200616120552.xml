"'''My Love'''" is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter [[Justin Timberlake]] for his second studio album, ''[[FutureSex/LoveSounds]]'' (2006). It was released on October 24, 2006, by [[Jive Records]] as the second single from the album. The song features American rapper [[T.I.]] and was co-written by Timberlake, [[Timbaland]], [[Danja (musician)|Nate "Danja" Hills]], and [[T.I.]], and produced by Timberlake, Timbaland, and Danja.

Timberlake revealed that the song's creating process took time to imagine and execute.&lt;ref name="rolling" /&gt; He also stated that "My Love" was less about marriage and a more humble approach to love. The song features synthesizer chords with a slow beat and includes a [[beatboxing]], [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], and [[staccato]] sounds. Timberlake described the track as "a rock-techno ballad".&lt;ref name="rolling" /&gt;

The track reached number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], being Timberlake's second consecutive single to do so. Among other ''Billboard'' magazine's charts, it also topped the [[Mainstream Top 40]], [[Hot Dance Airplay]], and [[Hot Digital Songs]] charts. Internationally, the single peaked in the number two position on the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming Timberlake's fourth single to do so. In New Zealand, the track peaked at number one for five non-consecutive weeks, to become Timberlake's second number one single.

[[Pitchfork Media]] named "My Love" as their number one song of 2006. Many have cited that the song was a sequel to Timberlake's 2002 song "[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]".&lt;ref name="obsevermail" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ny mag" /&gt; The track won [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration|Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] at the [[49th Grammy Awards|2007 Grammy Awards]]. "My Love" also won Timberlake the Male Artist of the Year and Best Choreography in a Video at the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards]].

==Background==
In December 2005, Timberlake began working on his second album, ''[[FutureSex/LoveSounds]]'', the follow-up to ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]'' (2002). Within three weeks, "My Love" was one of several songs that were recorded.&lt;ref name="rolling"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11514699/cover_story_justin_timberlake_revs_up_his_sex_machine/5|title=Justin Timberlake Revs Up His Sex Machine|last=Scaggs|first=Austin|date=2006-09-06|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|page=5|accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, Timberlake told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that the song was "a hip-hop ballad" and that the process of creating "took two hours to imagine and execute".&lt;ref name="rolling" /&gt; While promoting the album in an interview with [[MTV News]], Timberlake revealed that the second half of the album (including "My Love") focuses on anthems of love.&lt;ref name="jv" /&gt; In another interview, he revealed that "My Love" was a "contradiction of sounds. You've got this operatic thing going on. If you take all the [[staccato]] sounds out, the essence of the song is it's a ballad, but the way the beat is inlaid underneath the vocals, it becomes a percussive ballad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jon|last=Breamu|title=Justin time&amp;nbsp;— Timberlake gets in sync with his sexy side on new beat-driven CD|date=2006-09-21|work=Ventura County Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussion of [[T.I.]]'s participation in the track, Timberlake said: "The second hook finished and I said, 'Oh, a rapper would sound good on this'."&lt;ref name="norris"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/the_leak/justin_timberlake/futuresexlovesounds/index.jhtml|title=Justin Timberlake Launches New Album|last=Ganz|first=Caryn|author2=John Norris|date=2006-09-12|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=2009-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timbaland, who co-wrote and produced the song, agreed to the idea and suggested T.I. Timberlake agreed to the idea, although he doubted that T.I. would say yes,&lt;ref name="norris" /&gt; and said that he was thankful that T.I. agreed to take part.&lt;ref name="norris" /&gt;

Timberlake revealed in 2013 that he originally asked rapper [[Jay Z|JAY-Z]] (Whom he would collaborate with extensively in his later career) to appear on the track before T.I. "I wanted to do a record with him on ''FutureSex/LoveSounds'' ..." he explained "...and he at that time had done a record with [[Beyoncé]], it was '[[Déjà Vu (Beyoncé song)|Déjà Vu]].' And he said—respectfully, I can't knock him for saying like I have this one feature, I think he was working on his own music as well so he didn't want to be on too many things. And I said, 'I totally respect that. I'm obviously not gonna get into any domestic anything. That's your wife.' But the record was 'My Love.' And it ended up being an interesting blessing in disguise because I thank Tip for that record—I mean his verse is phenomenal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.25244/title.justin-timberlake-says-jay-z-was-approached-before-t-i-for-my-love-collaboration|title=Justin Timberlake Says Jay Z Was Approached Before T.I.

In July 2006, ''[[The Observer|The Observer Music Monthly]]'' interviewed Timberlake and stated that the track "is arguably the album's 'Cry Me a River'."&lt;ref name="obsevermail" /&gt; In response, Timberlake said, "It is similar. You go back to [[Aaliyah]]'s biggest record, '[[Are You That Somebody?|Are You That Somebody]]' – it's similar to that too because it's that percussive ballad."&lt;ref name="obsevermail" /&gt; When asked about the lyrics, "There's just one thing I need from you: say I do", being [[Justin Timberlake#Personal life|autobiographical]], he said no, adding that the line before that, "this ring here represents my heart", is about marriage and love. Timberlake stated, "It's not specifically about marriage, but about a humble approach to love. None of it is autobiographical, though obviously I have experience to draw from."&lt;ref name="obsevermail" /&gt;

Williams stated that the song is "an obvious sequel" to Timberlake's 2002 song "[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]".&lt;ref name="ny mag" /&gt; ''[[The Georgia Straight]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Martin Turenne interprets the song's background as Timberlake lowering himself on bended knee, proposing long walks on the beach and asking, "Would you date me on the regular?".&lt;ref name="straight"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/timberlake-strangely-ladylike?# |title=Timberlake strangely ladylike |last=Turenne |first=Martin |date=2006-09-14 |work=[[The Georgia Straight]] |accessdate=2009-05-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016050549/http://www.straight.com/timberlake-strangely-ladylike |archivedate=2012-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dagny Salas of ''[[North by Northwestern]]'' considered it a more romantic song, about Timberlake professing his love to a woman.&lt;ref name="north"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/2006/10/340/album-review-of-justin-timberlakes-futuresexlovesounds/|title=Album Review of Justin Timberlake's FutureSex/LoveSounds|last=Salas|first=Dagny|author2=Emily Vaughan|date=2006-10-09|work=[[North by Northwestern]]|accessdate=2009-05-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105231850/http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/2006/10/340/album-review-of-justin-timberlakes-futuresexlovesounds/|archive-date=2007-11-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have opined that "My Love" is a marriage proposal.&lt;ref name="justice"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.www.thejusticeonline.com/media/storage/paper573/news/2006/09/12/Arts/On.The.Record.Justin.Timberlake.John.Mayer.The.Rapture-2267374.shtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20110728100216/http://media.www.thejusticeonline.com/media/storage/paper573/news/2006/09/12/Arts/On.The.Record.Justin.Timberlake.John.Mayer.The.Rapture-2267374.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-07-28|title=On the Record: Justin Timberlake, John Mayer, The Rapture|last=Fischer|first=Jonathan|date=2006-09-12|work=[[Brandeis University|The Justice]]|page=1|accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
{{Quote box|width=300px|align=right|quote="A sort of hip-hop ballad with the inclusion of T.I.'s verse, this song crosses more than a few genre boundaries and was well-received.

In ''[[The New York Times]]'' review of the album, critic [[Kelefa Sanneh]] wrote: "...'My Love', a sumptuous collaboration with the rapper T.I. It starts with a 90-second 'prelude', a clattering rhythm track with a bit of rapping and snippets of melody. Then the real thing hits: sleek synthesizer chords punctuated by tiny bursts of silence."&lt;ref name="ny times"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/11/arts/music/11choi.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;ref=music&amp;pagewanted=all|title=New CD's|date=2006-09-11|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sal Cinquemani of [[Slant Magazine]] wrote that the track "mixes Timberlake's proud beatboxing talent with colossal, futuristic synth swirls and a cartoonish, maniacal giggle that's looped ad infinitum a la the crying baby from [[Aaliyah]]'s '[[Are You That Somebody]]?'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=957|title=Justin Timberlake&amp;nbsp;— FutureSex/LoveSounds|last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|date=2006-09-05|work=[[Slant (magazine)|Slant]]|accessdate=2009-05-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627112818/http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=957|archivedate=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Gasteier of ''Prefix'' magazine noted that the song "is probably the standout triumph here, with stuttering synths and a fade-in-fade-out shimmering beat that may be the best ever from Timbaland".&lt;ref name="prefix"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/justin-timberlake/futuresexlovesounds/15422/|title=Justin Timberlake&amp;nbsp;— FutureSex/LoveSounds|last=Gasteier|first=Matthew|date=2006-09-12|work=Prefix|accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lauren Murphy of [[entertainment.ie]] stated that the single is "undeniably fluid and features some of the niftiest slo-mo effects around".&lt;ref name="murphy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.ie/album-review/Justin-Timberlake---FutureSex/LoveSounds/4678.htm|title=Justin Timberlake&amp;nbsp;— FutureSex/LoveSounds|last=Murphy|first=Lauren|date=2006-09-19|publisher=[[entertainment.ie]]|accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonah Weiner of ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' magazine cited the song as the "standout" song from the album and wrote that the single "...straddles the album's up-tempo ''FutureSex'' and balladeering ''LoveSounds'' halves — one coos about puppy love over the other's stroboscopic, salivating beat, and both trade devotionals on the chorus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/new/54309/futuresexlovesounds.html|title=FutureSex/LoveSounds|last=Weiner|first=John|date=2006-09-12|work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]|accessdate=2009-05-18}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"My Love" was criticized for some of the lyrics and sounds that were featured. Sanneh reported that Timberlake "exhales his clumsy pickup lines" with the lyrics "If I told you you were beautiful / Would you date me on the regular?".&lt;ref name="ny times" /&gt; Murphy contemplated that the song is "ultimately ruined" by a "bizarre [[Crazy Frog]]-meets-Laughing-Policeman underlay".&lt;ref name="murphy" /&gt; Emily Vaughan of ''North by Northwestern'' commented that Timberlake claims to have gone around the world twice in "My Love" and "Damn Girl" and that he is also "running out of creative ways to say he would like you to go to bed with him".&lt;ref name="north"/&gt; Vaughan, however, was positive towards "My Love", stating that the song, along with "[[What Goes Around ... / ... Comes Around]]", sounded considerably different from the rest of the album.&lt;ref name="north"/&gt;

[[VH1]]'s Emily Exton in a 2013 article said that in the song Timberlake "reinvents mainstream pop music and increases his artistic credibility at the same time. The song is more sonically futuristic than others."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.vh1.com/news/51659/justin-timberlake-greatest-songs/ |title=Let The Groove Get In: Justin Timberlake's 20 Greatest Songs |date=October 4, 2013 |work=VH1 |access-date=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article about Timberlake's catalogue in 2016, [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] staff stated the song "is one of the foundational texts of the [[Alternative R&amp;B|PBR&amp;B]] explosion of the 2010s," also noting the track's cyborg theremin wails, slo-mo rave synths and a frail falsetto "it's the midpoint between the space futurism of [[Aaliyah]] and [[Ginuwine]]'s hits, and the robo-blues that would emerge with ''[[808s &amp; Heartbreak]]''."

[[Image:Justin-timberlake-my-love.jpg|thumb|left|Timberlake with a female dancer in the music video.]]
The video starts with "Let Me Talk to You" as the background is surrounded by faulty fluorescent lighting, turning on and off in a programmed pattern. It also begins with Timberlake and Timbaland chanting "hey" to one another. The video proceeds with Timberlake dancing to the beat of the song. Timbaland then begins singing the first verse of the song, which then is proceeded by Timberlake. This is immediately followed with "My Love" playing; the first verse of the song, "Ain't another woman that could take your spot my", plays. Timberlake comes floating toward the camera, down the faulty fluorescent tube. Once Timberlake stops floating, he begins singing the main verse of the song, which violins begin to float swirling gently around him, for "If I wrote you a symphony / Just to say how much you mean to me". The scene then changes with Timberlake and various dancers dancing accordingly in a choreographed style. When Timberlake begins the second verse, "Now if I wrote you a love note / And made you smile at every word I wrote", pens and paper begin to float. This later exceeds with Timberlake singing "This ring here represents my heart" with a ring swirling into the camera. T.I. is then seen in the shot. T.I. begins [[rapping]] his lines in the song. After T.I. finishes his verse, Timberlake is then seen dancing with a female back-up dancer. Though, as they continue dancing, the female then leaves the shot, leaving Timberlake to dance to the end of the song. In the closing moments, the camera swirls around him, proving, conclusively, from every angle, that everyone has gone.

At the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards]], Timberlake won Male Artist of the Year for "Let Me Talk To You/ My Love", "SexyBack", and "What Goes Around ... / ... Comes Around".&lt;ref name="vma"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1566507/20070807/timberlake_justin.jhtml|title=MTV VMA Race Is On: Justin Timberlake, Beyonce Lead Nominations|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=2007-08-07|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He, alongside choreographers Blake Anthony and Marty Kudelka, won Best Choreography in a Video for "My Love".&lt;ref name="vma" /&gt;
