{{Sustainable energy}}
'''Solar power''' is the [[energy transformation|conversion of energy]] from [[sunlight]] into [[electricity]], either directly using [[photovoltaics]] (PV), indirectly using [[concentrated solar power]], or a combination. Concentrated solar power systems use [[lens (optics)|lenses]] or [[mirrors]] and [[solar tracking]] systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. [[Photovoltaic cells]] convert light into an [[electric current]] using the [[photovoltaic effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Sources: Solar|url=https://www.energy.gov/energysources/solar.htm|work=Department of Energy|access-date=19 April 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414081047/http://www.energy.gov/energysources/solar.htm|archive-date=14 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photovoltaics were initially solely used as a source of [[electricity]] for small and medium-sized applications, from the [[calculator]] powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an [[off-grid]] rooftop PV system. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. As the cost of solar electricity has fallen, the number of grid-connected [[solar PV systems]] has [[Growth of photovoltaics|grown into the millions]] and utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station]]s with hundreds of megawatts are being built. Solar PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive, low-carbon technology to harness [[renewable energy]] from the Sun. The current largest photovoltaic power station in the world is the [[Pavagada Solar Park]], Karnataka, [[India]] with a generation capacity of 2050 MW.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mercomindia.com/karnatakas-pavagada-solar-operational/|title=World's Largest Solar Park at Karnataka's Pavagada is Now Fully Operational|last=Ranjan|first=Rakesh|date=2019-12-27|website=Mercom India|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Energy Agency]] projected in 2014 that under its "high renewables" scenario, by 2050, solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power would contribute about 16 and 11 percent, respectively, of the [[worldwide electricity consumption]], and solar would be the world's largest source of electricity. Most solar installations would be in [[Solar power in China|China]] and [[Solar power in India|India]].&lt;ref name=IEA-roadmap-PV-2014 /&gt; In 2017, solar power provided 1.7% of total worldwide electricity production, growing 35% from the previous year.&lt;ref name=bp2018&gt;[https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/renewable-energy/solar-energy.html BP Global: Solar energy]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, the unsubsidised [[levelised cost of electricity]] for utility-scale solar power is around $43/MWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-and-levelized-cost-of-storage-2018/ |title = Levelized Cost of Energy and Levelized Cost of Storage 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mainstream technologies ==

Many industrialized nations have installed significant solar power capacity into their grids to supplement or provide an alternative to [[conventional energy]] sources while an increasing number of less developed nations have turned to solar to reduce dependence on expensive imported fuels ''(see [[solar power by country]])''. Long distance transmission allows remote [[renewable energy]] resources to displace fossil fuel consumption. Solar power plants use one of two technologies:
* [[Photovoltaic]] (PV) [[Photovoltaic systems|systems]] use [[solar panel]]s, either on [[Rooftop photovoltaic power station|rooftops]] or in ground-mounted [[solar farm]]s, converting sunlight directly into electric power. 
* [[Concentrated solar power]] (CSP, also known as "concentrated solar thermal") plants use [[solar thermal energy]] to make steam, that is thereafter converted into electricity by a turbine.

=== Photovoltaic cells ===
{{Main|Photovoltaics|Solar cell}}
[[File:PV-system-schematics-residential-Eng.png|thumb|upright=1.1|right|Schematics of a grid-connected residential [[PV power system]]&lt;ref name="SolarCells_Section10_2"&gt;Solar Cells and their Applications Second Edition, Lewis Fraas, Larry Partain, Wiley, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-470-44633-1}}, Section10.2.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A [[solar cell]], or photovoltaic cell (PV), is a device that converts light into electric current using the [[photovoltaic effect]]. The first solar cell was constructed by [[Charles Fritts]] in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Perlin (1999), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; The German industrialist [[Ernst Werner von Siemens]] was among those who recognized the importance of this discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Perlin (1999), pp. 18–20&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, the German engineer Bruno Lange developed a photo cell using [[silver selenide]] in place of [[copper oxide]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9CcDAAAAMBAJ |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9CcDAAAAMBAJ/page/n42 41] |title=Magic Plates, Tap Sun For Power|journal=Popular Science |date = June 1931|accessdate=19 April 2011|last1=Corporation|first1=Bonnier}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the prototype [[selenium]] cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity. Following the work of [[Russell Ohl]] in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, [[Calvin Fuller]] and Daryl Chapin created the [[silicon]] solar cell in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Perlin (1999), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; These early solar cells cost US$286/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%.&lt;ref&gt;Perlin (1999), p. 29–30, 38&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, [[Mohamed M. Atalla]] developed the process of silicon [[surface passivation]] by [[thermal oxidation]] at [[Bell Labs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Black |first1=Lachlan E. |title=New Perspectives on Surface Passivation: Understanding the Si-Al2O3 Interface |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783319325217 |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/156698511.pdf |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lojek"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lojek |first1=Bo |title=History of Semiconductor Engineering |url=https://archive.org/details/historysemicondu00loje_697 |url-access=limited |date=2007 |publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |isbn=9783540342588 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historysemicondu00loje_697/page/n128 120]&amp; 321–323}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surface passivation process has since been critical to [[solar cell efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Black |first1=Lachlan E. |title=New Perspectives on Surface Passivation: Understanding the Si-Al2O3 Interface |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783319325217 |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/156698511.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The array of a [[photovoltaic power system]], or PV system, produces [[direct current]] (DC) power which fluctuates with the sunlight's intensity. 
For practical use this usually requires conversion to certain desired voltages or alternating current (AC), through the use of [[Solar inverter|inverters]].&lt;ref name="SolarCells_Section10_2" /&gt; 
Multiple solar cells are connected inside modules. 
Modules are wired together to form arrays, then tied to an inverter, which produces power at the desired voltage, and for AC, the desired frequency/phase.&lt;ref name="SolarCells_Section10_2" /&gt;

Many residential PV systems are connected to the grid wherever available, especially in developed countries with large markets.&lt;ref name="IEAPVPS2009_Fig3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/index.php?id=92&amp;eID=dam_frontend_push&amp;docID=432 | title=Trends in Photovoltaic Applications Survey report of selected IEA countries between 1992 and 2009, IEA-PVPS | access-date=8 November 2011 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525165534/http://www.iea-pvps.org/index.php?id=92&amp;eID=dam_frontend_push&amp;docID=432 | archive-date=25 May 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In these [[Grid-connected photovoltaic power system|grid-connected PV systems]], use of energy storage is optional. 
In certain applications such as satellites, lighthouses, or in developing countries, batteries or additional power generators are often added as back-ups. Such [[stand-alone power system]]s permit operations at night and at other times of limited sunlight.

=== Concentrated solar power ===
{{Main|Concentrated solar power}}
[[File:Parabolic trough.svg|thumb|upright=0.75|A [[parabolic trough|parabolic collector]] concentrates sunlight onto a tube in its focal point.]]

[[Concentrated solar power]] (CSP), also called "concentrated solar thermal", uses lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to concentrate sunlight, then use the resulting heat to generate electricity from conventional steam-driven turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.solarpaces.org/how-csp-works/|title=How CSP Works: Tower, Trough, Fresnel or Dish|last=Author|date=2018-06-11|website=Solarpaces|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide range of concentrating technologies exists: among the best known are the [[parabolic trough]], the [[compact linear Fresnel reflector]], the [[dish Stirling]] and the [[solar power tower]]. Various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light. In all of these systems a [[working fluid]] is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage.&lt;ref name="Martin 2005"&gt;Martin and Goswami (2005), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Thermal storage efficiently allows up to 24-hour electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/07/solar-can-be-baseload-spanish-csp-plant-with-storage-produces-electricity-for-24-hours-straight|title=Spanish CSP Plant with Storage Produces Electricity for 24 Hours Straight|author=Stephen Lacey|date=6 July 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012112224/http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/07/solar-can-be-baseload-spanish-csp-plant-with-storage-produces-electricity-for-24-hours-straight|archive-date=12 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''parabolic trough'' consists of a linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's focal line. The receiver is a tube positioned along the focal points of the linear parabolic mirror and is filled with a working fluid. The reflector is made to follow the sun during daylight hours by tracking along a single axis. Parabolic trough systems provide the best land-use factor of any solar technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/Concentrated-Solar-Thermal-Power.pdf | title=Concentrated Solar Thermal Power – Now | access-date=19 August 2008 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910052050/http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/Concentrated-Solar-Thermal-Power.pdf | archive-date=10 September 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Solar Energy Generating Systems]] plants in California and Acciona's [[Nevada Solar One]] near [[Boulder City, Nevada]] are representatives of this technology.&lt;ref name="SolarPaces 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = UNLV Solar Site |publisher = University of Las Vegas |url = http://www.solar.unlv.edu/projects/eldorado.php |access-date = 2 July 2008 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://archive.today/20060903112910/http://www.solar.unlv.edu/projects/eldorado.php |archive-date = 3 September 2006 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors'' are CSP-plants which use many thin mirror strips instead of parabolic mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This has the advantage that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors can be placed in the same amount of space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/app/research/solar/clfr.html |title = Compact CLFR |publisher = Physics.usyd.edu.au |date = 12 June 2002 |access-date = 19 April 2011 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110412235037/http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/app/research/solar/clfr.html |archive-date = 12 April 2011 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ese.iitb.ac.in/activities/solarpower/ausra.pdf |title=Ausra compact CLFR introducing cost-saving solar rotation features |access-date=19 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721150750/http://www.ese.iitb.ac.in/activities/solarpower/ausra.pdf |archive-date=21 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Stirling solar dish'' combines a parabolic concentrating dish with a [[Stirling engine]] which normally drives an electric generator. The advantages of Stirling solar over photovoltaic cells are higher efficiency of converting sunlight into electricity and longer lifetime.
Parabolic dish systems give the highest efficiency among CSP technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = An Assessment of Solar Energy Conversion Technologies and Research Opportunities |publisher = Stanford University – Global Climate Change &amp; Energy Project |url = http://gcep.stanford.edu/pdfs/assessments/solar_assessment.pdf |access-date = 2 July 2008 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080509182125/http://gcep.stanford.edu/pdfs/assessments/solar_assessment.pdf |archive-date = 9 May 2008 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The 50&amp;nbsp;kW [[The Big Dish (solar thermal)|Big Dish]] in [[Canberra]], Australia is an example of this technology.&lt;ref name="SolarPaces 2001"&gt;{{cite web |title=Concentrating Solar Power in 2001 – An IEA/SolarPACES Summary of Present Status and Future Prospects |publisher=International Energy Agency – SolarPACES |url=http://www.solarpaces.org/Library/docs/CSP_Brochure_2001.pdf |access-date=2 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910052052/http://www.solarpaces.org/Library/docs/CSP_Brochure_2001.pdf |archive-date=10 September 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''solar power tower'' uses an array of tracking reflectors ([[heliostat]]s) to concentrate light on a central receiver atop a tower. Power towers can achieve higher (thermal-to-electricity conversion) efficiency than linear tracking CSP schemes and better energy storage capability than dish stirling technologies.&lt;ref name="SolarPaces 2001"/&gt; The [[PS10 Solar Power Plant]] and [[PS20 solar power plant]] are examples of this technology.

=== Hybrid systems ===

A hybrid system combines (C)PV and CSP with one another or with other forms of generation such as diesel, wind and [[biogas]]. The combined form of generation may enable the system to modulate power output as a function of demand or at least reduce the fluctuating nature of solar power and the consumption of non-renewable fuel. Hybrid systems are most often found on islands.

; CPV/CSP system
: A novel solar CPV/CSP hybrid system has been proposed, combining concentrator photovoltaics with the non-PV technology of concentrated solar power, or also known as concentrated solar thermal.&lt;ref&gt;Phys.org [http://phys.org/news/2015-02-solar-cpvcsp-hybrid.html A novel solar CPV/CSP hybrid system proposed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822040505/http://phys.org/news/2015-02-solar-cpvcsp-hybrid.html |date=22 August 2015 }}, 11 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Integrated solar combined cycle]] (ISCC) system
: The [[Hassi R'Mel integrated solar combined cycle power station|Hassi R'Mel power station]] in Algeria is an example of combining CSP with a gas turbine, where a 25-megawatt CSP-[[parabolic trough]] array supplements a much larger 130&amp;nbsp;MW [[combined cycle]] gas turbine plant. Another example is the [[Yazd integrated solar combined cycle power station|Yazd power station]] in Iran.
; [[Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector]] (PVT)
: Also known as hybrid PV/T, convert solar radiation into thermal and electrical energy. Such a system combines a solar (PV) module with a [[solar thermal collector]] in a complementary way.
; [[Concentrated photovoltaics and thermal]] (CPVT)
: A concentrated photovoltaic thermal hybrid system is similar to a PVT system. It uses [[concentrated photovoltaic]]s (CPV) instead of conventional PV technology, and combines it with a solar thermal collector.
; [[PV diesel system]]
: It combines a photovoltaic system with a [[diesel generator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Is a Photovoltaic Diesel Hybrid System? |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/blog/post/2014/01/what-is-a-photovoltaic-diesel-hybrid-system |author=Amanda Cain |website=RenewableEnergyWorld.com |date=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combinations with [[Hybrid renewable energy system|other renewables]] are possible and include [[wind turbines]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/hybrid-wind-and-solar-electric-systems |title=Hybrid Wind and Solar Electric Systems |publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]] |date=2 July 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526061658/http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/hybrid-wind-and-solar-electric-systems |archive-date=26 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; PV-[[Thermogenerator|thermoelectric]] system
: Thermoelectric, or "thermovoltaic" devices convert a temperature difference between dissimilar materials into an electric current. Solar cells use only the high frequency part of the radiation, while the low frequency heat energy is wasted. Several patents about the use of thermoelectric devices in tandem with solar cells have been filed.&lt;ref name=Kraemer&gt;{{citation
|title= Photovoltaic-thermoelectric hybrid systems: A general optimization methodology|last1 = Kraemer|first1 = D|last2 = Hu|first2 = L|last3 = Muto|first3 = A|last4 = Chen|first4 = X |last5 = Chen|first5 =G|last6 = Chiesa|first6 =M|journal = Applied Physics Letters|volume= 92|issue = 24|page= 243503|year=2008|doi = 10.1063/1.2947591|bibcode = 2008ApPhL..92x3503K}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The idea is to increase the efficiency of the combined solar/thermoelectric system to convert the solar radiation into useful electricity.

=== Early days ===

The early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce. [[Charles Fritts]] installed the world's first rooftop photovoltaic solar array, using 1%-efficient [[selenium]] cells, on a New York City roof in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2014/12/31/photovoltaic-dreaming-first-attempts-commercializing-pv/|title=Photovoltaic Dreaming 1875--1905: First Attempts At Commercializing PV - CleanTechnica|author=|date=31 December 2014|website=[[cleantechnica.com]]|access-date=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170525170459/https://cleantechnica.com/2014/12/31/photovoltaic-dreaming-first-attempts-commercializing-pv/|archive-date=25 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century in the face of the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and [[petroleum]].&lt;ref&gt;Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 63, 77, 101&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 it was estimated that only six private homes in all of North America were entirely heated or cooled by functional solar power systems.&lt;ref&gt;"The Solar Energy Book-Once More." ''[[Mother Earth News]]'' 31:16–17, Jan. 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1973 oil crisis|1973 oil embargo]] and [[1979 energy crisis]] caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yergin (1991), pp. 634, 653–673&lt;/ref&gt; Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the US and the Sunshine Program in Japan. Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the United States (SERI, now [[NREL]]), Japan ([[New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization|NEDO]]), and Germany ([[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer–ISE]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Chronicle of Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft | publisher=Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft | url=http://www.fraunhofer.de/EN/company/profile/chronicle/1972-1982.jsp | access-date=4 November 2007 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212091650/http://www.fraunhofer.de/EN/company/profile/chronicle/1972-1982.jsp | archive-date=12 December 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Between 1970 and 1983 installations of photovoltaic systems grew rapidly, but falling oil prices in the early 1980s moderated the [[growth of photovoltaics]] from 1984 to 1996.

=== Mid-1990s to early 2010s ===

In the mid-1990s development of both, residential and commercial [[rooftop solar]] as well as utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station]]s began to accelerate again due to supply issues with oil and natural gas, global warming concerns, and the improving economic position of PV relative to other energy technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solardev.com/SEIA-lightworld.php Solar: photovoltaic: Lighting Up The World] retrieved 19 May 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813163816/http://www.solardev.com/SEIA-lightworld.php |date=13 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s, the adoption of [[feed-in tariff]]s—a policy mechanism, that gives renewables priority on the grid and defines a fixed price for the generated electricity—led to a high level of investment security and to a soaring number of PV deployments in Europe.

=== Current status ===
For several years, worldwide growth of solar PV was driven by [[Solar power in the European Union|European deployment]], but has since shifted to Asia, especially [[Solar power in China|China]] and [[Solar power in Japan|Japan]], and to a growing number of countries and regions all over the world, including, but not limited to, [[Solar power in Australia|Australia]], [[Solar power in Canada|Canada]], [[Solar power in Chile|Chile]], [[Solar power in India|India]], [[Solar power in Israel|Israel]], [[Solar power in Mexico|Mexico]], [[Solar power in South Africa|South Africa]], [[Energy in South Korea|South Korea]], [[Solar power in Thailand|Thailand]], and the [[Solar power in the United States|United States]].

Worldwide growth of photovoltaics has averaged 40% per year from 2000 to 2013&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and total installed capacity reached 303&amp;nbsp;GW at the end of 2016 with [[Solar power in China|China]] having the most cumulative installations (78&amp;nbsp;GW)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/statistics/IEA-PVPS_-_A_Snapshot_of_Global_PV_-_1992-2016__1_.pdf|title=2016 Snapshot of Global Photovoltaic Markets|last=|first=|date=2017|website=International Energy Agency|access-date=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827050437/http://www.iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/statistics/IEA-PVPS_-_A_Snapshot_of_Global_PV_-_1992-2016__1_.pdf|archive-date=27 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Solar power in Honduras|Honduras]] having the highest theoretical percentage of annual electricity usage which could be generated by solar PV (12.5%).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewablesinternational.net/overview-of-installed-pv-in-2013/150/452/75985/|title=Photovoltaics: Overview of installed PV in 2013|publisher=Renewables International|date=14 January 2014|access-date=23 June 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330022600/http://www.renewablesinternational.net/overview-of-installed-pv-in-2013/150/452/75985/|archive-date=30 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest manufacturers are located in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pv-tech.org/editors-blog/45754|title=Top-10 solar cell producers in 2016|first=Finlay|last=Colville|work=PV-Tech|date=30 January 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202054912/http://www.pv-tech.org/editors-blog/45754|archive-date=2 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www-cdn.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Executive-Summary-The-New-Solar-System-1.pdf|title=The New Solar System - Executive Summary|last=Ball|first=Jeffrey |display-authors=etal |date=2017-03-21|website=Stanford University Law School, Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance|access-date=2017-06-27|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420151310/https://www-cdn.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Executive-Summary-The-New-Solar-System-1.pdf|archive-date=20 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concentrated solar power (CSP) also started to grow rapidly, increasing its capacity nearly tenfold from 2004 to 2013, albeit from a lower level and involving fewer countries than solar PV.&lt;ref name="ren21-gsr-2014"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |title=Renewables 2014: Global Status Report |author=REN21 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140915214208/http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |archive-date=15 September 2014 |year=2014 
 |url-status=live |df=dmy |author-link=REN21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}} 
As of the end of 2013, [[Concentrated solar power#Deployment around the world|worldwide cumulative CSP-capacity]] reached 3,425&amp;nbsp;MW.

=== Forecasts ===

In 2010, the [[International Energy Agency]] predicted that global solar PV capacity could reach 3,000 GW or 11% of projected global electricity generation by 2050—enough to generate 4,500&amp;nbsp;[[terawatt-hour|TWh]] of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/pv_roadmap_foldout.pdf |title=Solar photovoltaic roadmap |publisher=International Energy Agency |date=2010 |access-date=18 August 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924042430/http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/pv_roadmap_foldout.pdf |archive-date=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Four years later, in 2014, the agency projected that, under its "high renewables" scenario, solar power could supply 27% of global electricity generation by 2050 (16% from PV and 11% from CSP).&lt;ref name=IEA-roadmap-PV-2014 /&gt;

=== Photovoltaic power stations ===
{{Main|Photovoltaic power station|List of photovoltaic power stations}}

The [[Desert Sunlight Solar Farm]] is a 550&amp;nbsp;MW power plant in [[Riverside County, California]], that uses [[Thin film solar cell|thin-film]] [[CdTe solar module]]s made by [[First Solar]].&lt;ref name=rew11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/09/doe-closes-on-three-major-solar-projects |title=DOE Closes on Four Major Solar Projects |date=30 September 2011 |work=Renewable Energy World |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111021243/http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/09/doe-closes-on-three-major-solar-projects |archive-date=11 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2014, the 550 megawatt [[Topaz Solar Farm]] was the largest photovoltaic power plant in the world. This was surpassed by the 579 MW [[Solar Star]] complex. The current largest photovoltaic power station in the world is the [[Pavagada Solar Park]], Karnataka, [[India]] with a generation capacity of 2050 MW.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Concentrating solar power stations ===
{{Main|List of solar thermal power stations}}
[[File:IvanpahRunning.JPG|thumb|[[Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System]] with all three towers under load during February 2014, with the [[Clark Mountain Range]] seen in the distance]]
[[File:Solar Plant kl.jpg|thumb|Part of the 354 MW [[Solar Energy Generating Systems]] (SEGS) [[parabolic trough]] solar complex in northern [[San Bernardino County, California]] ]]
Commercial concentrating solar power (CSP) plants, also called "solar thermal power stations", were first developed in the 1980s. The 377&amp;nbsp; MW [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]], located in California's Mojave Desert, is the world's largest solar thermal power plant project. Other large CSP plants include the [[Solnova Solar Power Station]] (150&amp;nbsp;MW), the [[Andasol solar power station]] (150&amp;nbsp;MW), and [[Extresol Solar Power Station]] (150&amp;nbsp;MW), all in Spain. The principal advantage of CSP is the ability to efficiently add thermal storage, allowing the dispatching of electricity over up to a 24-hour period. Since peak electricity demand typically occurs at about 5&amp;nbsp;pm, many CSP power plants use 3 to 5&amp;nbsp;hours of thermal storage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energex.com.au/sustainability/sustainability-rewards-programs/what-is-peak-demand What is peak demand?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811072202/http://www.energex.com.au/sustainability/sustainability-rewards-programs/what-is-peak-demand |date=11 August 2012 }}, Energex.com.au website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical cost factors for solar power include the costs of the modules, the frame to hold them, wiring, inverters, labour cost, any land that might be required, the grid connection, maintenance and the solar insolation that location will receive. Adjusting for inflation, it cost $96 per watt for a solar module in the mid-1970s. Process improvements and a very large boost in production have brought that figure down to 68 cents per watt in February 2016, according to data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-solar-power-buffett-vs-musk/|title=Musk vs. Buffett: The Billionaire Battle to Own the Sun|work=Bloomberg.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216024255/https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-solar-power-buffett-vs-musk/|archive-date=16 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Palo Alto]] California signed a wholesale purchase agreement in 2016 that secured solar power for 3.7 cents per kilowatt-hour. And in sunny [[Dubai]] large-scale solar generated electricity sold in 2016 for just 2.99 cents per kilowatt-hour – "competitive with any form of fossil-based electricity — and cheaper than most."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-4-solar-power-stocks-will-leave-fossil-fuels-in-the-dust-2016-07-18?link=MW_popular%7Ctitle=These|title=These 4 solar-power stocks will leave fossil fuels in the dust|first=Garvin|last=Jabusch|date=|website=marketwatch.com|access-date=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819230343/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-4-solar-power-stocks-will-leave-fossil-fuels-in-the-dust-2016-07-18?link=MW_popular%7Ctitle=These|archive-date=19 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photovoltaic systems use no fuel, and modules typically last 25 to 40 years. Thus, capital costs make up most of the cost of solar power. Operations and maintenance costs for new utility-scale solar plants in the US are estimated to be 9 percent of the cost of photovoltaic electricity, and 17 percent of the cost of solar thermal electricity.&lt;ref&gt;US EIA, [http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm Levelized Cost and Levelized Avoided Cost of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027231537/http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm |date=27 October 2015 }}, 17 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Governments have created various financial incentives to encourage the use of solar power, such as [[feed-in tariff]] programs. Also, [[Renewable portfolio standard]]s impose a government mandate &lt;!-- Without any discussion of how these mandates impact the economics of solar power, these two sentences discussing RSPs look out of place in this subsection --&gt; that utilities generate or acquire a certain percentage of renewable power regardless of increased energy procurement costs. In most states, RPS goals can be achieved by any combination of solar, wind, biomass, [[landfill gas]], ocean, geothermal, [[municipal solid waste]], hydroelectric, hydrogen, or fuel cell technologies.&lt;ref name="ajelp.com"&gt;Robert Glennon and Andrew M. Reeves, Solar Energy's Cloudy Future, 1 Ariz. J. Evtl. L. &amp; Pol'y, 91, 106 (2010) available at {{cite web|url=http://ajelp.com/documents/GlennonFinal.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811064518/http://ajelp.com/documents/GlennonFinal.pdf |archive-date=11 August 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Levelized cost of electricity ====

The PV industry has adopted [[levelized cost of electricity]] (LCOE) as the unit of cost. The electrical energy generated is sold in units of [[kilowatt-hour]]s (kWh). As a rule of thumb, and depending on the local [[insolation]], 1 watt-peak of installed solar PV capacity generates about 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;kWh of electricity per year. This corresponds to a [[capacity factor]] of around 10–20%. The product of the local cost of electricity and the insolation determines the break-even point for solar power. The International Conference on Solar Photovoltaic Investments, organized by [[European Photovoltaic Industry Association|EPIA]], has estimated that PV systems will pay back their investors in 8 to 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pvinvestmentconference.org |title=3rd International Conference on Solar Photovoltaic Investments |publisher=Pvinvestmentconference.org |access-date=19 April 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503114036/http://www.pvinvestmentconference.org/ |archive-date=3 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, since 2006 it has been economical for investors to install photovoltaics for free in return for a long term [[power purchase agreement]]. Fifty percent of commercial systems in the United States were installed in this manner in 2007 and over 90% by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gtmresearch.com/report/solar-power-services-how-ppas-are-changing-the-pv-value-chain | title=Solar Power Services: How PPAs are Changing the PV Value Chain | date=11 February 2008 | access-date=21 May 2009 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510082253/http://www.gtmresearch.com/report/solar-power-services-how-ppas-are-changing-the-pv-value-chain | archive-date=10 May 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shi Zhengrong]] has said that, as of 2012, unsubsidised solar power is already competitive with fossil fuels in India, Hawaii, Italy and Spain. He said "We are at a tipping point. No longer are renewable power sources like solar and wind a luxury of the rich. They are now starting to compete in the real world without subsidies". "Solar power will be able to compete without subsidies against conventional power sources in half the world by 2015".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/Story/story/print?guid=F4031B1C-52B9-11E1-A6A2-002128040CF6 |title=China's visible solar power success |author=Mark Clifford |date=8 February 2012 |work=MarketWatch |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801064435/http://www.marketwatch.com/Story/story/print?guid=F4031B1C-52B9-11E1-A6A2-002128040CF6 |archive-date=1 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Current installation prices ====
{{Utility scale PV prices by country}}
In its 2014 edition of the ''Technology Roadmap: Solar Photovoltaic Energy'' report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) published prices for residential, commercial and utility-scale [[PV system]]s for eight major markets as of 2013 ''(see table below)''.&lt;ref name=IEA-roadmap-PV-2014 /&gt; However, DOE's [[SunShot Initiative]] has reported much lower U.S. installation prices. In 2014, prices continued to decline. The SunShot Initiative modeled U.S. system prices to be in the range of $1.80 to $3.29 per watt.&lt;ref name="sunshot-2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/62558.pdf |title=Photovoltaic System Pricing Trends – Historical, Recent, and Near-Term Projections, 2014 Edition |publisher=NREL |page=4 |date=22 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226074251/http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/62558.pdf |archive-date=26 February 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources identify similar price ranges of $1.70 to $3.50 for the different market segments in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;GreenTechMedia.com [http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-pv-system-prices-continue-to-fall-during-a-record-breaking-2014 Solar PV Pricing Continues to Fall During a Record-Breaking 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525165540/https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-pv-system-prices-continue-to-fall-during-a-record-breaking-2014 |date=25 May 2017 }}, 13 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and in the highly penetrated German market, prices for residential and small commercial rooftop systems of up to 100&amp;nbsp;kW declined to $1.36 per watt (€1.24/W) by the end of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photovoltaik-guide.de/pv-preisindex |title=Photovoltaik-Preisindex |trans-title=Solar PV price index |publisher=PhotovoltaikGuide |quote=Turnkey net-prices for a solar PV system of up to 100 kWp amounted to Euro 1,240 per kWp. |access-date=30 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710020014/http://www.photovoltaik-guide.de/pv-preisindex |archive-date=10 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Deutsche Bank estimated costs for small residential rooftop systems in the U.S. around $2.90 per watt.

=== Grid parity ===
{{main|Grid parity}}

Grid parity, the point at which the cost of photovoltaic electricity is equal to or cheaper than the price of [[grid power]], is more easily achieved in areas with abundant sun and high costs for electricity such as in [[California]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=9013609&amp;contentId=7005395 Going for grid parity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608081013/http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=9013609&amp;contentId=7005395 |date=8 June 2011 }} 2005 article&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the levelized cost of electricity for solar PV was $0.25/kWh or less in most of the [[OECD]] countries. By late 2011, the fully loaded cost was predicted to fall below $0.15/kWh for most of the [[OECD]] and to reach $0.10/kWh in sunnier regions. These cost levels are driving three emerging trends: vertical integration of the supply chain, origination of [[power purchase agreement]]s (PPAs) by solar power companies, and unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies, [[grid operator]]s and [[wind turbine manufacturer]]s.&lt;ref name=truecost&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photon-consulting.com/en/true_cost_2007/summary.htm |title=THE TRUE COST OF SOLAR POWER: 10 Cents/kWh by 2010 |last1=Conkling |first1=Joel |last2=Rogol |first2=Michael |access-date=22 October 2008| url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908113041/http://www.photon-consulting.com/en/true_cost_2007/summary.htm |archive-date=8 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[General Electric]]'s Chief Engineer predicted grid parity without subsidies in sunny parts of the United States by around 2015; other companies predicted an earlier date:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSL1878986220071019|title=Solar power edges towards boom time|author=Reuters Editorial|date=19 October 2007|work=Reuters|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722210645/http://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSL1878986220071019|archive-date=22 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the cost of solar power will be below grid parity for more than half of residential customers and 10% of commercial customers in the [[OECD]], as long as grid electricity prices do not decrease through 2010.&lt;ref name=truecost /&gt;

===Productivity by location===
{{see also|Solar irradiance}}
The productivity of solar power in a region depends on [[solar irradiance]], which varies through the day and is influenced by [[latitude]] and [[climate]].

The locations with highest annual solar irradiance lie in the arid tropics and subtropics. Deserts lying in low latitudes usually have few clouds, and can receive sunshine for more than ten hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slideplayer.com/slide/7652063/25/images/3/Daytime+Cloud+Fraction+Coast+lines+evident.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-08-22 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822174443/http://slideplayer.com/slide/7652063/25/images/3/Daytime+Cloud+Fraction+Coast+lines+evident.jpg |archive-date=22 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.econet.org.uk/weather/sun.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-09-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923233148/http://www.econet.org.uk/weather/sun.html |archive-date=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These hot deserts form the ''Global Sun Belt'' circling the world.

=== Self consumption ===

In cases of self-consumption of solar energy, the payback time is calculated based on how much electricity is not purchased from the grid. For example, in Germany, with electricity prices of 0.25 €/kWh and [[insolation]] of 900 kWh/kW, one kWp will save €225 per year, and with an installation cost of 1700 €/KWp the system cost will be returned in less than seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ahl2afL-jL0BdEVGU3dsbllfTzlxMEV0aTNqT0d5Nnc&amp;output=html|title=Money saved by producing electricity from PV and Years for payback|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228114744/https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ahl2afL-jL0BdEVGU3dsbllfTzlxMEV0aTNqT0d5Nnc&amp;output=html|archive-date=28 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in many cases, the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide, and some or all of the energy is fed back into the grid. The electricity is sold, and at other times when energy is taken from the grid, electricity is bought. The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics. In many markets, the price paid for sold PV electricity is significantly lower than the price of bought electricity, which incentivizes self consumption.&lt;ref name="iea-pvps-trends-2014"&gt;{{cite report |title=Trends in Photovoltaic Applications 2014 |publisher=IEA-PVPS |date=2014 |url=http://iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/statistics/IEA_PVPS_Trends_2014_in_PV_Applications_-_lr.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525165925/http://iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/statistics/IEA_PVPS_Trends_2014_in_PV_Applications_-_lr.pdf |archive-date=25 May 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, separate self consumption incentives have been used in e.g. Germany and Italy.&lt;ref name="iea-pvps-trends-2014"/&gt; Grid interaction regulation has also included limitations of grid feed-in in some regions in Germany with high amounts of installed PV capacity.&lt;ref name="iea-pvps-trends-2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stetz |first=T |last2=Marten |first2=F |last3=Braun |first3=M |title=Improved Low Voltage Grid-Integration of Photovoltaic Systems in Germany |journal=IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy |date=2013 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=534–542 |doi=10.1109/TSTE.2012.2198925|bibcode=2013ITSE....4..534S }}&lt;/ref&gt; By increasing self consumption, the grid feed-in can be limited without curtailment, which wastes electricity.&lt;ref name="salpakari-lund-2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Salpakari |first=Jyri |last2=Lund |first2=Peter |title=Optimal and rule-based control strategies for energy flexibility in buildings with PV |journal=Applied Energy |date=2016 |volume=161 |pages=425–436 |doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.10.036|url=https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/25788 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy pricing and incentives ===
{{Main|PV financial incentives}}

The political purpose of incentive policies for PV is to facilitate an initial small-scale deployment to begin to grow the industry, even where the cost of PV is significantly above grid parity, to allow the industry to achieve the economies of scale necessary to reach grid parity. The policies are implemented to promote national energy independence, high tech job creation and reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Three incentive mechanisms are often used in combination as investment subsidies: the authorities refund part of the cost of installation of the system, the electricity utility buys PV electricity from the producer under a multiyear contract at a guaranteed rate, and [[Solar Renewable Energy Certificates]] (SRECs)

==== Rebates ====

With investment subsidies, the financial burden falls upon the taxpayer, while with feed-in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities' customer bases. While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument in favour of feed-in tariffs is the encouragement of quality. Investment subsidies are paid out as a function of the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time, thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance. Some electric companies offer rebates to their customers, such as [[Austin Energy]] in [[Texas]], which offers $2.50/watt installed up to $15,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinenergy.com/Energy%20Efficiency/Programs/Rebates/Solar%20Rebates/index.htm Solar Rebate Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725015516/http://www.austinenergy.com/Energy%20Efficiency/Programs/Rebates/Solar%20Rebates/index.htm |date=25 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Net metering ====
[[File:Feed-in Tariff meter connections.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Net metering]], unlike a [[feed-in tariff]], requires only one meter, but it must be bi-directional.]]

In [[net metering]] the price of the electricity produced is the same as the price supplied to the consumer, and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard [[electricity meter]]s, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. With net metering, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/solarpolicyguide/?id=17 Net Metering] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021172839/http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/solarpolicyguide/?id=17 |date=21 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits. In New Jersey, annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate, as are left over credits when a customer terminates service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njcleanenergy.com/renewable-energy/programs/net-metering-and-interconnection|title=Net Metering and Interconnection - NJ OCE Web Site|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512060609/http://www.njcleanenergy.com/renewable-energy/programs/net-metering-and-interconnection|archive-date=12 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Feed-in tariffs (FIT) ====
{{update section|date=August 2018}}
With [[feed-in tariff]]s, the financial burden falls upon the consumer. They reward the number of kilowatt-hours produced over a long period of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment. The price paid per kilowatt-hour under a feed-in tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity. Net metering refers to the case where the price paid by the utility is the same as the price charged.

The complexity of approvals in California, Spain and Italy has prevented comparable growth to Germany even though the return on investment is better.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}} In some countries, additional incentives are offered for [[building-integrated photovoltaics]] (BIPV) compared to stand alone PV.
* France + EUR 0.16 /kWh (compared to semi-integrated) or + EUR 0.27/kWh (compared to stand alone)
* Italy + EUR 0.04–0.09 kWh
* Germany + EUR 0.05/kWh (facades only)

==== Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) ====

Alternatively, [[Solar Renewable Energy Certificate]]s (SRECs) allow for a market mechanism to set the price of the solar-generated electricity subsidy. In this mechanism, renewable energy production or consumption target is set, and the utility (more technically the Load Serving Entity) is obliged to purchase renewable energy or face a fine (Alternative Compliance Payment or ACP). The producer is credited for an SREC for every 1,000&amp;nbsp;kWh of electricity produced. If the utility buys this SREC and retires it, they avoid paying the ACP. In principle, this system delivers the cheapest renewable energy since all solar facilities are eligible and can be installed in most economic locations. Uncertainties about the future value of SRECs have led to long-term SREC contract markets to give clarity to their prices and allow solar developers to pre-sell and hedge their credits.

Financial incentives for photovoltaics differ across countries, including [[Solar power in Australia|Australia]], [[Solar power in China|China]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/32551044/site/14081545 China Racing Ahead of America in the Drive to Go Solar]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706133417/http://www.cnbc.com/id/32551044/site/14081545 |date=6 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar power in Germany|Germany]],&lt;ref name="German PV market"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarbuzz.com/FastFactsGermany.htm|title=Power &amp; Energy Technology - IHS Technology|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102171748/http://solarbuzz.com/FastFactsGermany.htm|archive-date=2 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar power in Israel|Israel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng.shirasol.co.il/Approved-Feed-in-tariff-in-Israel.htm Approved — Feed-in tariff in Israel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603195611/http://eng.shirasol.co.il/Approved-Feed-in-tariff-in-Israel.htm |date=3 June 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar power in Japan|Japan]], and the [[Solar power in the United States|United States]] and even across states within the US.

The Japanese government through its [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] ran a successful programme of subsidies from 1994 to 2003. By the end of 2004, Japan led the world in installed PV capacity with over 1.1&amp;nbsp;[[Gigawatt|GW]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070208104905/http://www.oja-services.nl/iea-pvps/isr/22.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the German government introduced the first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under the [[German Renewable Energy Act]], which resulted in an explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset, the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, in order to encourage the industry to pass on lower costs to the end-users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.

Subsequently, [[Solar power in Spain|Spain]], [[Solar power in Italy|Italy]], [[Solar power in Greece|Greece]]—that enjoyed an early success with domestic solar-thermal installations for hot water needs—and [[Solar power in France|France]] introduced feed-in tariffs. None have replicated the programmed decrease of FIT in new contracts though, making the German incentive relatively less and less attractive compared to other countries. The French and Greek FIT offer a high premium (EUR 0.55/kWh) for building integrated systems. California, Greece, France and Italy have 30–50% more insolation than Germany making them financially more attractive. The Greek domestic "solar roof" programme (adopted in June 2009 for installations up to 10&amp;nbsp;kW) has internal rates of return of 10–15% at current commercial installation costs, which, furthermore, is tax-free.

In 2006 [[Solar power in California|California]] approved the '[[California Solar Initiative]]', offering a choice of investment subsidies or FIT for small and medium systems and a FIT for large systems. The small-system FIT of $0.39 per kWh (far less than EU countries) expires in just 5 years, and the alternate "EPBB" residential investment incentive is modest, averaging perhaps 20% of the cost. All California incentives are scheduled to decrease in the future depending as a function of the amount of PV capacity installed.

At the end of 2006, the Ontario Power Authority (OPA, Canada) began its Standard Offer Program, a precursor to the [[Green Energy Act 2009|Green Energy Act]], and the first in North America for distributed renewable projects of less than 10&amp;nbsp; MW. The feed-in tariff guaranteed a fixed price of $0.42 CDN per kWh over a period of twenty years. Unlike net metering, all the electricity produced was sold to the OPA at the given rate.

The overwhelming majority of electricity produced worldwide is used immediately since storage is usually more expensive and because traditional generators can adapt to demand. Both solar power and [[wind power]] are [[variable renewable energy]], meaning that all available output must be taken whenever it is available by moving through [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] lines to ''where it can be used now''. Since solar energy is not available at night, storing its energy is potentially an important issue particularly in off-grid and for future [[100% renewable energy]] scenarios to have continuous electricity availability.&lt;ref&gt;Carr (1976), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar electricity is inherently variable and predictable by time of day, location, and seasons. In addition, solar is intermittent due to day/night cycles and unpredictable weather. How much of a special challenge solar power is in any given electric utility varies significantly. In a [[summer peak]] utility, solar is well matched to daytime cooling demands. In [[winter peak]] utilities, solar displaces other forms of generation, reducing their [[capacity factor]]s.

In an electricity system without [[grid energy storage]], generation from stored fuels (coal, biomass, natural gas, nuclear) must go up and down in reaction to the rise and fall of solar electricity (see [[load following power plant]]). While hydroelectric and natural gas plants can quickly respond to changes in load, coal, biomass and nuclear plants usually take considerable time to respond to load and can only be scheduled to follow the predictable variation. Depending on local circumstances, beyond about 20–40% of total generation, grid-connected [[intermittent energy source|intermittent source]]s like solar tend to require investment in some combination of [[Super grid|grid interconnections]], [[Grid energy storage|energy storage]] or [[Energy demand management|demand side management]]. Integrating large amounts of solar power with existing generation equipment has caused issues in some cases. For example, in Germany, California and Hawaii, electricity prices have been known to go negative when solar is generating a lot of power, displacing existing [[baseload]] generation contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/california-sun-solar-power-electricity-energy-prices-negative-renewables-green-climate-change-fossil-a7678086.html|title=California produced so much solar power, electricity prices just turned negative|author=|date=11 April 2017|website=independent.co.uk|access-date=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211175722/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/california-sun-solar-power-electricity-energy-prices-negative-renewables-green-climate-change-fossil-a7678086.html|archive-date=11 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/3-reasons-hawaii-put-the-brakes-on-solar-and-why-the-same-won-t-happen-in-your-state/|title=3 Reasons Hawaii Put the Brakes on Solar--and Why the Same Won't Happen in Your State|first=Robert|last=Fares|date=|website=scientificamerican.com|access-date=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920121552/http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/3-reasons-hawaii-put-the-brakes-on-solar-and-why-the-same-won-t-happen-in-your-state/|archive-date=20 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional hydroelectricity works very well in conjunction with solar power; water can be held back or released from a reservoir as required. Where a suitable river is not available, [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] uses solar power to pump water to a high reservoir on sunny days, then the energy is recovered at night and in bad weather by releasing water via a hydroelectric plant to a low reservoir where the cycle can begin again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pumped Hydro Storage  |publisher=Electricity Storage Association  |url=http://www.electricitystorage.org/tech/technologies_technologies_pumpedhydro.htm  |access-date=31 July 2008  |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621052054/http://www.electricitystorage.org/tech/technologies_technologies_pumpedhydro.htm  |archive-date=21 June 2008  |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This cycle can lose 20% of the energy to round trip inefficiencies, this plus the construction costs add to the expense of implementing high levels of solar power.

[[Concentrated solar power]] plants may use [[thermal energy storage|thermal storage]] to store solar energy, such as in high-temperature molten salts. These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the [[The Solar Project|Solar Two]] power station, allowing it to store 1.44&amp;nbsp;[[Terajoules|TJ]] in its 68&amp;nbsp;m³ storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Advantages of Using Molten Salt |publisher = Sandia National Laboratory |url = http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/solarthermal/NSTTF/salt.htm |access-date = 29 September 2007 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110605094349/http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/solarthermal/NSTTF/salt.htm |archive-date = 5 June 2011 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Photovoltaic system#Standalone system|stand alone PV systems]] [[rechargeable batteries|batteries]] are traditionally used to store excess electricity. With [[grid-connected photovoltaic power system]], excess electricity can be sent to the [[electrical grid]]. [[Net metering]] and [[feed-in tariff]] programs give these systems a credit for the electricity they produce. This credit offsets electricity provided from the grid when the system cannot meet demand, effectively trading with the grid instead of storing excess electricity. Credits are normally rolled over from month to month and any remaining surplus settled annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PV Systems and Net Metering |publisher=Department of Energy |url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/net_metering.html |accessdate=31 July 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080704062311/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/net_metering.html |archivedate=4 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
When wind and solar are a small fraction of the grid power, other generation techniques can adjust their output appropriately, but as these forms of variable power grow, additional balance on the grid is needed. As prices are rapidly declining, PV systems increasingly use rechargeable batteries to store a surplus to be later used at night. [[Grid energy storage#Batteries|Batteries used for grid-storage]] stabilize the [[electrical grid]] by [[Grid energy storage#Load leveling|leveling out peak loads]] usually for several minutes, and in rare cases for hours. In the future, less expensive batteries could play an important role on the electrical grid, as they can charge during periods when generation exceeds demand and feed their stored energy into the grid when demand is higher than generation.

Although not permitted under the US National Electric Code, it is technically possible to have a “[[plug and play]]” PV microinverter. A recent review article found that careful system design would enable such systems to meet all technical, though not all safety requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mundada | first1 = Aishwarya S. | last2 = Nilsiam | first2 = Yuenyong | last3 = Pearce | first3 = Joshua M. | year = 2016| title = A review of technical requirements for plug-and-play solar photovoltaic micro-inverter systems in the United States | url = https://www.academia.edu/26379506 | journal = Solar Energy | volume = 135 | issue = | pages = 455–470 | doi = 10.1016/j.solener.2016.06.002 | bibcode = 2016SoEn..135..455M }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several companies selling plug and play solar systems available on the web, but there is a concern that if people install their own it will reduce the enormous employment advantage solar has over [[fossil fuels]].&lt;ref&gt;Platzer, M.D., 2012.

Common battery technologies used in today's home PV systems include, the [[valve regulated lead-acid battery]]– a modified version of the conventional [[lead–acid battery]], [[nickel–cadmium battery|nickel–cadmium]] and [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion]] batteries. Lead-acid batteries are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self-discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. Lithium-ion batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to [[economies of scale]] provided by large production facilities such as the [[Gigafactory 1]]. In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in [[electric car]]s may serve as future storage devices in a [[vehicle-to-grid]] system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95% of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back. Other rechargeable batteries used for [[distributed energy storage system|distributed]] PV systems include, [[Sodium–sulfur battery|sodium–sulfur]] and [[Vanadium redox battery|vanadium redox]] batteries, two prominent types of a [[Molten salt battery|molten salt]] and a [[Flow battery|flow]] battery, respectively.&lt;ref name=ethz-harvard&gt;{{cite web |publisher=ETH Zürich, Harvard University |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264239770 |title=The Economic Viability of Battery Storage for Residential Solar Photovoltaic Systems - A Review and a Simulation Model |author1=Joern Hoppmann |author2=Jonas Volland |author3=Tobias S.

The combination of wind and solar PV has the advantage that the two sources complement each other because the peak operating times for each system occur at different times of the day and year. The power generation of such [[solar hybrid power systems]] is therefore more constant and fluctuates less than each of the two component subsystems.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Solar power is seasonal, particularly in northern/southern climates, away from the equator, suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage in a medium such as hydrogen or pumped hydroelectric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/aee9/8815cc874423e67af5fd9bf8eac612b56ea6.pdf|title=Seasonal Energy Storage in a Renewable Energy System|author=|date=|website=semanticscholar.org|access-date=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525170317/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/aee9/8815cc874423e67af5fd9bf8eac612b56ea6.pdf|archive-date=25 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the [[University of Kassel]] pilot-tested a [[virtual power plant|combined power plant]] linking solar, wind, [[biogas]] and [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] to provide load-following power from renewable sources.&lt;ref name="combined_power_plant"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.solarserver.de/solarmagazin/anlagejanuar2008_e.html |title = The Combined Power Plant: the first stage in providing 100% power from renewable energy |date = January 2008 |access-date = 10 October 2008 |publisher = SolarServer |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081014054221/http://www.solarserver.de/solarmagazin/anlagejanuar2008_e.html |archive-date = 14 October 2008 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research is also undertaken in this field of [[artificial photosynthesis]]. It involves the use of [[nanotechnology]] to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds, by splitting water to produce [[hydrogen fuel]] or then combining with carbon dioxide to make biopolymers such as [[methanol]]. Many large national and regional research projects on artificial photosynthesis are now trying to develop techniques integrating improved light capture, quantum coherence methods of electron transfer and cheap catalytic materials that operate under a variety of atmospheric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Collings AF, Critchley C.

== Environmental impacts ==
[[File:Blick vom aussichtsturm hörlitz4.jpg|thumb|Part of the [[Senftenberg Solarpark]], a solar [[photovoltaic]] power plant located on former open-pit mining areas close to the city of [[Senftenberg]], in Eastern Germany. The 78 MW Phase 1 of the plant was completed within three months.]]

Unlike [[fossil fuel]] based technologies, solar power does not lead to any harmful emissions during operation, but the production of the panels leads to some amount of pollution.

=== Greenhouse gases ===

The [[life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of solar power]] are in the range of 22 to 46&amp;nbsp;gram (g) per [[kilowatt-hour]] (kWh) depending on if solar thermal or solar PV is being analyzed, respectively.

The life cycle emission intensity of [[Hydroelectricity|hydro]], [[wind]] and [[nuclear power]] are lower than solar's as of 2011{{Update inline|date=March 2020|reason=}} as published by the IPCC, and discussed in the article [[Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources]]. Similar to all energy sources where their total life cycle emissions primarily lay in the construction and transportation phase, the switch to [[low carbon power]] in the manufacturing and transportation of solar devices would further reduce carbon emissions. BP Solar owns two factories built by Solarex (one in Maryland, the other in Virginia) in which all of the energy used to manufacture solar panels is produced by solar panels. A 1-kilowatt system eliminates the burning of approximately 170 pounds of coal, 300 pounds of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere, and saves up to {{convert|105|usgal|l|order=flip}} of [[water footprint|water consumption]] monthly.&lt;ref name="Solar Energy Facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portablesolarpanels-forsale.com/solar-energy-facts|title=Portable Solar Panels|work=Portable Solar Panels for Sale|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726034440/http://www.portablesolarpanels-forsale.com/solar-energy-facts/|archive-date=26 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory ([[NREL]]), in harmonizing the disparate estimates of life-cycle GHG emissions for solar PV, found that the most critical parameter was the solar insolation of the site: GHG emissions factors for PV solar are inversely proportional to insolation.&lt;ref&gt;NREL, [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/57187.pdf Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Electricity Generation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328212706/http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/57187.pdf |date=28 March 2015 }}, NREL/FS-6A20-57187, Jan 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; For a site with insolation of 1700 kWh/m2/year, typical of southern Europe, NREL researchers estimated GHG emissions of 45&amp;nbsp;g{{CO2}}e/kWh. Using the same assumptions, at Phoenix, USA, with insolation of 2400&amp;nbsp;kWh/m2/year, the GHG emissions factor would be reduced to 32&amp;nbsp;g of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e/kWh.&lt;ref&gt;David D.

The [[New Zealand]] [[Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment]] found that the solar PV would have little impact on the country's greenhouse gas emissions. The country already generates 80 percent of its electricity from renewable resources (primarily hydroelectricity and geothermal) and national electricity usage peaks on winter evenings whereas solar generation peaks on summer afternoons, meaning a large uptake of solar PV would end up displacing other renewable generators before fossil-fueled power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.pce.parliament.nz/our-work/news-insights/electric-cars-not-solar-panels-says-environment-commissioner |title= Electric cars not solar panels, says Environment Commissioner |publisher= Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment |date= 22 March 2016 |access-date= 23 March 2016 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160403033039/http://www.pce.parliament.nz/our-work/news-insights/electric-cars-not-solar-panels-says-environment-commissioner |archive-date= 3 April 2016 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy payback ===

The [[Crystalline silicon#Energy payback time|energy payback time]] (EPBT) of a power generating system is the time required to generate as much energy as is consumed during production and lifetime operation of the system. Due to improving production technologies the payback time has been decreasing constantly since the introduction of PV systems in the energy market.&lt;ref name=Fraunhofer-PR-2014&gt;{{cite web |title=Photovoltaics Report  |url=http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf  |publisher=Fraunhofer ISE  |pages=28–32  |access-date=31 August 2014  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809192020/http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf  |archive-date=9 August 2014  |date=28 July 2014  |url-status=live  |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2000 the energy payback time of PV systems was estimated as 8 to 11 years&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Blakers and Klaus Weber, [http://www.ecotopia.com/apollo2/pvepbtoz.htm "The Energy Intensity of Photovoltaic Systems"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717213134/http://www.ecotopia.com/apollo2/pvepbtoz.htm |date=17 July 2012 }}, Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems, Australian National University, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2006 this was estimated to be 1.5 to 3.5 years for [[crystalline silicon]] PV systems&lt;ref name="ECN2006"/&gt; and 1–1.5 years for thin film technologies (S. Europe).&lt;ref name="ECN2006"/&gt; These figures fell to 0.75–3.5 years in 2013, with an average of about 2 years for crystalline silicon PV and CIS systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peng | first1 = Jinqing | last2 = Lu | first2 = Lin | last3 = Yang | first3 = Hongxing | year = 2013 | title = Review on lifecycle assessment of energy payback and greenhouse gas emission of solar photovoltaic systems | url = | journal = [[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]] | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 255–274, Fig. 5 | doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2012.11.035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another economic measure, closely related to the energy payback time, is the [[energy returned on energy invested]] (EROEI) or [[energy return on investment]] (EROI),&lt;ref&gt;C. Reich-Weiser, D. Dornfeld, and S. Horne. [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6bt786nf Environmental assessment and metrics for solar: Case study of solfocus solar concentrator systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406021740/http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6bt786nf |date=6 April 2013 }}. UC Berkeley: Laboratory for Manufacturing and Sustainability, 8 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; which is the ratio of electricity generated divided by the energy required to build ''and maintain'' the equipment. (This is not the same as the [[return on investment|economic return on investment]] (ROI), which varies according to local energy prices, subsidies available and metering techniques.)

Czanderna and G.J. Jorgensen, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO.&lt;/ref&gt; the EROEI of PV systems are in the range of 10 to 30, thus generating enough energy over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times (6–31 reproductions) depending on what type of material, [[balance of system]] (BOS), and the geographic location of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Pearce and Andrew Lau, [http://alpha.chem.umb.edu/chemistry/ch471/evans%20files/Net_Energy%20solar%20cells.pdf "Net Energy Analysis For Sustainable Energy Production From Silicon Based Solar Cells"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110915040100/http://alpha.chem.umb.edu/chemistry/ch471/evans%20files/Net_Energy%20solar%20cells.pdf |date=15 September 2011 }}, Proceedings of American Society of Mechanical Engineers Solar 2002: Sunrise on the Reliable Energy Economy, editor [[Rebecca Campbell-Howe|R.

===Water use===
Solar power includes plants with among the lowest water consumption per unit of electricity (photovoltaic), and also power plants with among the highest water consumption (concentrating solar power with wet-cooling systems).

Photovoltaic power plants use very little water for operations. Life-cycle water consumption for utility-scale operations is estimated to be {{convert|12|usgal|l|order=flip|abbr=off}} per megawatt-hour for flat-panel PV solar. Only wind power, which consumes essentially no water during operations, has a lower water consumption intensity.&lt;ref name="iopscience.iop.org"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1088/1748-9326/8/1/015031|title = Life cycle water use for electricity generation: A review and harmonization of literature estimates|journal = Environmental Research Letters|volume = 8|issue = 1|pages = 015031|date = March 2013|last1 = Meldrum|first1 = J.|last2 = Nettles-Anderson|first2 = S.|last3 = Heath|first3 = G.|last4 = MacKnick|first4 = J.|bibcode = 2013ERL.....8a5031M|doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concentrating solar power plants with wet-cooling systems, on the other hand, have the highest water-consumption intensities of any conventional type of electric power plant; only fossil-fuel plants with carbon-capture and storage may have higher water intensities.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Bracken and others, Concentrating Solar Power and Water Issues in the U.S. Southwest, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Technical Report NREL/TP-6A50-61376, March 2015, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study comparing various sources of electricity found that the median water consumption during operations of concentrating solar power plants with wet cooling was {{convert|810|usgal/MWh|m3/MWh|order=flip}} for power tower plants and {{convert|890|usgal/MWh|m3/MWh|order=flip|abbr=on}} for trough plants. This was higher than the operational water consumption (with cooling towers) for nuclear at {{convert|720|usgal/MWh|m3/MWh|order=flip|abbr=on}}, coal at {{convert|530|usgal/MWh|m3/MWh|order=flip|abbr=on}}, or natural gas at {{convert|210|usgal/MWh|m3/MWh|order=flip|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="iopscience.iop.org"/&gt; A 2011 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory came to similar conclusions: for power plants with cooling towers, water consumption during operations was {{convert|865|usgal/MWh|m3/MWh|order=flip|abbr=on}}  for CSP trough, {{convert|786|usgal/MWh|m3/MWh|order=flip|abbr=on}} for CSP tower, {{convert|687|usgal/MWh|m3/MWh|order=flip|abbr=on}} for coal, {{convert|672|usgal/MWh|m3/MWh|order=flip|abbr=on}} for nuclear, and {{convert|198|usgal/MWh|m3/MWh|order=flip|abbr=on}} for natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;John Macknick and others, [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/50900.pdf A Review of Operational Water Consumption and Withdrawal Factors for Electricity Generating Technologies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406000614/http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/50900.pdf |date=6 April 2015 }}, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Technical Report NREL/TP-6A20-50900.&lt;/ref&gt; The Solar Energy Industries Association noted that the Nevada Solar One trough CSP plant consumes {{convert|850|usgal/MWh|m3/MWh|order=flip|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Utility-Scale Solar Power: Responsible Water Resource Management, Solar Energy Industries Association, 18 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of water consumption is heightened because CSP plants are often located in arid environments where water is scarce.

In 2007, the US Congress directed the Department of Energy to report on ways to reduce water consumption by CSP. The subsequent report noted that dry cooling technology was available that, although more expensive to build and operate, could reduce water consumption by CSP by 91 to 95 percent. A hybrid wet/dry cooling system could reduce water consumption by 32 to 58 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/csp_water_study.pdf Concentrating Solar Power Commercial Application Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226021735/https://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/csp_water_study.pdf |date=26 December 2017 }}, US Department of Energy, 20 Feb. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 report by NREL noted that of the 24 operating CSP power plants in the US, 4 used dry cooling systems. The four dry-cooled systems were the three power plants at the [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]] near [[Barstow, California]], and the [[Genesis Solar Energy Project]] in [[Riverside County, California]]. Of 15 CSP projects under construction or development in the US as of March 2015, 6 were wet systems, 7 were dry systems, 1 hybrid, and 1 unspecified.

Although many older thermoelectric power plants with once-through cooling or cooling ponds ''use'' more water than CSP, meaning that more water passes through their systems, most of the cooling water returns to the water body available for other uses, and they ''consume'' less water by evaporation. For instance, the median coal power plant in the US with once-through cooling uses {{convert|36,350|usgal/MWh|m3/MWh|order=flip|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}, but only {{convert|250|usgal/MWh|m3/MWh|order=flip|abbr=on}} (less than one percent) is lost through evaporation.&lt;ref&gt;John Macknick and others, [https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/50900.pdf A Review of Operational Water Consumption and Withdrawal Factors for Electricity Generating Technologies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809222054/http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/50900.pdf |date=9 August 2017 }}, NREL, Technical Report NREL/TP-6A20-50900.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, the majority of US power plants have used recirculating systems such as cooling towers rather than once-through systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=14971 Many newer power plants have cooling systems that Reuse Water] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226020936/https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=14971 |date=26 December 2017 }}, US EIA, 11 Feb. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other issues ===
One issue that has often raised concerns is the use of [[cadmium]] (Cd), a [[toxic heavy metal]] that has the tendency to [[bioaccumulation|accumulate]] in ecological [[food chain]]s. It is used as semiconductor component in [[cadmium telluride solar cell|CdTe solar cells]] and as a buffer layer for certain [[CIGS cell]]s in the form of [[cadmium sulfide]].&lt;ref name="werner"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Werner  |first1=Jürgen H.  |title=Toxic Substances In Photovoltaic Modules  |url=http://www.postfreemarket.net/pdf/japan1.pdf  |website=postfreemarket.net  |publisher=Institute of Photovoltaics, University of Stuttgart, Germany - The 21st International Photovoltaic Science and Engineering Conference 2011 Fukuoka, Japan  |access-date=23 September 2014  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221045847/http://www.postfreemarket.net/pdf/japan1.pdf  |archive-date=21 December 2014  |page=2  |date=2 November 2011  |url-status=dead  |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The amount of cadmium used in [[thin-film solar cell]]s is relatively small (5–10 g/m²) and with proper recycling and emission control techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0.3–0.9 [[microgram]]/kWh over the whole life-cycle.&lt;ref name="ECN2006" /&gt; Most of these emissions arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and coal and [[lignite]] combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium. Life-cycle cadmium emissions from coal is 3.1 microgram/kWh, lignite 6.2, and [[natural gas]] 0.2 microgram/kWh.

In a [[life-cycle analysis]] it has been noted, that if electricity produced by photovoltaic panels were used to manufacture the modules instead of electricity from burning coal, cadmium emissions from coal power usage in the manufacturing process could be entirely eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnl.gov/pv/files/pdf/art_166.pdf|title=CdTe PV: Real and Perceived EHS Risks|author=|date=|website=bnl.gov|access-date=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627012102/https://www.bnl.gov/pv/files/pdf/art_166.pdf|archive-date=27 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[crystalline silicon]] modules, the [[solder]] material, that joins together the copper strings of the cells, contains about 36 percent of [[lead]] (Pb). Moreover, the paste used for screen printing front and back contacts contains traces of Pb and sometimes Cd as well. It is estimated that about 1,000 metric tonnes of Pb have been used for 100 gigawatts of c-Si solar modules.

A 2014-published life-cycle analysis of land use for various sources of electricity concluded that the large-scale implementation of solar and wind potentially reduces pollution-related
environmental impacts. The study found that the land-use footprint, given in square meter-years per megawatt-hour (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;a/MWh), was lowest for wind, natural gas and rooftop PV, with 0.26, 0.49 and 0.59, respectively, and followed by utility-scale solar PV with 7.9. For CSP, the footprint was 9 and 14, using parabolic troughs and solar towers, respectively. The largest footprint had coal-fired power plants with 18&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;a/MWh.&lt;ref&gt;Hertwich and others, [http://www.pnas.org/content/112/20/6277.full.pdf "Integrated life-cycle assessment of electricity-supply scenarios confirms global environmental benefit of low-carbon technologies"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123154831/http://www.pnas.org/content/112/20/6277.full.pdf |date=23 November 2015 }}, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 19 May 2015, v.112 n.20.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concentrator photovoltaics ===
[[File:3 MW CPV project in Golmud, China.jpg|thumb|[[Concentrator photovoltaics|CPV modules]] on dual axis [[solar tracker]]s in Golmud, China]]

[[Concentrator photovoltaics]] (CPV) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for the purpose of [[electrical power production]]. Contrary to conventional photovoltaic systems, it uses [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] and [[curved mirror]]s to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, [[multi-junction solar cells]]. Solar concentrators of all varieties may be used, and these are often mounted on a [[solar tracker]] in order to keep the focal point upon the cell as the sun moves across the sky.&lt;ref&gt;MSU-CSET Participation Archive with notation in the Murray Ledger &amp; Times&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luminescent solar concentrator]]s (when combined with a PV-solar cell) can also be regarded as a CPV system. Concentrated photovoltaics are useful as they can improve efficiency of PV-solar panels drastically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Layton |first = Julia |url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/luminescent-solar-concentrator1.htm |title = What is a luminescent solar concentrator? |publisher = Science.howstuffworks.com |date = 5 November 2008 |access-date = 19 April 2011 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100310165608/http://science.howstuffworks.com/luminescent-solar-concentrator1.htm |archive-date = 10 March 2010 |df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, most [[solar panels on spacecraft]] are also made of high efficient multi-junction photovoltaic cells to derive electricity from sunlight when operating in the [[inner Solar System]].

=== Floatovoltaics ===

[[Floatovoltaics]] are an emerging form of PV systems that float on the surface of irrigation canals, water reservoirs, quarry lakes, and tailing ponds. Several systems exist in France, India, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=SolarServer.com |url=http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/archive-2014/2014/kw36/kyocera-partners-announce-construction-of-the-worlds-largest-floating-solar-pv-plant-in-hyogo-prefecture-japan.html |title=Kyocera, partners announce construction of the world's largest floating solar PV Plant in Hyogo prefecture, Japan |date=4 September 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104333/http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/archive-2014/2014/kw36/kyocera-partners-announce-construction-of-the-worlds-largest-floating-solar-pv-plant-in-hyogo-prefecture-japan.html |archive-date=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=EnergyWorld.com |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/11/running-out-of-precious-land-floating-solar-pv-systems-may-be-a-solution |title=Running Out of Precious Land?
