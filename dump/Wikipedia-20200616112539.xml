'''CRISPR''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|s|p|ər}}) ('''clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats''') is a family of [[DNA]] sequences found in the [[genome]]s of [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] organisms such as [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]].&lt;ref name="pmid25574773" /&gt; These sequences are derived from DNA fragments of [[bacteriophage]]s that had previously infected the prokaryote. They are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar bacteriophages during subsequent infections. Hence these sequences play a key role in the antiviral (i.e. anti-phage) defense system of prokaryotes.&lt;ref name="pmid25574773"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrangou R | authorlink=Rodolphe Barrangou | title = The roles of CRISPR-Cas systems in adaptive immunity and beyond | journal = Current Opinion in Immunology | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 36–41 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25574773 | doi = 10.1016/j.coi.2014.12.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cas9]] (or "CRISPR-associated protein 9") is an [[enzyme]] that uses CRISPR sequences as a guide to recognize and cleave specific strands of DNA that are complementary to the CRISPR sequence. Cas9 enzymes together with CRISPR sequences form the basis of a technology known as [[CRISPR gene editing|CRISPR-Cas9]] that can be used to edit genes within organisms.&lt;ref name="pmid24651067"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang F, Wen Y, Guo X | title = CRISPR/Cas9 for genome editing: progress, implications and challenges | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 23 | issue = R1 | pages = R40–6 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24651067 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddu125 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; This editing process has a wide variety of applications including basic biological research, development of [[biotechnology]] products, and treatment of diseases.&lt;ref&gt;CRISPR-CAS9, TALENS and ZFNS - the battle in gene editing https://www.ptglab.com/news/blog/crispr-cas9-talens-and-zfns-the-battle-in-gene-editing/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hsu2014" /&gt;

== History ==
=== Repeated sequences ===
The discovery of clustered DNA repeats occurred independently in three parts of the world. The first description of what would later be called CRISPR is from [[Osaka University]] researcher [[Yoshizumi Ishino]] and his colleagues in 1987. They accidentally cloned part of a CRISPR sequence together with the "''iap" gene'' ''(isozyme conversion of alkaline phosphatase)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishino Y, Shinagawa H, Makino K, Amemura M, Nakata A | title = Nucleotide sequence of the iap gene, responsible for alkaline phosphatase isozyme conversion in Escherichia coli, and identification of the gene product | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 169 | issue = 12 | pages = 5429–5433 | date = December 1987 | pmid = 3316184 | doi = 10.1128/jb.169.12.5429-5433.1987 | pmc = 213968 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that was their target. The organization of the repeats was unusual. Repeated sequences are typically arranged consecutively, without interspersed different sequences.&lt;ref name="Ishino1987"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishino Y, Shinagawa H, Makino K, Amemura M, Nakata A | title = Nucleotide sequence of the iap gene, responsible for alkaline phosphatase isozyme conversion in Escherichia coli, and identification of the gene product | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 169 | issue = 12 | pages = 5429–5433 | date = December 1987 | pmid = 3316184 | pmc = 213968 | doi = 10.1128/jb.169.12.5429-5433.1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hsu2014" /&gt; They did not know the function of the interrupted clustered repeats.

In 1993, researchers of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' in the Netherlands published two articles about a cluster of interrupted direct repeats (DR) in that bacterium. They recognized the diversity of the sequences that intervened the direct repeats among different strains of ''M. tuberculosis''&lt;ref name="Soolingen1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Soolingen D, de Haas PE, Hermans PW, Groenen PM, van Embden JD | title = Comparison of various repetitive DNA elements as genetic markers for strain differentiation and epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis | journal = Journal of Clinical Microbiology | volume = 31 | issue = 8 | pages = 1987–1995 | date = August 1993 | pmid = 7690367 | pmc = 265684 | doi = 10.1128/JCM.31.8.1987-1995.1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and used this property to design a typing method that was named ''[[wikt:spoligotyping|spoligotyping]]'', which is still in use today.&lt;ref name="Groenen1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Groenen PM, Bunschoten AE, van Soolingen D, van Embden JD | title = Nature of DNA polymorphism in the direct repeat cluster of Mycobacterium tuberculosis; application for strain differentiation by a novel typing method | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 1057–1065 | date = December 1993 | pmid = 7934856 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.1993.tb00976.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mojica2016"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mojica FJ, Montoliu L |title=On the Origin of CRISPR-Cas Technology: From Prokaryotes to Mammals |journal=Trends in Microbiology |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=811–820 |year=2016 |pmid=27401123 |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2016.06.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, repeats were observed in the archaeal organisms of ''[[Haloferax]]'' and ''[[Haloarcula]]'' species, and their function was studied by [[Francisco Mojica]] at the [[University of Alicante]] in Spain. Although his hypothesis turned out to be wrong, Mojica's supervisor surmised at the time that the clustered repeats had a role in correctly segregating replicated DNA into daughter cells during cell division because plasmids and chromosomes with identical repeat arrays could not coexist in ''[[Haloferax volcanii]]''. Transcription of the interrupted repeats was also noted for the first time.&lt;ref name="Mojica2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mojica2016b"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mojica FJ, Rodriguez-Valera F |title=The discovery of CRISPR in archaea and bacteria |journal=The FEBS Journal |volume=283 |issue=17 |pages=3162–3169 |year=2016 |pmid=27234458 |doi=10.1111/febs.13766 |url=http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/57676/2/2016_Mojica_Rodriguez_TheFEBSJournal_accepted.pdf |hdl=10045/57676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, Mojica performed a survey of scientific literature and one of his students performed a search in published genomes with a program devised by himself. They identified interrupted repeats in 20 species of microbes as belonging to the same family.&lt;ref name="Mojica_2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mojica FJ, Díez-Villaseñor C, Soria E, Juez G | title = Biological significance of a family of regularly spaced repeats in the genomes of Archaea, Bacteria and mitochondria | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 244–246 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10760181 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2958.2000.01838.x |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Mojica and [[Ruud Jansen]], who were searching for additional interrupted repeats, proposed the acronym CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) to alleviate the confusion stemming from the numerous acronyms used to describe the sequences in the scientific literature.&lt;ref name="Mojica2016b" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Barrangou | first1 = Rodolphe | authorlink=Rodolphe Barrangou | last2 = van der Oost | first2 = John | name-list-format = vanc | title = CRISPR-Cas Systems : RNA-mediated Adaptive Immunity in Bacteria and Archaea | date = 2013 | publisher = Springer | location = Heidelberg  | isbn = 978-3-642-34656-9 | page = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Tang, et al. showed evidence that CRISPR repeat regions from the genome of ''[[Archaeoglobus fulgidus]]'' were transcribed into long RNA molecules that were subsequently processed into unit-length small RNAs, plus some longer forms of 2, 3, or more spacer-repeat units.&lt;ref name="pmid25994611"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Charpentier E, Richter H, van der Oost J, White MF | title = Biogenesis pathways of RNA guides in archaeal and bacterial CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity | journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 428–441 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25994611 | pmc = 5965381 | doi = 10.1093/femsre/fuv023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CRISPR-associated systems ===
A major addition to the understanding of CRISPR came with Jansen's observation that the prokaryote repeat cluster was accompanied by a set of homologous genes that make up CRISPR-associated systems or ''cas'' genes. Four ''cas'' genes (''cas'' 1–4) were initially recognized. The Cas proteins showed [[helicase]] and [[nuclease]] [[Structural motif|motifs]], suggesting a role in the dynamic structure of the CRISPR loci.&lt;ref name="pmid11952905"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jansen R, Embden JD, Gaastra W, Schouls LM | title = Identification of genes that are associated with DNA repeats in prokaryotes | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 1565–1575 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11952905 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2958.2002.02839.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this publication the acronym CRISPR was used as the universal name of this pattern. However, the CRISPR function remained enigmatic.

The arrangement of the three components is not always as shown.&lt;ref name="pmid20056882"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horvath P, Barrangou R | s2cid=17960960 | authorlink2=Rodolphe Barrangou | title = CRISPR/Cas, the immune system of bacteria and archaea | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5962 | pages = 167–170 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20056882 | doi = 10.1126/Science.1179555 | bibcode = 2010Sci...327..167H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20125085"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marraffini LA, Sontheimer EJ | title = CRISPR interference: RNA-directed adaptive immunity in bacteria and archaea | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 181–190 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20125085 | pmc = 2928866 | doi = 10.1038/nrg2749 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, several CRISPRs with similar sequences can be present in a single genome, only one of which is associated with ''cas'' genes.&lt;ref name="pmid17521438"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grissa I, Vergnaud G, Pourcel C | title = The CRISPRdb database and tools to display CRISPRs and to generate dictionaries of spacers and repeats | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 8 | pages = 172 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17521438 | pmc = 1892036 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-8-172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from [[phage]] DNA and [[extrachromosomal DNA]] such as [[plasmids]].&lt;ref name="pmid15758212"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pourcel C, Salvignol G, Vergnaud G | title = CRISPR elements in Yersinia pestis acquire new repeats by preferential uptake of bacteriophage DNA, and provide additional tools for evolutionary studies | journal = Microbiology | volume = 151 | issue = Pt 3 | pages = 653–663 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15758212 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.27437-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15791728"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mojica FJ, Díez-Villaseñor C, García-Martínez J, Soria E | s2cid = 27481111 | title = Intervening sequences of regularly spaced prokaryotic repeats derive from foreign genetic elements | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 174–182 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15791728 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s00239-004-0046-3 | bibcode = 2005JMolE..60..174M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16079334"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bolotin A, Quinquis B, Sorokin A, Ehrlich SD | title = Clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats (CRISPRs) have spacers of extrachromosomal origin | journal = Microbiology | volume = 151 | issue = Pt 8 | pages = 2551–2561 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16079334 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.28048-0 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that previously tried to attack the cell. The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR/''cas'' system could have a role in adaptive immunity in [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="pmid20056882" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25963251"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morange M | title = What history tells us XXXVII.

The first publication&lt;ref name="pmid15791728" /&gt; proposing a role of CRISPR-Cas in microbial immunity, by the researchers at the [[University of Alicante]], predicted a role for the RNA transcript of spacers on target recognition in a mechanism that could be analogous to the [[RNA interference]] system used by eukaryotic cells. Koonin and colleagues extended this RNA interference hypothesis by proposing mechanisms of action for the different CRISPR-Cas subtypes according to the predicted function of their proteins.&lt;ref name="Makarova2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Makarova KS, Grishin NV, Shabalina SA, Wolf YI, Koonin EV | authorlink5=Eugene Koonin | title = A putative RNA-interference-based immune system in prokaryotes: computational analysis of the predicted enzymatic machinery, functional analogies with eukaryotic RNAi, and hypothetical mechanisms of action | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 1 | issue =  | pages = 7 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16545108 | pmc = 1462988 | doi = 10.1186/1745-6150-1-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental work by several groups revealed the basic mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas immunity.

Cas12a showed several key differences from Cas9 including: causing a 'staggered' cut in double stranded DNA as opposed to the 'blunt' cut produced by Cas9, relying on a 'T rich' [[Protospacer adjacent motif|PAM]] (providing alternative targeting sites to Cas9) and requiring only a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) for successful targeting. By contrast Cas9 requires both crRNA and a [[Trans-activating crRNA|transactivating crRNA]] (tracrRNA).

These differences may give Cas12a some advantages over Cas9. For example, Cas12a's small crRNAs are ideal for multiplexed genome editing, as more of them can be packaged in one vector than can Cas9's sgRNAs. As well, the sticky 5′ overhangs left by Cas12a can be used for DNA assembly that is much more target-specific than traditional Restriction Enzyme cloning.&lt;ref name="PMC5316869"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim H, Kim ST, Ryu J, Kang BC, Kim JS, and Kim SG | title = CRISPR/Cpf1-mediated DNA-free plant genome editing | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 8 | issue = 14406 | pages = 14406 | date = February 2017 | pmc = 5316869 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms14406 | pmid=28205546| bibcode = 2017NatCo...814406K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Cas12a cleaves DNA 18–23 base pairs downstream from the PAM site. This means there is no disruption to the recognition sequence after repair, and so Cas12a enables multiple rounds of DNA cleavage. By contrast, since Cas9 cuts only 3 base pairs upstream of the PAM site, the NHEJ pathway results in [[Indel|indel]] mutations which destroy the recognition sequence, thereby preventing further rounds of cutting. In theory, repeated rounds of DNA cleavage should cause an increased opportunity for the desired genomic editing to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Cpf1 Nuclease|url = https://www.abmgood.com/marketing/knowledge_base/CRISPR_Cas9_Introduction_Part7.php#ATSPC|website = abmgood.com|accessdate = 2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cas genes and CRISPR subtypes ===
Small clusters of ''cas'' genes are often located next to CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Collectively the 93 ''cas'' genes are grouped into 35 families based on sequence similarity of the encoded proteins. 11 of the 35 families form the ''cas'' core, which includes the protein families Cas1 through Cas9. A complete CRISPR-Cas locus has at least one gene belonging to the ''cas'' core.&lt;ref name="Makarova2015" /&gt;

CRISPR-Cas systems fall into two classes. Class 1 systems use a complex of multiple Cas proteins to degrade foreign nucleic acids. Class 2 systems use a single large Cas protein for the same purpose. Class 1 is divided into types I, III, and IV; class 2 is divided into types II, V, and VI.&lt;ref name="Wright2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright AV, Nuñez JK, Doudna JA | authorlink3=Jennifer Doudna | title = Biology and Applications of CRISPR Systems: Harnessing Nature's Toolbox for Genome Engineering | journal = Cell | volume = 164 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 29–44 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26771484 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.12.035 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 6 system types are divided into 19 subtypes.&lt;ref name="Westra2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Westra | first1 = Edze R. | last2 = Dowling | first2 = Andrea J. | last3 = Broniewski | first3 = Jenny M. | last4 = van Houte | first4 = Stineke | name-list-format = vanc | title = Evolution and Ecology of CRISPR | journal = Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | date = November 2016 | volume = 47 | issue = 1 |pages = 307–331 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-121415-032428 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each type and most subtypes are characterized by a "signature gene" found almost exclusively in the category.

== Mechanism ==
[[File:The Stages of CRISPR immunity.svg|thumb|The stages of CRISPR immunity for each of the three major types of adaptive immunity. (1) Acquisition begins by recognition of invading DNA by [[Cas1]] and Cas2 and cleavage of a protospacer. (2) The protospacer is ligated to the direct repeat adjacent to the leader sequence and (3) single strand extension repairs the CRISPR and duplicates the direct repeat. The crRNA processing and interference stages occur differently in each of the three major CRISPR systems. (4) The primary CRISPR transcript is cleaved by cas genes to produce crRNAs. (5) In type I systems Cas6e/Cas6f cleave at the junction of ssRNA and dsRNA formed by hairpin loops in the direct repeat. Type II systems use a trans-activating (tracr) RNA to form dsRNA, which is cleaved by [[Cas9]] and RNaseIII. Type III systems use a Cas6 homolog that does not require hairpin loops in the direct repeat for cleavage. (6) In type II and type III systems secondary trimming is performed at either the 5’ or 3’ end to produce mature crRNAs. (7) Mature crRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form interference complexes. (8) In type I and type II systems, interactions between the protein and PAM sequence are required for degradation of invading DNA. Type III systems do not require a PAM for successful degradation and in type III-A systems basepairing occurs between the crRNA and mRNA rather than the DNA, targeted by type III-B systems.]]

CRISPR-Cas immunity is a natural process of bacteria and archaea. CRISPR-Cas prevents bacteriophage infection, [[conjugation (genetics)|conjugation]] and [[transformation (genetics)#Natural transformation|natural transformation]] by degrading foreign nucleic acids that enter the cell.&lt;ref name="Marraffini2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marraffini LA | s2cid = 3718361 | title = CRISPR-Cas immunity in prokaryotes | journal = Nature | volume = 526 | issue = 7571 | pages = 55–61 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26432244 | doi = 10.1038/nature15386 | bibcode = 2015Natur.526...55M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spacer acquisition ===
When a [[microbe]] is invaded by a [[bacteriophage]], the first stage of the immune response is to capture phage DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. [[Cas1]] and Cas2 are found in both types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of [[cas1]] or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.&lt;ref name="pmid19120484"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aliyari R, Ding SW | title = RNA-based viral immunity initiated by the Dicer family of host immune receptors | journal = Immunological Reviews | volume = 227 | issue = 1 | pages = 176–188 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19120484 | pmc = 2676720 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00722.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23696746"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dugar G, Herbig A, Förstner KU, Heidrich N, Reinhardt R, Nieselt K, Sharma CM | title = High-resolution transcriptome maps reveal strain-specific regulatory features of multiple Campylobacter jejuni isolates | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = e1003495 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23696746 | pmc = 3656092 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003495 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22160698"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hatoum-Aslan A, Maniv I, Marraffini LA | title = Mature clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats RNA (crRNA) length is measured by a ruler mechanism anchored at the precursor processing site | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 52 | pages = 21218–21222 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22160698 | pmc = 3248500 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1112832108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10821218H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22402487"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yosef I, Goren MG, Qimron U | title = Proteins and DNA elements essential for the CRISPR adaptation process in ''Escherichia coli'' | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 40 | issue = 12 | pages = 5569–5576 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22402487 | pmc = 3384332 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gks216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22558257"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swarts DC, Mosterd C, van Passel MW, Brouns SJ | title = CRISPR interference directs strand specific spacer acquisition | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = e35888 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22558257 | pmc = 3338789 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035888 | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...735888S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nt of the protospacer.

However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.&lt;ref name="pmid23403393" /&gt; It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition.

==== Insertion variants ====
Analysis of ''[[Sulfolobus solfataricus]]'' CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion, as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.&lt;ref name="pmid22834906" /&gt;

Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was discovered in the type I-E system of ''E. coli''. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This ‘priming’ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the priming spacer.&lt;ref name="pmid22558257" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22771574" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22781758" /&gt; This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.&lt;ref name="pmid22781758" /&gt;

=== Biogenesis ===
CRISPR-RNA (crRNA), which later guides the Cas nuclease to the target during the interference step, must be generated from the CRISPR sequence. The crRNA is initially transcribed as part of a single long transcript encompassing much of the CRISPR array.&lt;ref name="pmid20125085" /&gt; This transcript is then cleaved by Cas proteins to form crRNAs. The mechanism to produce crRNAs differs among CRISPR/Cas systems. In type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops&lt;ref name="pmid21572444"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gesner EM, Schellenberg MJ, Garside EL, George MM, Macmillan AM | s2cid = 677704 | title = Recognition and maturation of effector RNAs in a CRISPR interference pathway | journal = Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 688–692 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21572444 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb.2042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21572442"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sashital DG, Jinek M, Doudna JA | s2cid=5538195 | authorlink3=Jennifer Doudna | title = An RNA-induced conformational change required for CRISPR RNA cleavage by the endoribonuclease Cse3 | journal = Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 680–687 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21572442 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb.2043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20829488"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haurwitz RE, Jinek M, Wiedenheft B, Zhou K, Doudna JA | authorlink5=Jennifer Doudna | title = Sequence- and structure-specific RNA processing by a CRISPR endonuclease | journal = Science | volume = 329 | issue = 5997 | pages = 1355–1358 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20829488 | pmc = 3133607 | doi = 10.1126/science.1192272 | bibcode = 2010Sci...329.1355H }}&lt;/ref&gt; created by the pairing of identical repeats that flank the crRNA.&lt;ref name="pmid17442114"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kunin V, Sorek R, Hugenholtz P | title = Evolutionary conservation of sequence and secondary structures in CRISPR repeats | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = R61 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17442114 | pmc = 1896005 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2007-8-4-r61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These Cas proteins cleave the longer transcript at the edge of the paired region, leaving a single crRNA along with a small remnant of the paired repeat region.

Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a [[trans-activating crRNA]] (tracrRNA).&lt;ref name="Deltcheva2011"/&gt; Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer, which is instead truncated at one end.&lt;ref name="pmid22949671" /&gt;

CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids.

=== Interference ===
During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.

Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, [[Cas9]], for the interference step.&lt;ref name="pmid22949671" /&gt; [[Cas9]] requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is required in type II systems. However, the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).

Type III systems, like type I require six or seven Cas proteins binding to crRNAs.&lt;ref name="pmid22227115"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang J, Rouillon C, Kerou M, Reeks J, Brugger K, Graham S, Reimann J, Cannone G, Liu H, Albers SV, Naismith JH, Spagnolo L, White MF | title = Structure and mechanism of the CMR complex for CRISPR-mediated antiviral immunity | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–313 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22227115 | pmc = 3381847 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2011.12.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19945378"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hale CR, Zhao P, Olson S, Duff MO, Graveley BR, Wells L, Terns RM, Terns MP | title = RNA-guided RNA cleavage by a CRISPR RNA-Cas protein complex | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 5 | pages = 945–956 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19945378 | pmc = 2951265 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.07.040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The type III systems analysed from ''S. solfataricus'' and ''P. furiosus'' both target the mRNA of phages rather than phage DNA genome,&lt;ref name="pmid23320564" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19945378" /&gt; which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.&lt;ref name="pmid22337052" /&gt; Type III systems were also found to target DNA in addition to RNA using a different Cas protein in the complex, Cas10.&lt;ref name="Estrella 2016"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Estrella MA, Kuo FT, Bailey S| doi = 10.1101/gad.273722.115| title =RNA-activated DNA cleavage by the Type III-B CRISPR–Cas effector complex| journal = [[Genes and Development]] | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 460–470 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26848046| pmc = 4762430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA cleavage was shown to be transcription dependent.&lt;ref name="Samai 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Samai P, Pyenson N, Jiang W, Goldberg GW, Hatoum-Aslan A, Marraffini LA| doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.04.027| title =Co-transcriptional DNA and RNA Cleavage during Type III CRISPR-Cas Immunity| journal = Cell | volume = 161 | issue = 5 | pages = 1164–1174 | year = 2015 | pmid =25959775| pmc = 4594840 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.&lt;ref name="pmid20072129"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marraffini LA, Sontheimer EJ | title = Self versus non-self discrimination during CRISPR RNA-directed immunity | journal = Nature | volume = 463 | issue = 7280 | pages = 568–571 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20072129 | pmc = 2813891 | doi = 10.1038/nature08703 | bibcode = 2010Natur.463..568M }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as [[Restriction enzyme#Type V|type V restriction enzymes]].

The cas genes in the adaptor and effector modules of the CRISPR-Cas system are believed to have evolved from two different ancestral modules.

CRISPR/Cas can immunize bacteria against certain phages and thus halt transmission.

=== Coevolution ===
Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed [[coevolution]] of host and viral genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heidelberg JF, Nelson WC, Schoenfeld T, Bhaya D | title = Germ warfare in a microbial mat community: CRISPRs provide insights into the co-evolution of host and viral genomes | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = e4169 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19132092 | pmc = 2612747 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004169 | bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.4169H | editor1-last = Ahmed | editor1-first = Niyaz }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in [[pathogen]]ic and [[commensal]] bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, ''[[Francisella novicida]]'' uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial [[lipoprotein]] that is critical for ''F. novicida'' to dampen host response and promote virulence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sampson TR, Saroj SD, Llewellyn AC, Tzeng YL, Weiss DS | title = A CRISPR/Cas system mediates bacterial innate immune evasion and virulence | journal = Nature | volume = 497 | issue = 7448 | pages = 254–257 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23584588 | pmc = 3651764 | doi = 10.1038/nature12048 | bibcode = 2013Natur.497..254S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic model of CRISPR evolution is newly incorporated spacers driving phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacterial immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To resist a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer.&lt;ref name="pmid20072129" /&gt; Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain remains phage sensitive.&lt;ref name="pmid18065545" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20072129" /&gt;

=== Rates ===
A study of 124 ''S. thermophilus'' strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of spacer acquisition.&lt;ref name="pmid18065539" /&gt; Some CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A [[Comparative genomics|comparative genomic]] analysis showed that ''E. coli'' and ''[[Salmonella enterica|S. enterica]]'' evolve much more slowly than ''S. thermophilus''. The latter's strains that diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.&lt;ref name="pmid20559554"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Touchon M, Rocha EP | title = The small, slow and specialized CRISPR and anti-CRISPR of Escherichia and Salmonella | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = e11126 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20559554 | pmc = 2886076 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0011126 | editor1-last = Randau | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...511126T | editor1-first = Lennart }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[metagenomics|Metagenomic]] analysis of two acid-mine-drainage [[biofilm]]s showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions versus the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community than the other.&lt;ref name="pmid17894817" /&gt; In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7–22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% were shared across individuals.&lt;ref name="pmid21149389" /&gt;

From the same environment a single strain was tracked using [[PCR]] primers specific to its CRISPR system. Broad-level results of spacer presence/absence showed significant diversity. However, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,&lt;ref name="pmid21149389" /&gt; suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly.

CRISPRs were analysed from the metagenomes produced for the [[human microbiome project]].&lt;ref name="pmid22719260"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rho M, Wu YW, Tang H, Doak TG, Ye Y | title = Diverse CRISPRs evolving in human microbiomes | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1002441 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22719260 | pmc = 3374615 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002441 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most were body-site specific, some within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these loci originated from [[streptococcal]] species and contained ≈15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some showed little evolution over time.&lt;ref name="pmid22719260" /&gt;

CRISPR evolution was studied in [[chemostat]]s using ''S. thermophilus'' to directly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, ''S. thermophilus'' strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.&lt;ref name="pmid23057534"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sun CL, Barrangou R, Thomas BC, Horvath P, Fremaux C, Banfield JF | authorlink2=Rodolphe Barrangou | title = Phage mutations in response to CRISPR diversification in a bacterial population | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 463–470 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23057534 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02879.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same interval the phage developed [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s that became fixed in the population, suggesting that targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.&lt;ref name="pmid23057534" /&gt;

Another ''S. thermophilus'' experiment showed that phages can infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer. Yet another showed that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.&lt;ref name="pmid24586036"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuno S, Sako Y, Yoshida T | title = Diversification of CRISPR within coexisting genotypes in a natural population of the bloom-forming cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa | journal = Microbiology | volume = 160 | issue = Pt 5 | pages = 903–916 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24586036 | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.073494-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.

== Identification ==
CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea&lt;ref name="pmid24728998" /&gt; and show some sequence similarities.&lt;ref name="pmid17442114" /&gt; Their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats.

Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble, due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms.

The alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read.

== Use by phages ==
Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having [[genomic island|chromosomal islands]]. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.&lt;ref name="pmid20634809"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Novick RP, Christie GE, Penadés JR | title = The phage-related chromosomal islands of Gram-positive bacteria | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 541–551 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20634809 | pmc = 3522866 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro2393 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PICIs are induced, excised, replicated and finally packaged into small capsids by certain staphylococcal temperate phages. PICIs use several mechanisms to block phage reproduction. In first mechanism PICI-encoded Ppi differentially blocks phage maturation by binding or interacting specifically with phage TerS, hence blocks phage TerS/TerL complex  formation responsible for phage DNA packaging. In second mechanism PICI CpmAB redirect the phage capsid morphogenetic protein to make 95% of SaPI-sized capsid and phage DNA can package only 1/3rd of their genome in these small capsid and hence become nonviable phage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ram G, Chen J, Kumar K, Ross HF, Ubeda C, Damle PK, Lane KD, Penadés JR, Christie GE, Novick RP|date=October 2012|title=Staphylococcal pathogenicity island interference with helper phage reproduction is a paradigm of molecular parasitism|url=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=109|issue=40|pages=16300–16305|doi=10.1073/pnas.1204615109|pmc=3479557|pmid=22991467|bibcode=2012PNAS..10916300R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third mechanism involves two proteins, PtiA and PtiB, that target the LtrC, which is responsible for the production of virion and lysis proteins. This interference mechanism is modulated by a modulatory protein, PtiM, binds to one of the interference-mediating proteins, PtiA, and hence achieving the required level of interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ram G, Chen J, Ross HF, Novick RP|date=October 2014|title=Precisely modulated pathogenicity island interference with late phage gene transcription|url=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=111|issue=40|pages=14536–14541|doi=10.1073/pnas.1406749111|pmc=4209980|pmid=25246539|bibcode=2014PNAS..11114536R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' [[serogroup]] O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a ''V. cholera'' PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the I-F system found in ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.&lt;ref name="pmid23446421"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seed KD, Lazinski DW, Calderwood SB, Camilli A | title = A bacteriophage encodes its own CRISPR/Cas adaptive response to evade host innate immunity | journal = Nature | volume = 494 | issue = 7438 | pages = 489–491 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23446421 | pmc = 3587790 | doi = 10.1038/nature11927 | bibcode = 2013Natur.494..489S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain archaeal viruses were shown to carry mini-CRISPR arrays containing one or two spacers. It has been shown that spacers within the virus-borne CRISPR arrays target other viruses and plasmids, suggesting that mini-CRISPR arrays represent a mechanism of heterotypic superinfection exclusion and participate in interviral conflicts.&lt;ref name="pmid31729390" /&gt;

== Applications ==

=== CRISPR gene editing ===
{{main|CRISPR gene editing}}
CRISPR technology has been applied in the food and farming industries to engineer probiotic cultures and to immunize industrial cultures (for yogurt, for instance) versus infections. It is also being used in crops to enhance yield, drought tolerance and nutritional homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.livescience.tech/2018/04/30/what-is-crispr-how-does-it-work-is-it-gene-editing/|title=What is CRISPR and How does it work?|website=Livescience.Tech|access-date=2019-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2014 some 1000 research papers had been published that mentioned CRISPR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Doudna JA, Charpentier E | s2cid=6299381 | authorlink=Jennifer Doudna | title = Genome editing.

In July 2019, CRISPR was used to experimentally treat a patient with a genetic disorder. The patient was a 34-year-old woman with sickle cell disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/07/29/744826505/sickle-cell-patient-reveals-why-she-is-volunteering-for-landmark-gene-editing-st |title=In A 1st, Doctors In U.S. Use CRISPR Tool To Treat Patient With Genetic Disorder |website=NPR.org |access-date=2019-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2020, CRISPR-modified virus was injected into a patient's eye in an attempt to treat [[Leber congenital amaurosis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/04/811461486/in-a-1st-scientists-use-revolutionary-gene-editing-tool-to-edit-inside-a-patient In A 1st, Scientists Use Revolutionary Gene-Editing Tool To Edit Inside A Patient]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the future, CRISPR gene editing could potentially be used to create new species or revive extinct species from closely related ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://the-crispr.com/listen-radiolab-crispr-podcast/|title=Listen Radiolab CRISPR podcast|last=The-Crispr|date=2019-07-15|website=The Crispr|access-date=2019-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRISPR-based re-evaluations of claims for gene-disease relationships have led to the discovery of potentially important anomalies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature.2017.21763 |title=CRISPR studies muddy results of older gene research |journal=Nature |year=2017 |last1=Ledford |first1=Heidi | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CRISPR as diagnostic tool ===
CRISPR associated nucleases have shown to be useful as a tool for molecular testing due to their ability to specifically target nucleic acid sequences in a high background of non-target sequences. In 2016, the Cas9 nuclease was used to deplete unwanted nucleotide sequences in next-generation sequencing libraries while requiring only 250 pg of initial RNA input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gu W, Crawford ED, O'Donovan BD, Wilson MR, Chow ED, Retallack H, DeRisi JL | title = Depletion of Abundant Sequences by Hybridization (DASH): using Cas9 to remove unwanted high-abundance species in sequencing libraries and molecular counting applications | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 41 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26944702 | pmc = 4778327 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-016-0904-5  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in 2017, CRISPR associated nucleases were also used for direct diagnostic testing, down to single molecule sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gootenberg JS, Abudayyeh OO, Lee JW, Essletzbichler P, Dy AJ, Joung J, Verdine V, Donghia N, Daringer NM, Freije CA, Myhrvold C, Bhattacharyya RP, Livny J, Regev A, Koonin EV, Hung DT, Sabeti PC, Collins JJ, Zhang F | display-authors = 6 | title = Nucleic acid detection with CRISPR-Cas13a/C2c2 | journal = Science | volume = 356 | issue = 6336 | pages = 438–442 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28408723 | pmc = 5526198 | doi = 10.1126/science.aam9321 | bibcode = 2017Sci...356..438G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen JS, Ma E, Harrington LB, Da Costa M, Tian X, Palefsky JM, Doudna JA | title = CRISPR-Cas12a target binding unleashes indiscriminate single-stranded DNase activity | journal = Science | volume = 360 | issue = 6387 | pages = 436–439 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29449511 | pmc = 6628903 | doi = 10.1126/science.aar6245 | bibcode = 2018Sci...360..436C }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019, some new diagnostic applications using CRISPR technology, an electrical CRISPR-Chip&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hajian R, Balderston S, Tran T, deBoer T, Etienne J, Sandhu M, Wauford NA, Chung JY, Nokes J, Athaiya M, Paredes J, Peytavi R, Goldsmith B, Murthy N, Conboy IM, Aran K | display-authors = 6 | title = Detection of unamplified target genes via CRISPR-Cas9 immobilized on a graphene field-effect transistor | journal = Nature Biomedical Engineering | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 427–437 | date = June 2019 | pmid = 31097816 | pmc = 6556128 | doi = 10.1038/s41551-019-0371-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the detection of genetic mutations and a microfluidic CRISPR-Biosensor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bruch R, Baaske J, Chatelle C, Meirich M, Madlener S, Weber W, Dincer C, Urban GA | display-authors = 6 | title = CRISPR/Cas13a-Powered Electrochemical Microfluidic Biosensor for Nucleic Acid Amplification-Free miRNA Diagnostics | journal = Advanced Materials | volume = 31 | issue = 51 | pages = e1905311 | date = December 2019 | pmid = 31663165 | doi = 10.1002/adma.201905311 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; for electrochemical miRNA diagnostics, were introduced.
