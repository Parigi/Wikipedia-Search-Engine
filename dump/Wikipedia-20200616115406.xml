'''Goldfinger''' is an American [[punk rock]] and [[ska punk]] band from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], formed in 1994. In their early years the band is widely considered to have been a contributor to the movement of [[Ska#Third wave|third-wave ska]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluebeat.com/music-genre/artist/415 |title=Third Wave Ska Revival: Artists - BlueBeat.com: Play Free Music |publisher=BlueBeat.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Prato |first=Greg |url={{Allmusic|class=artist |id=p39089 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Goldfinger |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; a mid-1990s revitalization in the popularity of [[ska]].  However, the releases of ''[[Open Your Eyes (Goldfinger album)|Open Your Eyes]]'' and ''[[Disconnection Notice]]'' saw the band shed most of the ska influence, and they have been more commonly placed in the [[punk rock]] genre in later years. Apart from the band's music, Goldfinger is also noted for their political activism, particularly in the area of [[animal rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peta2.com/outthere/o-gfinger2.asp |title=PETA2 // Out There // PETA2 agents talk about Goldfinger’s new album and concert tour |publisher=Peta2.com |date=2002-06-02 |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Formation, ''Goldfinger'', and ''Hang-Ups'' (1994–1998)===
Goldfinger was formed by former [[Electric Love Hogs]] member [[John Feldmann]] on vocals and guitar, Simon Williams on bass, former drummer of Buffalo NY's [[Zero Tolerance (band)|Zero Tolerance]] [[Darrin Pfeiffer]] on drums, and Charlie Paulson on guitar. At the time the band was formed, Feldmann and Williams were working at the same [[shoe]] store where they were discovered by A&amp;R Executive [[Patrick McDowell]].&lt;ref name="mtv.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/goldfinger/artist.jhtml#biographyEnd |title=Goldfinger &amp;#124; Music Videos, News, Photos, Tour Dates, Ringtones, and Lyrics |publisher=MTV |date= |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before they were signed to a major label, they released an EP titled ''[https://www.discogs.com/Goldfinger-Richter/release/1353993 Richter]'' on the independent label [[Mojo Records]], which received favorable reviews and a substantial amount of airplay on college radio, leading to Goldfinger and Mojo signing a major-label contract with [[Universal Records]].&lt;ref name="mtv.com"/&gt;

Many of the songs on ''Richter'' are demo versions of songs on the band's full-length debut, ''[[Goldfinger (album)|Goldfinger]]'', which was produced by [[Jay Rifkin]] and released by Mojo Records on February 29, 1996. The song "Here in Your Bedroom" from the album was especially popular and helped the band gain a solid fanbase. In 2006, ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' listed the self-titled Goldfinger album as one of the "10 Albums That Shaped 1996" alongside [[No Doubt]], [[Weezer]] and others.  The band released its second album, ''[[Hang-Ups]]'', on September 9, 1997. Founding bassist Simon Williams left the band following ''[[Hang-Ups]].''  During this time, Goldfinger released a popular cover of the song "[[More Today Than Yesterday]]" by [[Spiral Starecase]], which also helped the band stay out of obscurity.&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"/&gt;

===''Darrin's Coconut Ass: Live from Omaha'', ''Stomping Ground'', and ''Open Your Eyes'' (1999–2004)===
On November 9, 1999 Goldfinger released ''Darrin's Coconut Ass: Live from Omaha'', a collection of 8 cover songs from the band.  Goldfinger's third studio LP was ''[[Stomping Ground]]'', which was released on March 28, 2000. The album sold poorly in the US but was a modest hit in some European countries, thanks to their cover of [[Nena]]'s "[[99 Luftballons]]" sung partly in [[German language|German]]. In 2000, during their tour of England, Goldfinger recorded one of their sets, issuing the live ''Foot in Mouth'', available only at shows and through the band's official website. In 2001, Goldfinger announced that Charlie Paulson was leaving the band and was being replaced by former [[Ünloco]] member, Brian Arthur.&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"/&gt; Their next album, ''[[Open Your Eyes (Goldfinger album)|Open Your Eyes]]'' (2002), was the first for their new record label, '''Jive/Zomba'''.  On this album, the band abandoned much of its [[ska]] influences in favor of a more heavy sound.  Furthermore, some of the lyrics discussed animal rights, a subject which had not been touched upon in earlier albums.  The band recorded a [[music video]] for the title track of the album, which was also focused on animal rights.

===''Disconnection Notice'' and return of Charlie Paulson (2005–2006)===
[[File:Goldfinger live 2006.jpg|thumb|Goldfinger live in 2006.]]
In early 2005, they released its first album for their new label, Maverick Records, titled ''[[Disconnection Notice]]''. The song "Wasted" from the album was released as a single. The CD was less well received compared to former Goldfinger albums. In 2005, Brian departed from the band after the release of the album. Shortly after Brians departure, Goldfinger announced that their original guitarist Charlie Paulson would return.  Charlie returned to the stage playing three songs at the Key Club in LA when the band finished a Western USA tour.

===''Hello Destiny...'' (2007–2010)===
Goldfinger signed to the independent record label [[Side One Dummy]] in 2007. On April 22, 2008, the band released their sixth full-length record called ''[[Hello Destiny...]]''. To promote the album, the band embarked on a successful North American tour with [[Less Than Jake]] in summer of 2008. They also played in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]] on August 22&amp;ndash;23, 2008.

Recently, frontman John Feldmann has produced records for [[Mest]], [[The Used]] (whose vocalist [[Bert McCracken]] sang some guest vocals on "Open Your Eyes", "Woodchuck", "Ocean Size", and "Handjobs for Jesus"), [[Hilary Duff]] and [[Story of the Year]].  He also produced [[Good Charlotte]]'s single "The Anthem" (whose guitarist [[Benji Madden]] provides guest vocals on "January", which was originally named "Oracle of Elcaro"). He also signed the band [[Ünloco]] with Maverick Records.

In November 2010, Goldfinger played a handful of shows on a small, west coast tour with [[Reel Big Fish]]. These shows are notable for a couple of reasons: these are the first shows performed without [[Darrin Pfeiffer]] on drums. Drumming duties were handled by [[Branden Steineckert]] of [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]]. Also, on the [[Los Angeles]] show at the [[House of Blues]], original bassist, Simon Williams came out to perform several songs off their classic first album. This was the first time Williams had performed with the band in over a decade. He played the Las Vegas show as well.

===''The Knife'' (2010–present)===
In the November/December 2010 issue No.&amp;nbsp;43 of SMASH magazine, Feldmann stated that a new EP or a possible full-length album was "in the works" with Feldmann having penned 4/5 new tracks, and Pfeiffer having recorded the drum tracks. Feldmann also states in the article that with the release of any new material would be supported with an extended tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smashmagazine.com/issue43-cover-story.html |title=Issue 43 Cover Story - Goldfinger |magazine=SMASH Magazine |accessdate=2011-07-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716093403/http://www.smashmagazine.com/issue43-cover-story.html |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Feldmann, Goldfinger was expecting to have their new album out sometime in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/45686 |title=Goldfinger to release new album this year |publisher=Punknews.org |date=2012-01-03 |accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band released a new song, "Am I Deaf", on Friday May 24, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/goldfingermusic-1/am-i-deaf|title=AM I DEAF|website=Soundcloud.com|accessdate=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Feldmann did an interview with [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]], noting that the band's future largely amounts to the occasional tour: "We'll probably release a song or two but I don't know if we're going to release albums anymore. We play the same songs we've always done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Catching Up with Goldfinger: "Superman" John Feldmann Spills All|date=June 29, 2015|last=Sherman|first=Maria|url=http://www.fuse.tv/2015/06/goldfinger-john-feldmann-interview|publisher=[[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]]|accessdate=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 2017, the group released ''The Knife'', the band's first album featuring [[Mike Herrera]], [[Travis Barker]], and [[Philip Sneed]] (Moon Valjean). Darrin, Kelly, and Charlie left the band prior to its release. Darrin Pfeiffer left the band due to personality conflicts with Feldmann. Darrin spoke about some of the conflicts with Feldmann on an episode of Mike Herrera's podcast. Kelly Lemieux currently tours with Buckcherry, along with other bands and has cited that for his reasoning behind not being an active participant with Goldfinger. Charlie Paulson did rejoin the band on stage for the 2019 Back to the Beach festival and Vans Warped Tour 25th Anniversary. Paulson has since rejoined the band as he has played with them in all their recent shows as well as joining them on their "Fueling The fire" tour with [[Less Than Jake]] in September 2019. The band's live lineup generally consists of Feldmann, Paulson, Herrerra and Sneed, with Barker occasionally playing live shows and other friends of Feldmann playing drums. Other musicians fill-in on guitar and bass when Paulson, Sneed, and Herrerra are not present at shows as well. Their live shows often feature horn players from numerous other ska bands, including Ruben Durazo, Matt Appleton, Billy Kottage, and numerous others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dickman|first1=Maggie|title=Goldfinger announce first new album in nine years, ‘The Knife’—listen to the first single|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/goldfinger_new_album_the_knife|website=[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]|accessdate=21 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170721071951/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/goldfinger_new_album_the_knife|archivedate=21 July 2017|date=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hughes|first1=Josiah|title=Goldfinger's New Album Is Full of Pop-Punk Superstars|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/goldfingers_new_album_is_full_of_pop-punk_superstars|website=Exclaim!|accessdate=21 July 2017|date=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal rights==
Since the band began, Feldmann became a [[vegan]] and [[animal rights]] supporter, as can be seen briefly in the music video for "Open Your Eyes". They also donated the song "What Gives You The Right" to the [[Southern Animal Rights Coalition]] benefit CD, "Until Every Cage Is Empty",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animalrightsmerchandise.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=9 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210171945/http://www.animalrightsmerchandise.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=9 |archivedate=2007-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as writing the song "Free Kevin Kjonaas", an animal rights activist in prison, known as the most involved individual in the [[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty#SHAC 7|SHAC 7]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supportkevin.com/ |title=Support Kevin Kjonaas and the SHAC 7 |publisher=Supportkevin.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/goldfinger4kevin |title=Goldfinger4Kevin |publisher=MySpace.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the songs, "FTN", harshly criticizes [[Ted Nugent]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]] for their hunting tactics and fur fashion, respectively. He also advocates and supports the [[Animal Liberation Front]].&lt;ref name=Keith&gt;Keith, Shannon. ''Behind the Mask'', Uncaged Films, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the song "Behind the Mask" from the album ''[[Disconnection Notice]]'', Feldmann convinced [[PETA]] president and co-founder [[Ingrid Newkirk]] to allow him to sample one of her speeches on animal cruelty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/goldfinger/bio.jhtml |title=Goldfinger Bio|accessdate=October 9, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216052237/http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/goldfinger/bio.jhtml |archivedate=February 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
