'''Paul Gardner Allen''' (January 21, 1953 – October 15, 2018) was an American [[business magnate]], researcher, investor, and philanthropist. He was best known for co-founding [[Microsoft Corporation]] with childhood friend [[Bill Gates]] in 1975, which helped spark the [[microcomputer revolution]] of the 1970s and 1980s, later making Microsoft the world's largest [[personal computer]] software company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/global2000/list/#industry:Software%2520%2526%2520Programming |title=The World's Biggest Public Companies |newspaper=Forbes |language=en|access-date=October 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen was ranked as the [[The World's Billionaires|44th-wealthiest person in the world]] by ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2018, with an estimated net worth of $20.3 billion at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/paul-allen/?list=billionaires#c7afc4a4417b|title=#44 Paul Allen - 2018 Billionaires Net Worth|magazine= Forbes|access-date=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/paul-allen/#77d8bf564417|title=#21 Paul Allen - 2018 Forbes 400 Net Worth|access-date=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/15/microsoft-co-founder-paul-allen-dies-of-cancer-at-age-65.html|title=Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen dies of cancer at age 65|work=CNBC|accessdate=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen left active operations at Microsoft in early 1983 after a [[Hodgkin lymphoma]] diagnosis, remaining on its board as vice chairman. He and his sister, [[Jody Allen]], founded [[Vulcan Inc.]] in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vulcan.com/About/Leadership-(1)|title=Leadership|last=|first=|date=|website=Vulcan.com|publisher=|access-date=July 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704094836/http://www.vulcan.com/About/Leadership-(1)|archive-date=July 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; a privately held company that managed his various business and philanthropic efforts. He had a multi-billion dollar investment portfolio including technology and media companies, scientific research, real estate holdings, private space flight ventures, and stakes in other sectors. He owned the [[Seattle Seahawks]] of the [[National Football League]]&lt;ref name="seahawks"/&gt; and the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]],&lt;ref name="trailblazers"/&gt; and was part-owner of the [[Seattle Sounders FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]].&lt;ref name="soccer"/&gt; In 2000 he resigned from his position on Microsoft's board and assumed the post of senior strategy advisor to the company's management team.

==Early life==
[[File:Paul Allen and Bill Gates at Lakeside School in 1970.jpg|thumb|Allen (left) with [[Bill Gates]] at [[Lakeside School (Seattle)|Lakeside School]] in 1970]]
Allen was born on January 21, 1953, in [[Seattle]], Washington, to Kenneth Sam Allen and Edna Faye (née Gardner) Allen.&lt;ref name="more than money"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.washington.edu/support/endowments/allend |title=Kenneth S. and Faye G. Allen Library Endowment – UW Libraries |publisher=Lib.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Lakeside School (Seattle, Washington)|Lakeside School]], a private school in Seattle where he befriended [[Bill Gates]], with whom he shared an enthusiasm for computers, and they used Lakeside's [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] terminal to develop their programming skills on several time-sharing computer systems.&lt;ref name="before microsoft"&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Paul Allen|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/05/paul-allen-201105 |title=Microsoft's Odd Couple |magazine=Vanity Fair |date=May 2011 |accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also used the laboratory of the Computer Science Department of the [[University of Washington]], doing personal research and computer programming; they were banned from the laboratory in 1971 for abuse of their privileges there.&lt;ref&gt;Hannelore Sudermann, "Paul Allen, Welcome Back", ''Columns'' (University of Washington alumni magazine), June 2017, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates and Allen joined with [[Ric Weiland]] and Gates' childhood best friend and first collaborator, Kent Evans, to form the Lakeside Programing Club and find bugs in [[Computer Center Corporation]]'s software, in exchange for extra computer time. In 1972, after Evans' sudden death due to a mountain climbing accident, Gates turned to Allen for help finishing an automated system of Lakeside's entire class scheduling procedure.{{r|leibovich20001231}} They then formed [[Traf-O-Data]] to make traffic counters based on the [[Intel 8008]] processor. According to Allen, he and Gates would go "dumpster diving" in their teenage years for computer program code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Idea Man: A Memoir by the Cofounder of Microsoft|last=Allen|first=Paul|publisher=Portfolio/Penguin|year=2012|isbn=978-1-101-47645-1|location=p. 40|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen attained a perfect [[SAT]] score of 1600&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newsday.com/from-the-archives-twin-brothers-both-get-a-flawless-1600-on-the-sat-but-long-beach-seniors-simply-take-it-in-stride-1.6248090 From the archives: Twin brothers both get a flawless 1600 on the SAT, but Long Beach seniors simply take it in stride] Newsday&lt;/ref&gt; and went to [[Washington State University]], where he joined the [[Phi Kappa Theta]] fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phikaps.org/?page=alumnibookshelf |title=Alumni Bookshelf – Phi Kappa Theta Fraternity, Incorporated |publisher=Phikaps.org |date= |accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/06/us/high-tech-fraternity.html High-Tech Fraternity] The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2010/12/paul_allen_to_give_26_million.html Paul Allen to give $26 million to Washington State University] The Oregonian&lt;/ref&gt; He dropped out of college after two years to work as a programmer for [[Honeywell]] in [[Boston]] near [[Harvard University]] where Gates was enrolled.&lt;ref name="before microsoft"/&gt; Allen convinced Gates to drop out of Harvard in order to create [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref name=abc2007&gt;[https://abcnews.go.com/Business/Technology/story?id=2857296&amp;page=1 Paul Allen: World's Sixth-Richest Man and Bill Gates 'Quirky Twin'] ABC News&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen and Gates formed Microsoft in 1975 in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], and began marketing a [[BASIC]] programming language interpreter, with their first employee being high school friend and collaborator [[Ric Weiland]].&lt;ref name="thocp1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft history |publisher=The History of Computing Project |url=http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm |accessdate=November 20, 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514211138/http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="before microsoft"/&gt; Allen came up with the name of "Micro-Soft", a combination of "microcomputer" and "software".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1995/10/02/206528/index.htm | work= CNN | first= Bill | last= Gates | title= Bill Gates &amp; Paul Allen Talk Check Out The Ultimate Buddy Act in Business History: The Multibillionaire Co-Founders Of Microsoft Sit Still For An Entire Afternoon To Tell Fortune's Brent Schlender Their Story And Speculate About The Future Of Personal Computing And Telecommunications | date= October 2, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft committed to delivering a disk operating system ([[DOS]]) to IBM for the original [[IBM PC]] in 1980, although they had not yet developed one, and Allen spearheaded a deal for Microsoft to purchase [[86-DOS|QDOS]] (Quick and Dirty Operating System) written by [[Tim Paterson]] who was employed at [[Seattle Computer Products]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/07/30/msdos_paternity_suit_resolved/ MS-DOS paternity suit settled] The Register&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-cofounder-paul-allen-dies-at-age-65-2018-10 Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen dies at 65 after a battle with cancer] Business Insider&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this transaction, Microsoft secured a contract to supply the DOS that ran on IBM's PC line and led to Allen's and Gates' wealth and success.&lt;ref name="before microsoft"/&gt;

===Science and research===
[[File:Paul G. Allen at Allen Institute for Brain Science.jpg|right|thumb|Allen (right) studies a brain sample with Allan Jones, CEO of the [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]], in 2011]]
In September 2003, Allen launched the [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]] with a $100&amp;nbsp;million contribution dedicated to understanding how the human brain works. In total, Allen donated $500&amp;nbsp;million to the institute, making it his single largest philanthropic recipient. Since its launch, the Allen Institute for Brain Science has taken a Big Science and Open Science approach to tackle projects. The institute makes research tools available to the scientific community using an open data model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2012/03/21/billionaire-paul-g-allen-donates-300-million-in-brain-research-to-understand-what-makes-us-human/|title = Billionaire Paul Allen Pours $500 Million into Quest To Find The Essence of Humanity in the Brain | work=Forbes | first=Matthew|last=Herper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the institute's most notable projects include the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, Allen Human Brain Atlas and the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas.

===Environment and conservation===
Allen provided more than $7&amp;nbsp;million to fund a census of elephant populations in Africa, the largest such endeavour since the 1970s. The [[Great Elephant Census]] team flew over 20 countries to survey African savannah elephants.  The survey results were published in 2015 and showed rapid rates of decline which were accelerating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatelephantcensus.com/|title=Great Elephant Census|work=Great Elephant Census|accessdate=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exploration ===
In 2012, along with his research team and the [[Royal Navy]], Allen attempted to retrieve the bell from {{HMS|Hood|51|6}}, which sank in the [[Denmark Strait]] during World War II, but the attempt failed due to poor weather.

==''Idea Man''==
In 2011, Allen's memoir, ''[[Idea Man: A Memoir by the Cofounder of Microsoft]]'', was published by Portfolio, a [[Penguin Group]] imprint. The book recounts how Allen became enamored with computers at an early age, conceived the idea for Microsoft, recruited his friend Bill Gates to join him, and launched what would become the world's most successful software company.

The book made ''[[The New York Times Best Seller list]]'' and the paperback version, which included a new epilogue, came out on October 30, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bishop|first=Todd|title=Microsoft founders Allen, Gates reconnect after year-long rift|url=http://www.geekwire.com/2012/microsoft-cofounders-allen-gates-patch-extended-rift/|work=GeekWire|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Paul, [https://archive.org/details/ideamanmemoirbyc00alle_0 ''Idea Man: a memoir by the co-founder of Microsoft''], New York : Portfolio/Penguin, 2011. {{ISBN|978-1-59184-382-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
