'''Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance''' is the transmission of epigenetic markers from one organism to the next (i.e., parent–child transmission) that affects the traits of offspring without alteration of the [[nucleic acid primary structure|primary structure]] of [[DNA]] (i.e. the sequence of nucleotides)&lt;ref name=Moore_2015&gt;{{cite book | last1= Moore | first1= David S. | name-list-format= vanc | title= The Developing Genome | date= 2015 | publisher= Oxford University Press | isbn= 978-0-19-992234-5 }}{{pages needed|date= May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|168}}&lt;ref name="Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance 2014 review"&gt;

The less precise term '''"epigenetic inheritance"''' may cover both cell–cell and organism–organism information transfer. Although these two levels of epigenetic inheritance are equivalent in [[unicellular organism]]s, they may have distinct mechanisms and evolutionary distinctions in [[multicellular organism]]s.

The environment can induce the epigenetic marks (epigenetic tags) for some epigenetically influenced traits,&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt; and some marks are heritable,&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt; leading some to view epigenetics as a relaxation of biology's rejection of the [[Lamarckism|inheritance of acquired characteristics (Lamarckism)]].&lt;ref name="Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance 2014 review"/&gt;

==Epigenetic categories==

Four general categories of epigenetic modification are known:&lt;ref&gt;[[Eva Jablonka|Jablonka E]] and [[Marion Lamb|MJ Lamb]] (2010). Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In: M Pigliucci and GB Müller Evolution, the expanded synthesis&lt;/ref&gt;
# self-sustaining metabolic loops, in which a [[messenger RNA|mRNA]] or [[protein]] product of a gene stimulates [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the gene; e.g. ''Wor1'' gene in ''[[Candida albicans]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Zordan RE, Galgoczy DJ, Johnson AD |title= Epigenetic properties of white-opaque switching in Candida albicans are based on a self-sustaining transcriptional feedback loop |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume= 103 |issue= 34 |pages= 12807–12 |date= August 2006 |pmid= 16899543 |pmc= 1535343 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0605138103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[chromatin]] marks, in which methyl or acetyl groups bind to DNA [[nucleotide]]s or [[histone]]s thereby altering gene expression patterns; e.g. ''Lcyc'' gene in ''[[Linaria vulgaris]]'' described below

==Inheritance of epigenetic marks==
{{Main|Epigenetics}}

Epigenetic variation may take one of four general forms. Others may yet be elucidated, but currently self-sustaining feedback loops, spatial templating, chromatin marking, and RNA-mediated pathways modify epigenes at the level of individual cells. Epigenetic variation within multicellular organisms may be endogenous, generated by cell–cell signaling (e.g. during cell differentiation early in development), or exogenous, a cellular response to environmental cues.

===Removal vs. retention===
In sexually reproducing organisms, much of the epigenetic modification within cells is reset during meiosis (e.g. marks at the FLC locus controlling plant vernalization&lt;ref name="Bond"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Bond DM, Finnegan EJ |author-link2= Jean Finnegan |title= Passing the message on: inheritance of epigenetic traits |journal= Trends in Plant Science |volume= 12 |issue= 5 |pages= 211–6 |year= 2007 |pmid= 17434332 |doi= 10.1016/j.tplants.2007.03.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;), though some epigenetic responses have been shown to be conserved (e.g. transposon methylation in plants&lt;ref name="Bond"/&gt;). Differential inheritance of epigenetic marks due to underlying maternal or paternal biases in removal or retention mechanisms may lead to the assignment of epigenetic causation to some parent of origin effects in animals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Morison IM, Reeve AE |title= A catalogue of imprinted genes and parent-of-origin effects in humans and animals |journal= Human Molecular Genetics |volume= 7 |issue= 10 |pages= 1599–609 |year= 1998 |pmid= 9735381 |doi= 10.1093/hmg/7.10.1599|doi-access= free }}&lt;/ref&gt; and plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Scott RJ, Spielman M, Bailey J, Dickinson HG |title= Parent-of-origin effects on seed development in Arabidopsis thaliana |journal= Development |volume= 125 |issue= 17 |pages= 3329–41 |date= September 1998 |pmid= 9693137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reprogramming===
In mammals, epigenetic marks are erased during two phases of the life cycle. Firstly just after fertilization and secondly, in the developing primordial germ cells, the precursors to future gametes.&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt; During fertilization the male and female gametes join in different cell cycle states and with different configuration of the genome. The epigenetic marks of the male are rapidly diluted. First, the protamines associated with male DNA are replaced with histones from the female's [[cytoplasm]], most of which are acetylated due to either higher abundance of acetylated histones in the female's cytoplasm or through preferential binding of the male DNA to acetylated histones.&lt;ref name="pmid9409678"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Adenot PG, Mercier Y, Renard JP, Thompson EM |title= Differential H4 acetylation of paternal and maternal chromatin precedes DNA replication and differential transcriptional activity in pronuclei of 1-cell mouse embryos |journal= Development |volume= 124 |issue= 22 |pages= 4615–25 |year= 1997 |pmid= 9409678 |doi= |url= http://dev.biologists.org/content/develop/124/22/4615.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11784103"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Santos F, Hendrich B, Reik W, Dean W |title= Dynamic reprogramming of DNA methylation in the early mouse embryo |journal= Developmental Biology |volume= 241 |issue= 1 |pages= 172–82 |year= 2002 |pmid= 11784103 |doi= 10.1006/dbio.2001.0501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, male DNA is systematically demethylated in many organisms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Oswald J, Engemann S, Lane N, Mayer W, Olek A, Fundele R, Dean W, Reik W, Walter J |title= Active demethylation of the paternal genome in the mouse zygote |journal= Current Biology |volume= 10 |issue= 8 |pages= 475–8 |date= April 2000 |pmid= 10801417 |doi= 10.1016/S0960-9822(00)00448-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15579587"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Fulka H, Mrazek M, Tepla O, Fulka J |title= DNA methylation pattern in human zygotes and developing embryos |journal= Reproduction (Cambridge, England) |volume= 128 |issue= 6 |pages= 703–8 |year= 2004 |pmid= 15579587 |doi= 10.1530/rep.1.00217|doi-access= free }}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly through [[5-hydroxymethylcytosine]]. However, some epigenetic marks, particularly maternal DNA methylation, can escape this reprogramming; leading to parental imprinting.

In the primordial [[germ cell]]s (PGC) there is a more extensive erasure of epigenetic information. However, some rare sites can also evade erasure of DNA methylation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Hackett JA, Sengupta R, Zylicz JJ, Murakami K, Lee C, Down TA, Surani MA |title= Germline DNA demethylation dynamics and imprint erasure through 5-hydroxymethylcytosine |journal= Science |volume= 339 |issue= 6118 |pages= 448–52 |date= January 2013 |pmid= 23223451 |doi= 10.1126/science.1229277|pmc= 3847602 |bibcode= 2013Sci...339..448H }}&lt;/ref&gt; If epigenetic marks evade erasure during both zygotic and PGC reprogramming events, this could enable transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.

Recognition of the importance of epigenetic programming to the establishment and fixation of cell line identity during early embryogenesis has recently stimulated interest in artificial removal of epigenetic programming.&lt;ref name="pmid21139069"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Surani MA, Hajkova P |title= Epigenetic reprogramming of mouse germ cells toward totipotency |journal= Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology |volume= 75 |issue= |pages= 211–8 |year= 2010 |pmid= 21139069 |doi= 10.1101/sqb.2010.75.010|doi-access= free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epigenetic manipulations may allow for restoration of [[totipotency]] in [[stem cell]]s or cells more generally, thus generalizing [[regenerative medicine]].

===Retention===
Cellular mechanisms may allow for co-transmission of some epigenetic marks. During replication, DNA polymerases working on the leading and lagging strands are coupled by the DNA processivity factor [[proliferating cell nuclear antigen]] (PCNA), which has also been implicated in patterning and strand crosstalk that allows for copy fidelity of epigenetic marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Zhang Z, Shibahara K, Stillman B |title= PCNA connects DNA replication to epigenetic inheritance in yeast |journal= Nature |volume= 408 |issue= 6809 |pages= 221–5 |date= November 2000 |pmid= 11089978 |doi= 10.1038/35041601|bibcode= 2000Natur.408..221Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7907981"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Henderson DS, Banga SS, Grigliatti TA, Boyd JB |title= Mutagen sensitivity and suppression of position-effect variegation result from mutations in mus209, the Drosophila gene encoding PCNA |journal= The EMBO Journal |volume= 13 |issue= 6 |pages= 1450–9 |year= 1994 |pmid= 7907981 |pmc= 394963 |doi=10.1002/j.1460-2075.1994.tb06399.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on histone modification copy fidelity has remained in the model phase, but early efforts suggest that modifications of new histones are patterned on those of the old histones and that new and old histones randomly assort between the two daughter DNA strands.&lt;ref name="pmid19234478"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Probst AV, Dunleavy E, Almouzni G |title= Epigenetic inheritance during the cell cycle |journal= Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology |volume= 10 |issue= 3 |pages= 192–206 |year= 2009 |pmid= 19234478 |doi= 10.1038/nrm2640}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to transfer to the next generation, many marks are removed as described above. Emerging studies are finding patterns of epigenetic conservation across generations. For instance, [[centromere|centromeric]] satellites resist demethylation.&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Morgan HD, Santos F, Green K, Dean W, Reik W |title= Epigenetic reprogramming in mammals |journal= Human Molecular Genetics |volume= 14 |issue= Review Issue 1 |pages= R47–58 |year= 2005 |pmid= 15809273 |doi= 10.1093/hmg/ddi114|doi-access= free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism responsible for this conservation is not known, though some evidence suggests that methylation of histones may contribute.&lt;ref name="Morgan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15766761"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Santos F, Peters AH, Otte AP, Reik W, Dean W |title= Dynamic chromatin modifications characterise the first cell cycle in mouse embryos |journal= Developmental Biology |volume= 280 |issue= 1 |pages= 225–36 |year= 2005 |pmid= 15766761 |doi= 10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.01.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dysregulation of the promoter methylation timing associated with gene expression dysregulation in the embryo was also identified.&lt;ref name="pmid26677731"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Taguchi YH |title= Identification of aberrant gene expression associated with aberrant promoter methylation in primordial germ cells between E13 and E16 rat F3 generation vinclozolin lineage |journal= BMC Bioinformatics |volume= 16 Suppl 18 |issue= |pages= S16 |year= 2015 |pmid= 26677731 |pmc= 4682393 |doi= 10.1186/1471-2105-16-S18-S16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decay===
Whereas the [[mutation rate]] in a given 100-base gene may be 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; per generation, epigenes may "mutate" several times per generation or may be fixed for many generations.&lt;ref name="pmid16534512"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Richards EJ |title= Inherited epigenetic variation--revisiting soft inheritance |journal= Nature Reviews Genetics |volume= 7 |issue= 5 |pages= 395–401 |year= 2006 |pmid= 16534512 |doi= 10.1038/nrg1834}}&lt;/ref&gt; This raises the question: do changes in epigene frequencies constitute evolution? Rapidly decaying epigenetic effects on phenotypes (i.e. lasting less than three generations) may explain some of the residual variation in phenotypes after genotype and environment are accounted for. However, distinguishing these short-term effects from the effects of the maternal environment on early [[ontogeny]] remains a challenge.

==Contribution to phenotypes==
The relative importance of genetic and epigenetic inheritance is subject to debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Jablonka E, Lamb MJ |year= 1998 |title= Epigenetic inheritance in evolution |journal= Journal of Evolutionary Biology |volume= 11 |issue= 2 |pages= 159–183 |doi= 10.1046/j.1420-9101.1998.11020159.x|url= https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1d368427aa3fd286a1f78ae13526f223031e8ffd }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Bird A, Kirschner M, Gerhart J, Moore T, Wopert L |year= 1998 |title= Comments on "Epigenetic inheritance in evolution" |journal= Journal of Evolutionary Biology |volume= 11 |issue= 2 |pages= 185–188, 213–217, 229–232, 239–240 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jeb.1998.11.issue-2/issuetoc#group3 |doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.1998.11020185.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though hundreds of examples of epigenetic modification of phenotypes have been published,&lt;ref name="Jablonka"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Jablonka E, Raz G |title= Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance: prevalence, mechanisms, and implications for the study of heredity and evolution |journal= The Quarterly Review of Biology |volume= 84 |issue= 2 |pages= 131–76 |year= 2009 |pmid= 19606595 |doi= 10.1086/598822|citeseerx= 10.1.1.617.6333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Rassoulzadegan M, Cuzin F |year= 2015 |title= Epigenetic heredity: RNA-mediated modes of phenotypic variation |url= |journal= Ann N Y Acad Sci |volume= 1341 |issue= 1|pages= 172–5 |doi= 10.1111/nyas.12694|pmid= 25726734 |bibcode= 2015NYASA1341..172R }}&lt;/ref&gt; few studies have been conducted outside of the laboratory setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bossdorf O, Richards CL, Pigliucci M |year= 2008 |title= Epigenetics for ecologists |doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01130.x |pmid= 18021243 |journal= Ecology Letters |volume= 11 |issue= 2|pages= 106–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the interactions of genes and epigenes with the environment cannot be inferred despite the central role of environment in natural selection. Experimental methodologies for manipulating epigenetic mechanisms are nascent (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Molinier J, Ries G, Zipfel C, Hohn B |title= Transgeneration memory of stress in plants |journal= Nature |volume= 442 |issue= 7106 |pages= 1046–9 |date= August 2006 |pmid= 16892047 |doi= 10.1038/nature05022|bibcode= 2006Natur.442.1046M }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and will need rigorous demonstration before studies explicitly testing the relative contributions of genotype, environment, and epigenotype are feasible.

===In humans===
A number of studies suggest the existence of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in humans.&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt; These include [[Dutch famine of 1944–45#Legacy|those of the Dutch famine of 1944–45]], wherein the offspring born during the famine were smaller than those born the year before the famine and the effects could last for two generations.

The [[Överkalix study]] noted sex-specific effects; a greater [[body mass index]] (BMI) at 9 years in sons, but not daughters, of fathers who began smoking early. The paternal grandfather's food supply was only linked to the mortality RR of grandsons and not granddaughters. The paternal grandmother's food supply was only associated with the granddaughters' mortality risk ratio. When the grandmother had a good food supply was associated with a twofold higher mortality (RR).
This transgenerational inheritance was observed with exposure during the slow growth period (SGP). The SGP is the time before the start of [[puberty]], when environmental factors have a larger impact on the body. The ancestors' SGP in this study was set between the ages of 9-12 for boys and 8–10 years for girls. This occurred in the SGP of both grandparents, or during the [[gestation]] period/infant life of the grandmothers, but not during either grandparent's puberty. The father's poor food supply and the mother's good food supply were associated with a lower risk of [[cardiovascular]] death.&lt;ref name="WeiSchatten2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lalande-1996"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Lalande M |title= Parental imprinting and human disease |journal= Annual Review of Genetics |volume= 30 |issue= |pages= 173–95 |year= 1996 |pmid= 8982453 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.genet.30.1.173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of genetic expression which results in [[Prader–Willi syndrome]] or [[Angelman syndrome]] has in some cases been found to be caused by epigenetic changes (or "epimutations") on both the [[allele]]s, rather than involving any genetic [[mutation]]. In all 19 informative cases, the epimutations that, together with physiological imprinting and therefore silencing of the other [[allele]], were causing these syndromes were localized on a chromosome with a specific parental and grandparental origin. Specifically, the paternally derived chromosome carried an abnormal maternal mark at the [[SNRPN upstream reading frame protein|SNURF-SNRPN]], and this abnormal mark was inherited from the paternal grandmother.&lt;ref name="WeiSchatten2014"/&gt;

Similarly, epimutations on the [[MLH1]] gene has been found in two individuals with a phenotype of [[hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer]], and without any frank MLH1 mutation which otherwise causes the disease. The same epimutations were also found on the spermatozoa of one of the individuals, indicating the potential to be transmitted to offspring.&lt;ref name="WeiSchatten2014"/&gt;

==Effects on fitness==
{{See also|Neo-Lamarckism}}
Epigenetic inheritance may only affect [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] if it predictably alters a trait under selection. Evidence has been forwarded that environmental stimuli are important agents in the alteration of epigenes. Ironically, Darwinian evolution may act on these neo-Lamarckian acquired characteristics as well as the cellular mechanisms producing them (e.g. methyltransferase genes).
Epigenetic inheritance may confer a fitness benefit to organisms that deal with environmental changes at intermediate timescales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Jablonka |first1= Eva |last2= Lamb |first2= Marion J. |name-list-format= vanc |title= Epigenetic inheritance and evolution: the Lamarckian dimension |date= 2005 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-0-19-854063-2 |edition= Reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short-cycling changes are likely to have DNA-encoded regulatory processes, as the probability of the offspring needing to respond to changes multiple times during their lifespans is high. On the other end, natural selection will act on populations experiencing changes on longer-cycling environmental changes. In these cases, if [[Epigenetic Priming|epigenetic priming]] of the next generation is deleterious to fitness over most of the interval (e.g. misinformation about the environment), these genotypes and epigenotypes will be lost. For intermediate time cycles, the probability of the offspring encountering a similar environment is sufficiently high without substantial selective pressure on individuals lacking a genetic architecture capable of responding to the environment. Naturally, the absolute lengths of short, intermediate, and long environmental cycles will depend on the trait, the length of epigenetic memory, and the generation time of the organism.
Much of the interpretation of epigenetic fitness effects centers on the hypothesis that epigenes are important contributors to phenotypes, which remains to be resolved.

Inherited epigenetic marks may be important for regulating important components of fitness. In plants, for instance, the ''Lcyc'' gene in ''[[Linaria vulgaris]]'' controls the symmetry of the flower.

==Macroevolutionary patterns==
Inherited epigenetic effects on phenotypes have been documented in bacteria, protists, fungi, plants, and animals.&lt;ref name="Jablonka"/&gt; Though no systematic study of epigenetic inheritance has been conducted (most focus on model organisms), there is preliminary evidence that this mode of inheritance is more important in plants than in animals.&lt;ref name="Jablonka"/&gt; The early differentiation of animal [[germline]]s is likely to preclude epigenetic marking occurring later in development, while in plants and fungi [[somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells may be incorporated into the germ line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Whitham TG, Slobodchikoff CN |year= 1981 |title= Evolution by individuals, plant-herbivore interactions, and mosaics of genetic variability: The adaptive significance of somatic mutations in plants |url= |journal= Oecologia |volume= 49 |issue= 3 |pages= 287–292 |doi= 10.1007/BF00347587|pmid= 28309985 |bibcode= 1981Oecol..49..287W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Turian G |year= 1979 |title= Sporogenesis in fungi |journal= Annual Review of Phytopathology |volume= 12 |pages= 129–137 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.py.12.090174.001021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Life history theory|Life history]] patterns may also contribute to the occurrence of epigenetic inheritance. [[Sessility (motility)|Sessile]] organisms, those with low dispersal capability, and those with simple behavior may benefit most from conveying information to their offspring via epigenetic pathways. Geographic patterns may also emerge, where highly variable and highly conserved environments might host fewer species with important epigenetic inheritance.

==Controversies==

Humans have long recognized that traits of the parents are often seen in offspring. This insight led to the practical application of selective breeding of plants and animals, but did not address the central question of inheritance: how are these traits conserved between generations, and what causes variation? Several positions have been held in the history of evolutionary thought.

===Blending vs. particulate inheritance===
[[File:Blending Inheritance.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Blending inheritance]] leads to the averaging out of every characteristic, which as the engineer [[Fleeming Jenkin]] pointed out, makes evolution by natural selection impossible.]]

Addressing these related questions, scientists during the time of the Enlightenment largely argued for the blending hypothesis, in which parental traits were homogenized in the offspring much like buckets of different colored paint being mixed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Vorzimmer P |year= 1963 |title= Charles Darwin and blending inheritance |url= |journal= Isis |volume= 54 |issue= 3 |pages= 371–390 |doi= 10.1086/349734}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Charles Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species'', pointed out that under this scheme of inheritance, variation would quickly be swamped by the majority phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Jenkin F |year= 1867 |title= Review of ''The Origin of Species'' |journal= North British Review |url= http://www.victorianweb.org/science/science_texts/jenkins.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the paint bucket analogy, this would be seen by mixing two colors together and then mixing the resulting color with only one of the parent colors 20 times; the rare variant color would quickly fade.

Unknown to most of the European scientific community, a monk by the name of [[Gregor Mendel]] had resolved the question of how traits are conserved between generations through breeding experiments with pea plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors= Mendel G |year= 1866 |title= Versuche über Plflanzenhybriden. Verhandlungen des naturforschenden Vereines in Brünn |trans-title= Experiments in Plant Hybridization |language= German |work= Read at the February 8th, and March 8th, 1865, meetings of the Brünn Natural History Society |url= http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/gm-65-a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Darwin]] thus did not know of Mendel's proposed "particulate inheritance" in which traits were not blended but passed to offspring in discrete units that we now call genes. Darwin came to reject the blending hypothesis even though his ideas and Mendel's were not unified until the 1930s, a period referred to as the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]].

===Inheritance of innate vs. acquired characteristics===
In his 1809 book, ''[[Philosophie Zoologique]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors= Lamarck, JB |year= 1809 |title= Philosophie zoologique: ou Exposition des considérations relative à l'histoire naturelle des animaux. Dentu et L'Auteur, Paris |url= https://books.google.com/?id=8NsTAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Philosophie+zoologique:+ou+Exposition+des+consid%C3%A9rations+relative}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] recognized that each species experiences a unique set of challenges due to its form and environment. Thus, he proposed that the characters used most often would accumulate a "nervous fluid." Such acquired accumulations would then be transmitted to the individual's offspring. In modern terms, a nervous fluid transmitted to offspring would be a form of epigenetic inheritance.

[[Lamarckism]], as this body of thought became known, was the standard explanation for change in species over time when Charles Darwin and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] co-proposed a theory of evolution by natural selection in 1859. Responding to Darwin and Wallace's theory, a revised [[neo-Lamarckism]] attracted a small following of biologists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bowler |first1= Peter J. |author-link= Peter J. Bowler |name-list-format= vanc |title= Evolution, the history of an idea |date= 1989 |publisher= University of California Press |location= Berkeley |isbn= 978-0-520-06386-0 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/evolutionhistory0000bowl }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the Lamarckian zeal was quenched in large part due to [[August Weismann|Weismann's]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors= Weismann A |year= 1891 |title= Essays upon heredity and kindred biological problems |url= https://archive.org/details/essaysuponheredi189101weis |veditors= Poulton EB, Schönland S, Shipley E |publisher= Clarendon Press |location= Oxford |doi= 10.5962/bhl.title.28066}}&lt;/ref&gt; famous experiment in which he cut off the tails of mice over several successive generations without having any effect on tail length. Thus the emergent consensus that acquired characteristics could not be inherited became canon.&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt;

===Revision of evolutionary theory===
Non-genetic variation and inheritance, however, proved to be quite common. Concurrent with the 20th-century development of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century) |modern evolutionary synthesis]] (unifying Mendelian genetics and natural selection), [[C. H. Waddington]] (1905-1975) was working to unify [[developmental biology]] and genetics. In so doing, he adopted the word "epigenetic"&lt;ref&gt;{{oed | epigenetic &lt;/ref&gt; to represent the ordered differentiation of embryonic cells into functionally distinct cell types despite having identical primary structure of their DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors= Waddington CH |year= 2016 |title= Introduction to Modern Genetics |publisher= Allen and Unwin |location= London | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QpbDCwAAQBAJ | chapter = Development as an Epigenetic Process
 | quote = One of the classical controversies in embryology was that between the preformationists and the epigenisists[sic]. [...] the interaction of these constituents gives rise to new types of tissue and organ which were not present originally, and in so far development must be considered as 'epigenetic.' |orig-year = 1939 | isbn = 9781317352037}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers discussed Waddington's epigenetics sporadically - it became more of a catch-all for puzzling non-genetic heritable characters rather than a concept advancing the body of inquiry.&lt;ref name="pmid17998809"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors= Holliday R | title= Epigenetics: a historical overview | journal= Epigenetics | volume= 1 | issue= 2 | pages= 76–80 | year= 2006 | pmid= 17998809 | doi= 10.4161/epi.1.2.2762| doi-access= free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors= Nanney DL | title= Epigenetic Control Systems | journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume= 44 | issue= 7 | pages= 712–7 | date= July 1958 | pmid= 16590265 | pmc= 528649 | doi= 10.1073/pnas.44.7.712| bibcode= 1958PNAS...44..712N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the definition of Waddington's word has itself evolved, broadening beyond the subset of developmentally signaled, inherited cell specialization.

Some scientists have questioned whether epigenetic inheritance compromises the foundation of the modern synthesis. Outlining the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], [[Francis Crick]]&lt;ref name="pmid13580867"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors= Crick FH | title= On protein synthesis | journal= Symposia of the Society for Experimental Biology | volume= 12 | issue= | pages= 138–63 | year= 1958 | pmid= 13580867 | doi= | url= http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/B/F/T/_/scbbft.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; succinctly stated, "DNA is held in a configuration by histone[s] so that it can act as a passive template for the simultaneous synthesis of RNA and protein[s]. ''None'' of the detailed 'information' is in the histone." However, he closes the article stating, "this scheme ''explains the majority'' of the present experimental results!" Indeed, the emergence of epigenetic inheritance (in addition to advances in the study of evolutionary-development, [[phenotypic plasticity]], evolvability, and systems biology) has strained the current framework of the modern evolutionary synthesis, and prompted the re-examination of previously dismissed evolutionary mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors= Pigliucci M | title= Do we need an extended evolutionary synthesis? | journal= Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution | volume= 61 | issue= 12 | pages= 2743–9 | date= December 2007 | pmid= 17924956 | doi= 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00246.x| url= https://philpapers.org/rec/PIGDWN }}&lt;/ref&gt;

and others that the logical inconsistencies as well as Lamarckian Inheritance effects involving direct DNA modifications, as well as the just described indirect, viz. epigenetic, transmissions, challenge conventional thinking in evolutionary biology and adjacent fields.
