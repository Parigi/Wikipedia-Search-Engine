[[Microsoft]] is a multinational computer technology corporation. Microsoft was founded on April 4, 1975, by [[Bill Gates]] and [[Paul Allen]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="founding"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5085630.stm | title=Bill Gates: A Timeline | accessdate=2006-07-03 | work=BBC News | date=June 15, 2006 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622201711/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5085630.stm | archivedate=June 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its current best-selling products are the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]]; [[Microsoft Office]], a suite of productivity software; [[Xbox]], a line of entertainment of games, music, and video; [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], a line of search engines; and [[Microsoft Azure]], a cloud services platform.&lt;ref name="MSFT-20190130"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2019-Q2/press-release-webcast |title=FY19 Q2{{Snd}} Press Releases{{Snd}} Investor Relations |website=[[Microsoft]] |date=January 30, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Microsoft formed a partnership with IBM to bundle Microsoft's operating system with IBM computers; with that deal, IBM paid Microsoft a royalty for every sale. In 1985, IBM requested Microsoft to develop a new operating system for their computers called [[OS/2]]. Microsoft produced that operating system, but also continued to sell their own alternative, which proved to be in direct competition with OS/2. Microsoft Windows eventually overshadowed OS/2 in terms of sales. When Microsoft launched several versions of Microsoft Windows in the 1990s, they had captured over 90% market share of the world's personal computers.

As of June 30, 2015, Microsoft has a global annual revenue of US$86.83 Billion and 128,076 employees worldwide.&lt;ref name="2014Revenue"&gt;{{cite web | title=Microsoft 2014 Facts | url=http://news.microsoft.com/facts-about-microsoft/#RevenueHeadcount | accessdate=October 22, 2014 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113231532/http://news.microsoft.com/facts-about-microsoft/#RevenueHeadcount | archivedate=January 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of [[computer software|software]] products for computing devices.&lt;ref name="2005annual"&gt;{{cite web | title=Microsoft 2005 Annual Report | url=https://www.microsoft.com/msft/ar05/downloads/MS_2005_AR.doc | accessdate=October 1, 2005 | format=DOC | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051008022904/http://www.microsoft.com/msft/ar05/downloads/MS_2005_AR.doc | archivedate=October 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fastfacts"&gt;{{cite web|date=August 1, 2007 |url=https://www.microsoft.com/presspass/inside_ms.mspx |title=Fast Facts About Microsoft |work=microsoft.com |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |accessdate=2007-08-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809015659/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/inside_ms.mspx |archivedate=August 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2007financials"&gt;{{cite web| author = MSFT Investor Relations| date = July 19, 2007| url = https://www.microsoft.com/msft/earnings/FY07/earn_rel_q4_07.mspx| title = Microsoft Fourth Quarter FY 2007 Earnings Release: Microsoft's Annual Revenue Surpasses $50 Billion| work = microsoft.com| publisher = Microsoft Corporation| accessdate = 2007-08-15| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070912235322/http://www.microsoft.com/msft/earnings/FY07/earn_rel_q4_07.mspx| archivedate = September 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1974, [[Paul Allen]], a programmer at [[Honeywell]], was walking through [[Harvard Square]] when he saw the cover of the January 1975 issue of ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' that demonstrated the [[Altair 8800]], the first [[microcomputer]].&lt;ref name="keyevents" /&gt;&lt;ref name="leibovich20001231"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2000/12/31/alter-egos/91b267b0-858c-4d4e-a4bd-48f22e015f70/ |title=Alter Egos |last=Leibovich |first=Mark |date=2000-12-31 |work=Washington Post |access-date=2019-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225224631/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2000/12/31/alter-egos/91b267b0-858c-4d4e-a4bd-48f22e015f70/ |archive-date=2016-12-25 |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286 | url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen bought the magazine and rushed to [[Currier House (Harvard College)|Currier House]] at [[Harvard College]], where he showed it to high school friend [[Bill Gates]].{{r|leibovich20001231}} They saw potential to develop an implementation of [[BASIC]] for the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Key Events in Microsoft History | url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/e/a/7ea5ca8c-4c72-49e9-a694-87ae755e1f58/keyevents.doc | accessdate=June 26, 2012 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021215734/http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/e/a/7ea5ca8c-4c72-49e9-a694-87ae755e1f58/keyevents.doc | archivedate=October 21, 2013 }} ([[DOC (computing)|DOC]] format)&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates called Altair manufacturer [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems]] (MITS), offering to demonstrate the implementation. Allen and Gates had neither an interpreter nor an Altair system, yet in the eight weeks before the demo, they developed an interpreter with the help of [[Monte Davidoff]]. When Allen flew to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] to meet with MITS, the interpreter worked and MITS agreed to distribute [[Altair BASIC]].&lt;ref name=thocp1 /&gt;{{r|leibovich20001231}} Allen moved to Albuquerque, Gates soon quit Harvard to join him, and they co-founded Microsoft there.{{r|leibovich20001231}} Revenues of the company totalled $16,005 by the end of 1976.

Allen came up with the original name of ''Micro-Soft'', a [[portmanteau]] of [[microcomputer]] and [[software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Bill Gates &amp; Paul Allen Talk | url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1995/10/02/206528/index.htm | accessdate=May 3, 2011 | work=CNN | first=Bill | last=Gates | date=October 2, 1995 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503155554/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1995/10/02/206528/index.htm | archivedate=May 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyphenated in its early incarnations, on November 26, 1976, the company was registered under that name with the Secretary of State of New Mexico. The company's first international office was founded on November 1, 1978, in Japan, entitled "[[ASCII (company)|ASCII]] Microsoft" (now called "[[Microsoft Japan]]"), and on November 29, 1979, the term, "Microsoft" was first used by Bill Gates.&lt;ref name="keyevents"&gt;{{cite news | title=What We'll Miss About Bill Gates{{Snd}} a Very Long Good-Bye | url=http://archive.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/16-06/st_billgates | accessdate=May 3, 2011 | work=Wired | date=May 19, 2008 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419102855/http://archive.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/16-06/st_billgates | archivedate=April 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 1979, the company moved from Albuquerque to a new home in [[Bellevue, Washington]],&lt;ref name=keyevents /&gt; since it was hard to recruit top programmers to Albuquerque. Shortly before the move, eleven of the then-thirteen employees posed for the staff photo on the right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/2008/jun08/06-25iconic.aspx |title=Iconic Albuquerque Photo Re-Created |accessdate=31 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424055827/http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/2008/jun08/06-25iconic.aspx |archivedate=April 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steve Ballmer]] joined the company on June 11, 1980, and would later succeed Bill Gates as CEO&lt;ref name=keyevents /&gt; from January 2000 until February 2014. The company restructured on June 25, 1981, to become an incorporated business in its home state of Washington (with a further change of its name to "Microsoft Corporation, Inc."). As part of the restructuring, Bill Gates became president of the company and chairman of the board, and Paul Allen became executive vice president.&lt;ref name=keyevents /&gt; In 1983, Allen left the company after receiving a [[Hodgkin lymphoma]] diagnosis, though he remained on the board as vice-chairman.&lt;ref name="before microsoft"&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Paul Allen|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/05/paul-allen-201105 |title=Microsoft's Odd Couple |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=May 2011 |accessdate=November 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft's early products were different variants of [[Microsoft BASIC]] which was the dominant programming language in late 1970s and early 1980s home computers such as [[Apple II]] ([[Applesoft BASIC]]) and [[Commodore 64]] ([[Commodore BASIC]]), and were also provided with early versions of the [[IBM PC]] as the [[IBM Cassette BASIC]].

Microsoft also marketed through an Apple dealer in West Palm Beach, Florida two products for the Radio-Shack TRS-80. One was "Typing Tutor" which led the user through learning to use a keyboard. The other was authored by a professor at the University of Hawaii called "MuMATH" and had the ability to do mathematics in long integer math to avoid floating point numbers.

The first hardware product&lt;ref name="lock19800506"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1980-05-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_004_1980_May_Jun#page/n7/mode/2up | title=An Apple Breakthru | work=Compute! | date=May–June 1980 | accessdate=25 October 2013 |last1=Lock |first1=Robert |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[Z-80 SoftCard]] which enabled the Apple II to run the [[CP/M]] [[operating system]], at the time an industry-standard operating system for running business software and many [[compiler]]s and [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreters]] for several [[high-level language]]s on [[microcomputer]]s. The SoftCard was first demonstrated publicly at the [[West Coast Computer Faire]] in March 1980.&lt;ref name="Infoworld Apr 1980"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Z-80 Board Puts CP/M on Apple | journal = InfoWorld | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | page = 3 | publisher = Popular Computing | date = April 28, 1980 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Wj4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT2 | issn = 0199-6649 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170314155224/https://books.google.com/books?id=Wj4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT2 | archivedate = March 14, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Infoworld Nov 1980"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Seminar Spills Negotiating Secrets | journal = InfoWorld | volume = 2 | issue = 21 | page = 24 | publisher = Popular Computing | date = November 24, 1980 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mT4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT23 | issn = 0199-6649 | quote = Unsure of the demand for the product, Microsoft took a prototype to the last West Coast Computer Faire | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170314141224/https://books.google.com/books?id=mT4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT23 | archivedate = March 14, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an immediate success; 5,000 cards, a large number given the microcomputer market at the time, were purchased in the initial three months at $349 each and it was Microsoft's number one revenue source in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ballmer|first=Steve|title=Microsoft Surface Keynote|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jozTK-MqEXQ|accessdate=19 June 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620113820/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jozTK-MqEXQ|archivedate=June 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[operating system]] publicly released by the company was a variant of [[Unix]] announced on August 25, 1980. Acquired from [[AT&amp;T]] through a distribution license, Microsoft dubbed it [[Xenix]], and hired [[Santa Cruz Operation]] in order to port/adapt the [[operating system]] to several platforms.&lt;ref name="xenix1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Is It Time Again For Microsoft And Unix? |url=http://www.informationweek.com/author/internet36.htm |author=Jason Levitt |publisher=Information Week |date=June 12, 2000 |accessdate=2006-04-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105100939/http://www.informationweek.com/author/internet36.htm |archivedate=November 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.computersourcemag.com/articles/viewer.asp?a=695 |title=Under The Hood: Part 8 |publisher=Computer Source |author=Dafydd Neal Dyar |date=November 4, 2002 |accessdate=2006-07-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901182630/http://www.computersourcemag.com/articles/viewer.asp?a=695 |archivedate=September 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This Unix variant would become home to the first version of Microsoft's [[word processor]], [[Microsoft Office Word|Microsoft Word]]. Originally titled "Multi-Tool Word", Microsoft Word became notable for its use of "What You See Is What You Get", or [[WYSIWYG]] pioneered by the [[Xerox Alto]] and the [[Bravo (software)|Bravo]] text editor in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Word was first released in the spring of 1983, and free demonstration copies of the application were bundled with the November 1983 issue of [[PC World]], making it one of the first programs to be distributed on-disk with a magazine. (Earlier magazine on-disk distributions included Robert Uiterwyk's BASIC in the May 1977 issue of Information Age.)&lt;ref name="SWTPC-Uiterwyk"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.swtpc.com/mholley/BASIC_2/Uiterwyk.htm |title=Robert Uiterwyk's BASIC |last1=Holley |first1=Michael |date=December 26, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060314130600/http://www.swtpc.com/mholley/BASIC_2/Uiterwyk.htm |archive-date=2006-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Roy | last=A.

[[IBM]] first approached Microsoft about its upcoming [[IBM Personal Computer]] (IBM PC) in July 1980.{{r|bunnell1982febmar}} On August 12, 1981, after negotiations with [[Digital Research]] failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft to provide a version of the [[CP/M]] operating system, which was set to be used in the IBM PC.

Spyglass went on to later dispute the terms of the agreement, as Microsoft was to pay a royalty for every copy sold.

While Microsoft largely failed to participate in the rise of the Internet in the early 1990s, some of the key technologies in which the company had invested to enter the Internet market started to pay off by the mid-90s. One of the most prominent of these was [[ActiveX]], an application programming interface built on the [[Microsoft Component Object Model]] ([[Component Object Model|COM]]); this enabled Microsoft and others to embed controls in many [[programming language]]s, including the company's own [[scripting language]]s, such as [[JScript]] and [[VBScript]]. ActiveX included frameworks for documents and server solutions.&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; The company also released the Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, which had built-in support for internet applications.&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; In November 1996, [[Microsoft Office 97]] was released, which is the first version to include [[Office Assistant]]. In 1997, [[Internet Explorer 4]].0 was released, marking the beginning of the takeover of the browser market from rival [[Netscape]], and by agreement with [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]], Internet Explorer was bundled with the [[Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]] operating system as well as with Windows.&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; [[Windows CE 2.0]], the handheld version of Windows, was released this year, including a host of bug fixes and new features designed to make it more appealing to corporate customers.&lt;ref name=cehistory/&gt; In October, the Justice Department filed a motion in the [[United States district court|federal district court]] in which they stated that Microsoft had violated an agreement signed in 1994, and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt;

The year 1998 was significant in Microsoft's history, with Bill Gates appointing [[Steve Ballmer]] as president of Microsoft but remaining as Chair and CEO himself.&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt; The company released an update to the consumer version of Windows, [[Windows 98]].&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt; Windows 98 came with Internet Explorer 4.0 SP1 (which had [[Windows Desktop Update]] bundled), and included new features from Windows 95 OSR 2.x including the [[File Allocation Table|FAT32]] [[file system]], and new features designed for Windows 98, such as support for multiple displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/win98/proddocs/chapt18.mspx?mfr=true | title=Introducing MS Windows 98, Second Edition{{Snd}} Chapter 18 | accessdate=2006-07-03 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123201013/http://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/win98/proddocs/chapt18.mspx?mfr=true | archivedate=January 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft launched its Indian headquarters as well, which would eventually become the company's second largest after its U.S. headquarters.&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; Finally, a great deal of controversy took place when a set of internal memos from the company were leaked on the Internet.

Microsoft, in 2000, released new products for all three lines of the company's flagship operating system, and saw the beginning of the end of one of its most prominent legal cases. On February 17, Microsoft released an update to its business line of software in [[Windows 2000]]. It provided a high level of stability similar to that of its [[Unix]] counterparts due to its usage of the [[Windows NT]] kernel, and matching features found in the consumer line of the Windows operating system including a DOS [[emulator]] that could run many [[Legacy system|legacy]] DOS applications.&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt;

Part of this ruling was later overturned by a federal [[Appeal|appeals court]], and eventually settled with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2001. On June 15, 2000, the company released a new version of its hand-held operating system, [[Windows CE 3.0]].&lt;ref name=cehistory/&gt; The main change was the new programming APIs of the software. Previous versions of Windows CE supported only a small subset of the [[WinAPI]], the main development library for Windows, and with Version 3 of Windows CE, the operating system now supported nearly all of the core functionality of the WinAPI. The next update to the consumer line, [[Windows ME]] (or Windows Millennium Edition), was released on September 14, 2000.&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt; It sported several new features such as enhanced multimedia abilities and consumer-oriented PC maintenance options, but is often regarded as one of the worst versions of Windows due to stability problems, restricted real mode DOS support and other issues.&lt;ref name=cnettop10worst/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/125772/worst_products_ever.html | title=The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time | work=PCWorld | date=2006-05-26 | accessdate=2017-10-10 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914042155/https://www.pcworld.com/article/125772/worst_products_ever.html | archivedate=September 14, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has sold 40 million units as of 2010 and it has outsold Sony's [[PlayStation 3]] which has so far sold 35 million units. However, despite beating Sony with their last Xbox console, Microsoft so far has been outsold by the [[Wii]] which introduced [[Natural user interface|gesture control]] and opened up a new market for video games. Microsoft later used their popular controller-free [[Kinect]] peripheral to increase the popularity of the Xbox. This was very successful. {{as of|2011}} Kinect was the fastest selling consumer electronics product in history.&lt;ref name=guiness&gt;{{cite web | title=Kinect Confirmed As Fastest-Selling Consumer Electronics Device | url=http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Kinect-Confirmed-As-Fastest-Selling-Consumer-Electronics-Device/blog/3376939/7691.html | publisher=community.guinnessworldrecords.com | accessdate=May 19, 2012 | date=March 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311213211/http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Kinect-Confirmed-As-Fastest-Selling-Consumer-Electronics-Device/blog/3376939/7691.html | archivedate=March 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It sold 8 million units from November 4, 2010, to January 3, 2011, (its first 60 days).

[[Windows Server 2008]] and [[Visual Studio 2008]], the next versions of the company's [[Server (computing)|server]] operating system and development suite, respectively, were released on February 27, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.betanews.com/article/New_Windows_Server_Visual_Studio_SQL_Server_to_Launch_in_February/1184080223 | title = New Windows Server, Visual Studio, SQL Server to Launch in February | author = Nate Mook | publisher = BetaNews | accessdate = 2007-07-11 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070712100708/http://www.betanews.com/article/New_Windows_Server_Visual_Studio_SQL_Server_to_Launch_in_February/1184080223 | archivedate = July 12, 2007 | date = July 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows Vista was criticized for being heavy and needing large amounts of power to run the desktop widgets and the Aero theme. Many people continued to use Windows XP for many years after, due to its stability and low processing needs.

On December 19, 2007, Microsoft signed a five-year, $500 million contract with [[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]] that included content sharing and advertisements. The deal allowed Microsoft to license many shows from Viacom owned cable television and film studios for use on [[Xbox Live]] and [[MSN]]. The deal also made Viacom a preferred publisher partner for casual game development and distribution through MSN and Windows. On the advertisement side of the deal, Microsoft's Atlas ad-serving division became the exclusive provider of previously unsold advertising inventory on Viacom owned web sites. Microsoft also purchased a large amount of advertising on Viacom owned broadcasts and online networks, and collaborated on promotions and sponsorships for MTV and [[BET]] award shows, two Viacom owned cable networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/viacom-microsoft-ink-content-ad-deal/1100-6184160/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130123184517/http://www.gamespot.com/news/viacom-microsoft-ink-content-ad-deal-6184160|url-status=dead|title=Viacom, Microsoft ink content, ad deal|archive-date=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the opening show of the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) was hosted by [[Steve Ballmer]] for the first time. In past years, it has been hosted by [[Bill Gates]]. During the show, Ballmer announced the first public Beta Test of [[Windows 7]] for partners and developers on January 8, but also for the general public two days later. On June 26, 2009, Microsoft started taking pre-orders at a discounted price for Windows 7 which was launched on October 22, 2009. Windows 7 has several editions, which acknowledge the rise of [[netbook]] computers with reduced processing power.
