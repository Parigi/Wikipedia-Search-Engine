'''''Béatrice et Bénédict''''' (''Beatrice and Benedick'') is an ''[[opéra comique]]'' in two acts by French composer [[Hector Berlioz]].&lt;ref&gt;''Berlioz and the Romantic Imagination.'' Catalogue for exhibition at Victoria and Albert Museum for Berlioz centenary. Art Council, London, 1969, p. 46, exhibit 131 (orchestral manuscript score).&lt;/ref&gt; Berlioz wrote the French [[libretto]] himself, based closely on [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]''.

Berlioz had been interested in setting Shakespeare's comedy since his return from Italy in 1833, but only composed the score of ''Béatrice et Bénédict'' following the completion of ''[[Les Troyens]]'' in 1858. It was first performed at the opening of the [[Theater Baden-Baden]] on 9 August 1862.&lt;ref name="GroveOpera"&gt;[[D. Kern Holoman|Holoman D. K.]] "''Béatrice et Bénédict''". In: ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]].'' Macmillan, London and New York, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Berlioz conducted the first two performances of a German version in [[Weimar]] in 1863, where, as he wrote in his memoirs, he was "overwhelmed by all sorts of kind attention."

It is the first notable version of Shakespeare's play in operatic form, and was followed by works by, among others, [[Árpád Doppler]], [[Paul Puget]], [[Charles Villiers Stanford]], and [[Reynaldo Hahn]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson CR. "Shakespeare". In: ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]].'' Macmillan, London and New York, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlioz biographer [[David Cairns (writer)|David Cairns]] has written: "Listening to the score's exuberant gaiety, only momentarily touched by sadness, one would never guess that its composer was in pain when he wrote it and impatient for death".&lt;ref name=CairnsVol2&gt;[[David Cairns (writer)|Cairns, D]]. ''Berlioz: Servitude and Greatness 1832–1869.'' Allen Lane, London, 1999, p. 670.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance history==
Berlioz described the premiere of ''Béatrice et Bénédict'' as a "great success" in a letter to his son Louis; he was particularly taken with the performance of [[Anne Charton-Demeur|Charton-Demeur]] (who would create the role of Didon in ''Les Troyens'' in Paris a year later) and noted that the duo which closes the first half elicited an "astonishing impact".&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Macdonald|MacDonald, Hugh]] (Ed). ''Selected Letters of Berlioz (translated by Roger Nichols)''. Faber &amp; Faber, London, 1995, letter 407.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it continued to be staged occasionally in German cities in the years after the premiere, the first performance in France only took place on 5 June 1890 at the [[Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe|Théâtre de l'Odéon]], promoted by the Société des Grandes auditions musicales de France, conducted by [[Charles Lamoureux]], and with Juliette Bilbaut-Vauchelet and [[Pierre-Émile Engel|Émile Engel]] in the lead roles.&lt;ref name="Annales"&gt;Noel E. &amp; Stoullig E. ''Les Annales du théâtre et de la musique, 16e édition, 1890.'' G. Charpentier et Cie, Paris, 1891, pp. 139–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Bastide]] conducted a notable production of ''Béatrice et Bénédict'' in Strasbourg in the late 1940s.&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Pitt C. Strasbourg. In: ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera.'' Macmillan, London &amp; New York, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced at the Paris [[Opéra-Comique]] in 1966 conducted by [[Pierre Dervaux]] but with recitatives by [[Tony Aubin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb39460829g BnF archives et manuscrits], accessed 2 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and in February 2010 under [[Emmanuel Krivine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistikrezo.com/musique/Classique/opera/beatrice-et-benedict-dhector-berlioz.html Article on ''Béatrice et Bénédict''] at the Opéra-Comique in 2010, ''Artistik Rezo'', Marie Torrès, 25 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK premiere was on 24 March 1936 in Glasgow under [[Erik Chisholm]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120320150239/http://www.erikchisholm.com/ect/index.php?section_id=4 Erik Chisholm biography.] retrieved 14 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[English National Opera]] opened a production on 25 January 1990, with wife and husband [[Ann Murray]] and [[Philip Langridge]] in the title roles.&lt;ref&gt;Programme book. ''Béatrice et Bénédict'', [[English National Opera]], 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was first performed in New York in 1977 as a concert performance at [[Carnegie Hall]], [[Seiji Ozawa]] conducting the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/23/archives/music-view-when-shakespeare-hit-berlioz-like-a-thunderbolt.html "When Shakespeare Hit Berlioz Like a Thunderbolt"] by [[Harold C. Schonberg]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 23 October 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Although rather infrequently performed and not part of the standard operatic repertoire, recent productions have included Amsterdam and [[Welsh National Opera]] tour in 2001, [[Prague State Opera]] (Státní opera Praha) in 2003, [[Santa Fe Opera]] in 2004, [[Opéra du Rhin]] in Strasbourg in 2005, [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]] in 2007, [[Houston Grand Opera]] in 2008 (in English), [[Opera Boston]] in 2011, [[Theater an der Wien]] in 2013, and [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne]] in 2016. The first Swedish production of the opera was at [[Läckö Castle]] in 2015.

==Music==
The overture (sometimes played and recorded separately) alludes to several parts of the score without becoming a [[Potpourri (music)|pot-pourri]].&lt;ref name="GroveOpera" /&gt; The opera opens with a rejoicing chorus and [[Sicilienne]]. Héro has a two-part air where she looks expectantly to the return of her love, Claudio.&lt;ref name="Kobbé"&gt;[[Gustav Kobbé|Kobbé, Gustav]], [[George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood|Harewood, Earl of]]. ''Kobbé's Complete Opera Book''. Putnam, London and New York, 1954, pp. 730–733.&lt;/ref&gt; The sparring between Béatrice and Bénédict begins in the next musical number, a duo. An allegretto trio of "conspiratorial humour" for Don Pedro, Claudio and Bénédict,&lt;ref name=CairnsVol2 /&gt; consists of the latter expounding his views on marriage to which the others pass comment. After Somarone has rehearsed his [[Epithalamium#Music|Epithalame grotesque]] (a choral fugue about love), Bénédict's fast rondo reveals that he has fallen for the plot and will try to be in love. The act ends with a [[nocturne]] for Héro and Ursule – a slow duo in 6/8 which [[Walter J. Turner|W. J. Turner]] described as "a marvel of indescribable lyrical beauty"&lt;ref name="Kobbé" /&gt; and which ''Grove'' compares to "{{Lang|fr|Nuit d'ivresse}}" in ''Les Troyens''.&lt;ref name="GroveOpera" /&gt;

The second act opens with a drinking song for Somarone and chorus with guitar and tambourine prominent.&lt;ref name="GroveOpera" /&gt; Next, in an extended air across a wide melodic span, Béatrice acknowledges that she too is powerless against love and in the following trio (added after the premiere) Héro and Ursule join her to extol the joys of marriage. There is a ''{{lang|fr|marche nuptiale}}'' and the work ends with a brilliant duet marked scherzo-duettino for the title characters whose "sparkle and gaiety" end the comedy perfectly.&lt;ref name="Kobbé" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
:Time: The 16th century.
:Place: [[Messina]], [[Sicily]].

===Act 1===
[[Don (honorific)|Don]] Pedro, prince of [[Aragon]], is visiting Messina after a successful military victory over the [[Moors]], which is celebrated by all of Sicily. He is joined by two friends and fellow soldiers, Claudio and Bénédict. They are greeted by Léonato, governor of Messina, together with his daughter, Héro, and niece, Béatrice.

Héro awaits the return of her fiancé, Claudio, unwounded and rewarded for his valour. Béatrice inquires about and scorns Bénédict. They trade insults, as they have in previous meetings, and tease each other. Bénédict swears to his friends that he will never marry. Later, Claudio and Pedro scheme to trick Bénédict into marrying Béatrice. Knowing that he is listening, Léonato assures Pedro that Béatrice loves Bénédict. Upon hearing this, Bénédict resolves that Béatrice's love must not go unrequited, and so he decides to pursue her. Meanwhile, elsewhere, Héro and her attendant, Ursule, manage to play a similar trick on Béatrice who now believes that Bénédict is secretly in love with her.

===Act 2===
To celebrate the pending wedding of Claudio and Héro, Léonato hosts a [[masquerade ball|masquerade party]]. A local music teacher, Somarone, leads the group in song and everybody enjoys themselves except Béatrice who realizes that she has fallen in love with Bénédict. With Héro and Ursule she sings of the happiness of a bride about to be wed. As she turns to leave she is met by Bénédict, prompting an exchange in which they both attempt to conceal their love for each other. A notary solemnizes the marriage of Claudio and Héro, and, as arranged by Léonato, produces a second contract, asking for another couple to come forward. Bénédict summons the courage to declare his love to Beatrice; the two sign the wedding contract, and the work ends with the words "today a truce is signed, we'll be enemies again tomorrow".

== Recordings ==
