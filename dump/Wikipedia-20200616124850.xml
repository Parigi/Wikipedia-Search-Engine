The '''''hamsa''''' ({{lang-ar|خمسة}} ''khamsah''; {{lang-he-n|חַמְסָה}}, also romanized ''khamsa''; {{lang-ber|ⵜⴰⴼⵓⵙⵜ}} ''tafust'') is a palm-shaped [[amulet]] popular throughout the [[Middle East]] and in the [[Maghreb]] and commonly used in [[jewelry]] and wall hangings.&lt;ref name=Bernasekp12&gt;Bernasek et al., 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=584VAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=khamsa+%22middle+east%22+%22north+africa%22&amp;dq=khamsa+%22middle+east%22+%22north+africa%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_imrTe6mEMeSswbg7uSZCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBDgK p. 12].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sonbolp355&gt;Sonbol, 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uUe8tBUvwE4C&amp;pg=PA355&amp;dq=%22hand+of+fatima%22+evil+eye&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_NyrTaeKNsrZsgaAm9j7Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hand%20of%20fatima%22%20evil%20eye&amp;f=false pp. 355–359].&lt;/ref&gt; Depicting the open right hand, an image recognized and used as a sign of protection in many times throughout history, the ''hamsa'' is believed by some, predominantly Muslims and Jews, to provide defense against the [[evil eye]]. It has been theorized that its origins lie in Ancient Egypt or [[Carthage]] (modern-day [[Tunisia]]) and may have been associated with the Goddess [[Tanit]].&lt;ref name="Cuthbert2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuthbert|first=Roland|title=The Esoteric Codex: Amulets and Talismans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0eaJCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49|year=2015|publisher=Lulu.com|location=Raleigh, NC|isbn=978-1-329-50204-8|page=49}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}

''Khamsah'' is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word that means "five", but also "the five fingers of the hand".&lt;ref name=Zennerp284&gt;Zenner, 1988, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xsaQeU2UFpMC&amp;pg=PA284 p. 284].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WI&gt;World Institute for Advanced Phenomenological Research and Learning (Belmont, Estados Unidos), 1991, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PWPMfF-pzLQC&amp;pg=PA219 p. 219].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drazinp268&gt;Drazin, 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PerLtdiAKx0C&amp;pg=PA268 p. 268].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Hamsa'' is also variously known as the '''Hand of Fatima''' after [[Fatimah|the daughter of the prophet Muhammad]],&lt;ref name="González-Wippler1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=González-Wippler|first=Migene |title=The Complete Book of Amulets &amp; Talismans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wYd-HKmn8jUC&amp;pg=173|year=1991|publisher=Llewellyn Publications|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=978-0-87542-287-9|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; the '''Hand of Mary''', the '''Hand of Miriam''', and the '''Hand of the Goddess'''.

==History==
[[File:Collection of khamsa.jpg|thumb|Examples of Khamsa]]

Early use of the ''hamsa'' has been traced to ancient [[Mesopotamia]] (modern-day Iraq) as well as ancient [[Carthage]]{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} (modern day [[Tunisia]]). The image of the open right hand is seen in Mesopotamian artifacts in the amulets of the goddess [[Ishtar]] or [[Inanna]].&lt;ref name=Sonbolp355 /&gt; Other symbols of divine protection based around the hand include the Hand-of-Venus (or [[Aphrodite]]), the Hand-of-Mary, that was used to protect women from the evil eye and/or boost fertility and lactation, promote healthy pregnancies and strengthen the weak.&lt;ref name=Sonbolp355 /&gt; In that time, women were under immense pressure and expectation to become mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World of Child Labor|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/sharpecl/senegal|publisher=Loretta E. Bass|accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woman's upbringing was centered on becoming a mother as an exclusive role, and it indicated child bearing as necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wadud|first=Amina|title=Qur'an and Woman|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also thought that marriage was a sense of protection for both the man and the woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sechzer|first=Jeri|title="Islam and Woman: Where Tradition Meets Modernity": History and Interpretations oyt?

[[File:WPVA-khamsa.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|A drawing depicting a hamsa]]

One theory postulates a connection between the ''khamsa'' and the ''Mano Pantea'' (or Hand-of-the-All-Goddess), an amulet known to ancient Egyptians as the Two Fingers. In this amulet, the Two Fingers represent [[Isis]] and [[Osiris]] and the thumb represents their child [[Horus]]. It was used to invoke the protective spirits of parents over their child.&lt;ref name=Sonbolp355 /&gt; Another theory traces the origins of the ''hamsa'' to Carthage ([[Phoenicia]], modern [[Tunisia]]) where the hand (or in some cases [[vulva]]) of the supreme deity [[Tanit]] was used to ward off the evil eye, due to her venereal disease which caused her to have continual vaginal infections which created an offensive smell.&lt;ref name=Silverp201&gt;Silver, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gqyiX6bg0TYC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=khamsa+evil+eye&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 201].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bruno Barbatti, at that time this motive was the most important sign of [[apotropaic magic]] in the Islamic world, though many modern representations continue to show an obvious origin from sex symbolism.

This relates to the belief that God exists in everything. Another meaning of this symbol relates to the sky god, Horus. It refers to the [[Eye of Horus]], which means humans cannot escape from the eye of conscience. It says that the sun and moon are the eyes of Horus. The Hand of Fatima also represents femininity, and is referred as the woman's holy hand. It is believed to have extraordinary characteristics that can protect people from evil and other dangers.&lt;ref&gt;Lenhart, Sandy. "Hand of Fatima Meaning – Origin and Variations". Ezine Articles. N.p., n.d. Web. 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is speculated that Jews were among the first to use this amulet due to their beliefs about the [[evil eye]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Symbols'', page 70, Ellen Frankel, Betsy Platkin Teutsch. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol of the hand appears in [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] manuscripts and amulets, doubling as the [[Hebrew]] letter "[[Shin (letter)|Shin]]", the first letter of "[[El Shaddai|Shaddai]]", one of the [[Names of God in Judaism|names referring to God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=EMAIL, Jewish Magazine |url=http://jewishmag.com/144mag/superstition_magic/superstition_magic.htm |title=Angels and Demons |publisher=Jewishmag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the hamsa in Jewish culture has been intermittent, utilized often by Jews during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; then less and less over time into the mid-twentieth century. However, the notion of a protective hand has been present in Judaism dating all the way back to Biblical times, where it is referenced in Deuteronomy 5:15, stated in the Ten Commandments as the "strong hand" of God who led the Jews out of Egypt.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ''hamsa'' is later seen in Jewish art as God's hand reaching down from heaven during the times of late antiquity, the Byzantine period, and even medieval Europe. Its use by Ashkenazi Jewish communities from this period is well-known, and evidence has also emerged of the hamsa being used by Jews from medieval Spain, often associated with "sympathetic magic".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Historians such as Shalom Sabar believe that after the Jewish expulsion from Spain in 1492, exiled Jews likely used the hamsa as protection in the foreign lands they were forced to relocate to, however this assumption has been difficult to prove.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Sabar, the hamsa has also been used later by Jews in Europe "as a distinctive sign of the priesthood, especially when they wished to show that a person was of priestly descent...".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The ''khamsa'' holds recognition as a bearer of good fortune among Christians in the region as well. [[Levant]]ine Christians call it the ''hand of Mary'' (Arabic: ''Kef Miryam'', or the "[[Virgin Mary]]'s Hand").&lt;ref name=Perennialp186&gt;Perennial Books, 1970, [https://books.google.com/books?id=s3Y4AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=to+the+little-+known+fact+that+the+amulet+designated+as+the+%22hand+of+Fatima%22+is+called+by+Levantine+Christians+the+%22hand+of+Mary%22&amp;dq=to+the+little-+known+fact+that+the+amulet+designated+as+the+%22hand+of+Fatima%22+is+called+by+Levantine+Christians+the+%22hand+of+Mary%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GnU9Tp77NczHsgbL3LD5DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA p. 186].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trumballp77&gt;Trumball, 1896, [https://archive.org/details/thresholdcovena00trumgoog &lt;!-- quote="kef miryam". --&gt; p. 77].&lt;/ref&gt; 34 years after the end of Islamic rule in Spain, its use was significant enough to prompt an episcopal committee convened by [[Emperor Charles V]] to decree a ban on the Hand of Fatima and all open right hand amulets in 1526.&lt;ref name=Sonbolp355 /&gt;

==Symbolism and usage==
[[File:HamsaS.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.6|Clay hamsa with an inscription in Hebrew (translates to "good luck")]]
[[File:Amulet Spain Louvre OA3013.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Amulet with two hands of Fatimah, bearing the inscriptions "God is the guardian", "God brings consolation in all trials"]]

The Hand (''Khamsa''), particularly the open right hand, is a sign of protection that also represents blessings, power and strength, and is seen as potent in deflecting the evil eye.&lt;ref name=Sonbolp355 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rajabp116&gt;Rajab, 1989, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common components of gold and silver jewelry in the region,&lt;ref name=Badawip510 /&gt; historically and traditionally, it was most commonly carved in [[Jet (lignite)|jet]] or formed from silver, a metal believed to represent purity and hold magical properties.&lt;ref name=Sonbolp355 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lynchp8 /&gt; It is also painted in red (sometimes using the blood of a sacrificed animal) on the walls of houses for protection,&lt;ref name=Schimmelp92 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Earlyp116 /&gt; or painted or hung on the doorways of rooms, such as those of an expectant mother or new baby.&lt;ref name=Sonbolp355 /&gt; The hand can be depicted with the fingers spread apart to ward off evil, or as closed together to bring good luck.&lt;ref name=Gomezp54 /&gt; Similarly, it can be portrayed with the fingers pointing up in warding, or down to bestow blessings. Highly stylized versions may be difficult to recognize as hands, and can consist of five circles representing the fingers, situated around a central circle representing the palm.&lt;ref name=Gomezp54&gt;Gomez, 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbH5XYWiiy0C&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=stylized+khamsa&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eyMCTuS2NtOr8APvqvGwDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=stylized%20khamsa&amp;f=false p. 54].&lt;/ref&gt;

Used to protect against evil eye, a malicious stare believed to be able to cause illness, death or just general unluckiness, hamsas often contain an eye symbol.&lt;ref name=Lynchp8&gt;Lynch and Roberts, 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Qiq4ps_wDIC&amp;pg=PT34&amp;dq=khamsa+hand&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#v=onepage&amp;q=khamsa%20hand&amp;f=false p. 8].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hamp385 /&gt; Depictions of the hand, the eye or the number five in Arabic (and [[Berber people|Berber]]) tradition are related to warding off the evil eye, as exemplified in the saying ''khamsa fi ainek'' ("five [fingers] in your eye").&lt;ref name=Hamp385&gt;Ham and Bing, 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V_IMx-YYvJYC&amp;pg=PA385&amp;dq=khamsa+evil+eye#v=onepage&amp;q=khamsa%20evil%20eye&amp;f=false p. 385].&lt;/ref&gt; Raising one's right hand with the palm showing and the fingers slightly apart is part of this curse meant "to blind the aggressor".&lt;ref name=Schimmelp92&gt;Schimmel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vrlwo4OqvWgC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=%22hand+of+fatima%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BDSrTZ_nKoj0sgas2KiOCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hand%20of%20fatima%22&amp;f=false p. 92].&lt;/ref&gt; Another formula uttered against the evil eye in Arabic, but without hand gestures, is ''khamsa wa-khamis'' ("five and Thursday").&lt;ref name=Lentp169&gt;Lent et al., 1996, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shinarp117&gt;Shinar, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1huFh8xcpLEC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=khamsa+fish+hand&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OO4zTtqxOofTsgaN9um6Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=khamsa%20fish%20hand&amp;f=false p. 117].&lt;/ref&gt; As the fifth day of the week, Thursday is considered a good day for magic rites and pilgrimages to the tombs of revered saints to counteract the effects of the evil eye.&lt;ref name="Houtsmap897"&gt;Houtsma, 1993, p. 897.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its significance in both Arabic and Berber culture, the ''hamsa'' is one of the national symbols of [[Algeria]] and appears in its [[emblem of Algeria|emblem]]. It is also the most popular among the different [[amulet]]s (such as the Eye and the ''Hirz''—a silver box containing verses of the [[Quran]]) for warding off the evil eye in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=Badawip510&gt;Badawi, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ojiQTtPEFckC&amp;pg=PA510&amp;dq=khamsa+evil+eye&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=khamsa%20evil%20eye&amp;f=false p. 510].&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian women who live in ''baladi'' ("traditional") urban quarters often make ''khamaysa'', which are amulets made up of five (''khamsa'') objects to attach to their children's hair or black aprons. The five objects can be made of peppers, hands, circles or stars hanging from hooks.&lt;ref name=Earlyp116&gt;Early, 1993, [https://archive.org/details/baladiwomenofcai00earl/page/116 &lt;!-- quote=khamsa in your eye. --&gt; p. 116]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although significant in Arabic and Berber culture, the Jewish people have long interpreted and adopted the symbol of the hand with great importance since the Ten Commandments. A portion of these commandments state that "Lord took Israel out of Egypt with a strong hand and an outstretched arm".&lt;ref&gt;Sabar, Shalom ''From Sacred Symbol to Key Ring: The Hamsa in Jewish and Israeli Societies, 141''&lt;/ref&gt; The "strong hand" is representative of the hamsa which rooted its relevance in the community then. The helping hand exemplified God's willingness to help his people and direct them out of struggle. Around the time of the Byzantine period, artists would depict God's hand reaching from up above.&lt;ref&gt;Sabar, Shalom ''From Sacred Symbol to Key Ring, 142''&lt;/ref&gt; God's hand from heaven would lead the Jewish people out of struggle, and the Jews quickly made a connection with the hamsa and their culture. The hand was identified in Jewish text, and acquired as an influential icon throughout the community.

Amongst the Jewish people, the ''hamsa'' is a very respected, holy, and common symbol. It is used in the ''Ketubah'', or marriage contracts, as well as items that dress the Torah such as pointers, and the Passover [[Haggadah]].&lt;ref&gt;Sabar, Shalom ''From Sacred Symbol to Key Ring, 144''&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the hand as images both in and out of the synagogue suggests the importance and relevance that the Jewish people associated with the hamsa. The hand decorated some of the most religious and divine objects and has since emerged from its uncommon phase.

At the time of the establishment of the [[Israel|State of Israel]], the hamsa became a symbol in everyday Israeli life, and to a degree, a symbol of Israel itself.&lt;ref name=Nockep133&gt;Nocke, 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=z1EWdLtg4sAC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=hamsa+%22evil+eye%22+%22middle+east%22+%22north+africa%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5R2rTcjMNorFswbs4rnzCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hamsa%20%22evil%20eye%22%20%22middle%20east%22%20%22north%20africa%22&amp;f=false pp. 133–134].&lt;/ref&gt; It has come to be a symbol of secularity, and a trendy talisman; a "good luck" charm appearing on necklaces, keychains, postcards, telephone and lottery cards, and in advertisements. It is also a commonly used symbol by Jews outside of the Middle East, particularly in Jewish communities of the United States.&lt;ref name=Nockep133 /&gt; It is also incorporated into high-end jewellery, decorative tilework and wall decorations.&lt;ref name=Nockep133 /&gt; 

Similar to the Western use of the phrase "knock on wood" or "touch wood", a common expression in Israel is "Hamsa, Hamsa, Hamsa, tfu, tfu, tfu", the sound for spitting, supposedly to spit out bad luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/correspondents/content/2010/s2906608.htm |title=Jewish magic and superstition in Israel |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2010-05-22 |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Mimouna]], a [[Maghrebi Jewish]] celebration held after [[Passover]], tables are laid with various symbols of luck and fertility, with an emphasis on the number "5", such as five pieces of gold jewelry or five beans arranged on a leaf of pastry. The repetition of the number five is associated with the hamsa amulet.&lt;ref name="luck"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/lady-luck-1.217597 |last=Bin-Nun |first=Yigal |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=8 April 2007 |accessdate=21 June 2011|title=Lady Luck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Morocco, the ''Hamsa'' is called 'Khamsa' or 'Khmisa' and is widely used as a protection from bad luck and evil people. The ''Hamsa'' is incorporated in many home decor items, but still, the most common use is in jewelry. In fact, most Moroccan women have at least one jewelry piece with a ''Hamsa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://moroccanzest.com/morocco-jewelry/|title=Moroccan Jewelry|last=|first=|date=2018-08-22|website=Moroccan Zest|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Native American [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]] also contained images of a human hand with an eye in the palm. However, the meaning and purpose are unconfirmed.
