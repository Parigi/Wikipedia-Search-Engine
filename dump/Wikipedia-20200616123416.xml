The '''Apple Computer 1''', originally released as the '''Apple Computer''', also known later as the '''Apple I''', or '''Apple-1''', is a [[desktop computer]] released by the Apple Computer Company (now [[Apple Inc.]]) in 1976. It was designed and [[Handicraft|hand-built]] by [[Steve Wozniak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.oneindia.in/2006/09/27/co-founder-tells-his-side-of-apple-story-1159346150.html |title=Co-founder tells his side of Apple story |work=Reuters |date=September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6167297|title=A Chat with Computing Pioneer Steve Wozniak|author=|date=|website=npr.org|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of selling the computer came from Wozniak's friend [[Steve Jobs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Owen W. |last=Linzmayer |year=2004 |title=Apple Confidential 2.0: The Definitive History of the World's Most Colorful Company |url=https://archive.org/details/appleconfidentia00linz_028 |url-access=limited |publisher=No Starch Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/appleconfidentia00linz_028/page/n16 5]|isbn=9781593270100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Jason D. |last=O'Grady |year=2009 |title=Apple Inc. |url=https://archive.org/details/appleinccorporat00ogra_138 |url-access=limited |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=[https://archive.org/details/appleinccorporat00ogra_138/page/n17 3]|isbn=9780313362446}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Apple I was Apple's first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation, a [[Volkswagen Type 2|VW Microbus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/2011/aug/30/kelley-jobs-vision-changed-the-way-we-work-play/?opinion=1|title=Ventura County Star|author=|date=|website=Ventura County Star|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a few hundred dollars (Wozniak later said that Jobs planned instead to use his bicycle to get around), and Wozniak sold his [[HP-65]] calculator for $500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groovypost.com/news/steve-jobs-steve-wozniak-remembers/|title=Steve Jobs: Steve Wozniak Remembers|author=|date=|website=www.groovypost.com|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wozniak demonstrated the first prototype in July 1976 at the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], California.&lt;ref name = "Freiberger 2000"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Freiberger | first1 = Paul | authorlink1 = Paul Freiberger | first2 = Michael | last2 = Swaine | authorlink2 = Michael Swaine (technical author) | title = Fire in the Valley: The Making of the Personal Computer | publisher = McGraw-Hill | edition = 2nd | year = 2000 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/fireinvalleymaki00frei_0/page/265 265–267] | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-07-135892-7 | quote = At a Homebrew meeting in July 1976, Woz gave a demonstration of the Apple 1.

==History==
[[File:Apple 1 Advertisement Oct 1976.jpg|thumb|left|Introductory advertisement for the Apple I computer]]
On March 5, 1975, Steve Wozniak attended the first meeting of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] in Gordon French's garage. He was so inspired that he immediately set to work on what would become the Apple I computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wozniak |first=Steve |title=iWoz |url=https://archive.org/details/iwozcomputergeek00wozn |url-access=registration |year=2006 |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company |isbn=978-0-393-33043-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/iwozcomputergeek00wozn/page/150 150]|quote=After my first meeting, I started designing the computer that would later be known as the Apple I. It was that inspiring.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After building it for himself and showing it at the Club, he and Steve Jobs gave out schematics (technical designs) for the computer to interested club members and even helped some of them build and test out copies. Then, Steve Jobs suggested that they design and sell a single etched and silkscreened circuit board&amp;mdash;just the bare board, with no electronic parts&amp;mdash;that people could use to build the computers. Wozniak calculated that having the board design laid out would cost $1,000 and manufacturing would cost another $20 per board; he hoped to recoup his costs if 50 people bought the boards for $40 each. To fund this small venture&amp;mdash;their first company&amp;mdash;Jobs sold his van and Wozniak sold his [[HP-65]] calculator. Very soon after, Steve Jobs arranged to sell "something like 50" completely built computers to the [[Paul Terrell|Byte Shop]] (a computer store in Mountain View, California) at $500 each. To fulfill the $25,000 order, they obtained $20,000 in parts at [[Net D|30 days net]] and delivered the finished product in 10 days.&lt;ref name="wozniak198412"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-12/1984_12_BYTE_09-13_Communications#page/n461/mode/2up | title=The Apple Story / Part 1: Early History | work=BYTE | date=December 1984 | accessdate=October 23, 2013 |author1=Williams, Gregg |author2=Moore, Rob | pages=A67 | type=interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 at a price of {{USD|666.66}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/1606-2-5937610.html|title=Video: Wozniak: $500.66 seemed like a good idea|date=November 7, 2005|publisher=CNET News|accessdate=February 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; because Wozniak "liked repeating digits" and because of a one-third markup on the $500 wholesale price.&lt;ref name="iWoz"&gt;[[Steve Wozniak|Wozniak, Steven]]: "[[iWoz]]", page 180. [[W. W. Norton]], 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-393-06143-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first unit produced was used in a high school math class, and donated to [[Liza Loop]]'s public-access computer center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turner|first1=Daniel|title=MIT Technology Review|journal=MIT Technology Review|date=May 1, 2007|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/hack/407810/hack-the-apple-i/|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 200 units were produced, and all but 25 were sold within nine or ten months.&lt;ref name="wozniak198412" /&gt;

The Apple I's built-in [[computer terminal]] circuitry was distinctive. All one needed was a [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] and a [[television set]]. Competing machines such as the [[Altair 8800]] generally were programmed with front-mounted toggle switches and used indicator lights (red [[light-emitting diode|LEDs]], most commonly) for output, and had to be extended with separate hardware to allow connection to a computer terminal or a [[Teletype Model 33|teletypewriter machine]]. This made the Apple I an innovative machine for its day. In April 1977, the price was dropped to $475.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.applefritter.com/node/2703|title=April 1977 Price List - Applefritter|author=|date=|website=www.applefritter.com|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continued to be sold through August 1977, despite the introduction of the [[Apple II]] in April 1977, which began shipping in June of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.applefritter.com/node/2715|title=Bill of Sale - Applefritter|author=|date=|website=www.applefritter.com|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1977, the Apple I was officially discontinued and removed from Apple's price list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.applefritter.com/node/2707|title=October 1977 Price List - Applefritter|author=|date=|website=www.applefritter.com|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Wozniak was the only person who could answer most customer support questions about the computer, the company offered Apple I owners discounts and trade-ins for Apple IIs to persuade them to return their computers.&lt;ref name="ah04"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah04/ | title=The Apple II, cont. | accessdate=February 27, 2011 | work=Apple II History}}&lt;/ref&gt; These recovered boards were then destroyed by Apple, contributing to their rarity today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.apple1notes.com/old_apple/Huston_Stories_files/A1%20Back%20Story.htm | title=The Huston brothers' Apple-1 Back Story | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, sixty-three Apple I computers have been confirmed to exist.  Only six have been verified to be in working condition.

* An Apple I reportedly sold for US$50,000 at auction in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ong|first=Josh|title=Auction of Apple's first computer expected to top $160k|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/11/11/auction_of_apples_first_computer_expected_to_top_160k.html|publisher=Apple Insider|accessdate=June 16, 2012|date=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2008, the website ''Vintage Computing and Gaming'' reported that Apple I owner Rick Conte was looking to sell his unit and was "expecting a price in excess of $15,000 U.S."  The site later reported Conte had donated the unit to the Maine Personal Computer Museum in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Edwards|first=Benj|date=September 15, 2008|title=Apple I For Sale|url=http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/499|url-status=live|work=Vintage Computing and Gaming|accessdate=April 1, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314062620/http://vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/499|archivedate=March 14, 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In November 2010, an Apple I sold for £133,250 ($210,000) at [[Christie's]] auction house in London. The high price was likely due to the rare documents and packaging offered in the sale in addition to the computer, including the original packaging (with the return label showing Steve Jobs' parents' address, the original Apple Computer Inc "headquarters" being their garage), a personally typed and signed letter from Jobs (answering technical questions about the computer), and the original invoice showing "Steven" as the salesman. The computer was brought to [[Polytechnic University of Turin]] where it was fixed and used to run the [[BASIC]] programming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BBC News|title=First Apple computer fetches £130,000 at auction|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11825954|work=BBC News|accessdate=June 16, 2012|date=November 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christie's Sale 7882 / Lot 65|url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5370965&amp;sid=1d221fae-dbba-4746-9922-8ca3e066b4bf|publisher=Christie's|accessdate=June 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heater|first=Brian|title=$211,000 Apple-1 up and running, wants to know what this 'cloud' thing is all about|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/05/10/211-000-apple-1-up-and-running-wants-to-know-what-this-cloud/|work=engadget|publisher=engadget.com|accessdate=June 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On November 24, 2012, a working Apple I was sold at auction by Auction Team Breker for €400,000 (US$515,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=the-saleroom.com |url=http://www.the-saleroom.com/en-gb/auction-catalogues/auction-team-breker/catalogue-id-2869018/lot-15886115 |publisher=ATG Media |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128213407/http://www.the-saleroom.com/en-gb/auction-catalogues/auction-team-breker/catalogue-id-2869018/lot-15886115 |archivedate=November 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On May 25, 2013, a functioning 1976 model was sold for a then-record €516,000 (US$668,000) in [[Cologne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/working-apple-1-sells-at-auction-for-record-breaking-671400/|title=How much?!

*On June 24, 2013, an Apple I was listed by Christie's as part of a special online-only auction lot called "First Bytes: Iconic Technology From the Twentieth Century." Bidding ran through July 9, 2013. The unit sold for $390,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Apple Computer Sells for $390,000 in Christie’s Technology Auction|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/488167/20130709/apple-1-computer-sold-auction-online-technology.htm|website=International Business Times|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple I auction fails to break 500K|url=http://macmint.com/apple-1-auction-fails-to-break-500k|publisher=Macmint|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In November 2013, a working unit speculated to have been part of the original lot of 50 boards delivered to the Byte Shop was listed by Auction Team Breker for €180,000 ($242,820), but failed to sell during the auction. Immediately following the close of bidding, a private collector purchased it for €246,000 ($330,000). This board was marked "01-0046," matching the numbering placed on other units sold to the Byte Shop and included the original operation manuals, software cassettes, and shipping box autographed by Steve Wozniak.

*On December 13, 2014, a fully functioning, early Apple I was sold at auction for $365,000 by auction house [[Christie's]]. The sale included a keyboard, custom case, original manual and a check labeled "Purchased July 1976 from [[Steve Jobs]] in his parents' garage in [[Los Altos, California|Los Altos]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Computer sold by Steve Jobs out of his parents' garage raises $365,000 at auction|url=https://news.yahoo.com/computer-sold-steve-jobs-parents-115801772.html|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=December 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On May 30, 2015, a woman reportedly dropped off boxes of electronics for disposal at an [[Computer recycling|electronics recycling center]] in the [[Silicon Valley]] of Northern California, and they would now like to contact her. Included in the items removed from her garage after the death of her husband was an original Apple I computer, which the recycling firm sold for $200,000 to a private collector. It is the company's practice to give back 50% of the proceeds to the original owner when an item is sold, so they want to find the mystery donor.&lt;ref name=Cbs2015-05-30/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cbc2015-05-31/&gt;
*On September 21, 2015, an Apple I bearing the Byte Shop number 01-0059 was listed by Bonhams Auctions as part of their "History of Science and Technology" auction with a starting bid of US$300,000. The machine was described as, "in near perfect condition."

==Serial numbers==
Both Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak have stated that Apple did not assign serial numbers to the Apple l. Several boards have been found with numbered stickers affixed to them, which appear to be inspection stickers from the PCB manufacturer/assembler. A batch of boards is known to have numbers hand-written in black permanent marker on the back; these usually appear as "01-00##" and anecdotal evidence suggests they are inventory control numbers added by the Byte Shop to the batch Apple sold them. These Byte Shop numbers have often erroneously been described as serial numbers by auction houses and in related press coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Apple 1 Registry|url=http://www.willegal.net/appleii/apple1-originals.htm|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
