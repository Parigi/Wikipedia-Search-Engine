[[File:Manifestacionpuertasolmadrid23.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstration against the crisis and high youth unemployment in Madrid, 15 May 2011.]]
The '''2008–2014 Spanish financial crisis''', also known as the '''Great Recession in Spain'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eco.uc3m.es/temp/dolado2/EJ_2012_FRvsSP_BCDL.pdf|title=TWO-TIER LABOUR MARKETS IN THE GREAT RECESSION: FRANCE VERSUS SPAIN|work=The Economic Journal|date=2012|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europeansnapshot.com/spain/|title=Spain: Still in the Throes of the Great Recession – The Spanish Economy Sinks Further|work=European Economic Snapshot}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Great Spanish Depression''', began in 2008 during the world [[financial crisis of 2007–08]]. In 2012, it made [[Spain]] a late participant in the [[European sovereign debt crisis]] when the country was unable to bail out its financial sector and had to apply for a €100 billion rescue package provided by the [[European Stability Mechanism]] (ESM).

The main cause of Spain's crisis was the [[housing bubble]] and the accompanying unsustainably high GDP growth rate.  The ballooning tax revenues from the booming property investment and construction sectors kept the Spanish government's revenue in surplus, despite strong increases in expenditure, until 2007.&lt;ref name=cato20120531&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/looking-at-austerity-in-spain/|title=Looking at Austerity in Spain|date=31 May 2012|author=Juan Carlos Hidalgo|publisher=Cato Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish government supported the critical development by relaxing supervision of the financial sector and thereby allowing the banks to violate [[International Accounting Standards Board]] standards.{{when|date=August 2015}}{{how|date=August 2015}}{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}.

Even though some fundamental problems in the Spanish economy were already evident far ahead of the crisis, Spain continued the path of unsustainable property led growth when the [[2004 Spanish general election|ruling party changed in 2004]]. In these early times Spain had already a huge [[Balance of trade|trade deficit]],&lt;ref name="Abellán2008"&gt;{{Citation

The provision of up to €100 billion of rescue loans from eurozone funds was agreed by eurozone finance ministers on 9 June 2012.&lt;ref name="BBC-9JUN"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18382659|title=Spanish banks to get up to 100bn euros in rescue loans |work =BBC News|date=9 June 2012|accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2012, the so-called Troika ([[European Commission]], [[European Central Bank|ECB]] and [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]) is in negotiations with Spain to establish an economic recovery program required for providing additional financial loans from [[European Stability Mechanism|ESM]].

The turning point for the Spanish sovereign debt crisis occurred on 26 July 2012, when ECB President [[Mario Draghi]] said that the ECB was "ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro". Announced on 6 September 2012, the ECB's [[Outright Monetary Transactions]] (OMT) program of unlimited purchases of short-term sovereign debt put the ECB's balance sheet behind the pledge. [[Speculative attack|Speculative runs]] against Spanish sovereign debt were discouraged and 10-year bond yields stayed below the 6% level, approaching the 5% level by the end of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323300404578205580657203900 |title=How Europe's Currency Survived 2012 Intact |date=28 September 2012 | work=Wall Street Journal|author=Stephen Fidler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/world-week/21568775-world-year| title=The world this year|date=22 December 2012| work =The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/business/cwkfqlqleyoj/rss2/|title=Europe calmed by firm hand on edge of the abyss|author=Kyran Fitzgerald|date=22 December 2012| work =Irish Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Property bubble==
{{Main|Spanish property bubble}}
The residential real estate bubble saw [[Real estate pricing|real estate prices]] rise 200% from 1996 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.spainrei.com/MiV-Spain-Property-Prices-95-07-yearly.htm |title="According to the Spanish Ministry of Housing"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=27 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416102402/http://www.spainrei.com/MiV-Spain-Property-Prices-95-07-yearly.htm |archive-date=16 April 2009 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC20120518&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17753891|title=Spanish economy: What is to blame for its problems?|author=Laurence Knight|date=18 May 2012|  work =BBC news}}&lt;/ref&gt;

€651 billion was the mortgage debt of Spanish families in the second quarter of 2005 (this debt continued to grow at 25% per year – 2001 through 2005, with 97% of mortgages at [[variable rate]] interest).{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} In 2004, 509,293 new properties were built in Spain and in 2005 the number of new properties built was 528,754.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mviv.es/es/xls/estadisticas/parque/pv21.XLS "Number of new properties according to the Ministry of Housing in Spain"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a country with 16.5 million families, there were 22–24 million houses and 3–4 million empty houses.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} From all the houses built over the 2001–2007 period, "no less than 28%" were vacant as of late 2008.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elconfidencial.com/mercados/archivo/2008/08/28/noticias_50_900000_viviendas_construidas_inmobiliario_estan.html|title=Más de 900.000 viviendas construidas en los años del ‘boom’ inmobiliario están vacías - Cotizalia.com|website=www.elconfidencial.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

House ownership in Spain is above 80%.&lt;ref name=NYT20120828&gt;{{cite news|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/spain/index.html|title=Spain|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=30 August 2012|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The desire to own one's own home was encouraged by governments in the 60s and 70s, and has thus become part of the Spanish psyche. In addition, tax regulation encourages ownership: 15% of mortgage payments are deductible from personal income taxes. Even more, the oldest apartments are controlled by non-inflation-adjusted rent-controls&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jubilo.es/asp/pagina.asp?IDPagina=3360 |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011230256/http://jubilo.es/asp/pagina.asp?IDPagina=3360 |archive-date=11 October 2007 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and eviction is slow, therefore discouraging renting.

When the [[Economic bubble|speculative bubble]] popped Spain became one of the worst affected countries. According to [[Eurostat]], between June 2007 and June 2008, Spain has been the European country with the sharpest plunge in construction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/elpaismedia/ultimahora/media/200808/20/espana/20080820elpepunac_1_Pes_PDF.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=27 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320111018/http://www.elpais.com/elpaismedia/ultimahora/media/200808/20/espana/20080820elpepunac_1_Pes_PDF.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; with actual sales down an average 25.3%. So far, some regions have been more affected than others ([[Catalonia]] was ahead in this regard with a 42.2% sales plunge while sparsely populated regions like [[Extremadura]] were down a mere 1.7% over the same period).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.es/lv24h/20080923/53544998493.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20080926014804/http://www.lavanguardia.es/lv24h/20080923/53544998493.html|archivedate=26 September 2008|url-status=dead|title=La venta de viviendas cae un 42% en Catalunya en un año, el mayor porcentaje del Estado|access-date=27 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banks offered 40-year mortgages and, more recently, 50-year [[mortgage loan|mortgage]]s. While some observers suggest that a soft landing will occur, others suggest that a crash in prices is probable. Lower home prices will allow low-income families and young people to enter the market; however, there is a strong perception that house prices never go down. As of August 2008, while new constructions have come virtually to a halt, prices have not had significant movements, neither up nor downwards. The national average price as of late 2008 is 2,095 euros/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Housing prices
were projected to fall another 25%. Government protections allow banks to avoid marking-to-market to postpone losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://www.aei.org/events/2012/07/19/europe-on-the-brink-how-should-the-us-engage/|people=Mickey Levy, Chief Economist, Bank of America|title=Europe on the brink: How should the US engage?|publisher=American Enterprise Institute|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Spanish housing prices are now falling at the fastest pace on record" dropping 15.2% over the last year.&lt;ref name=WSJ20121214&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323981504578179270357838436|title=Fall in Spain's House Prices Steepens|date=14 December 2012|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|author=Art Patnaude}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortgage holders must continue to pay the debt even after a foreclosure. Banks have begun to accept "[[deed-in-lieu]] deals" in which the debt is cancelled if the property is surrendered, allowing the bank to quickly sell and recoup a greater percentage of the loan or turn the property into a rental.&lt;ref name=WSJ20121214 /&gt;

Some developments resemble [[ghost town]]s. For instance, the town of Valdeluz was constructed for 30,000 people, but had a population of only 700 people in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/spain-ghost-towns-satellite-2011-4|title=Amazing Satellite Images Of Spanish Ghost Towns -- Abandoned Since The Crash|first=Gus Lubin, Leah|last=Goldman|website=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghost airports such as €1.1 billion [[Ciudad Real Central Airport]], [[Castellón-Costa Azahar Airport]] and others were built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harter|first=Pascale|title=The white elephants that dragged Spain into the red|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18855961|accessdate=27 July 2012|newspaper=BBC News Magazine|date=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt20120719&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/19/world/europe/in-spain-a-symbol-of-ruin-at-an-airport-to-nowhere.html |title=In Spain, a Symbol of Ruin at an Airport to Nowhere | work =[[The New York Times]] |date=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prices==
Due to the lack of its own resources, Spain has to import all of its [[fossil fuel]]s, which in a [[2000s energy crisis|scenario of record prices]] added much pressure to the inflation rate. Thus, in June 2008 the inflation rate reached a 13-year high of 5.00%. Then, with the [[2003 to 2008 world oil market chronology#Mid-Late 2008 decreases|dramatic decrease of oil prices]] that happened in the second half of 2008 plus the confirmed burst of the property bubble, concerns quickly shifted to the risk of [[deflation]] instead, as Spain registered in January 2009 its lowest inflation rate in 40 years which was then followed in March 2009 by a negative inflation rate for the first time ever since this statistic was recorded.&lt;ref name=Reuters2009&gt;{{Citation

As of October 2010, the Spanish economy has continued to contract, resulting in decreasing GDP and increasing inflation.  From 2011 to 2012 alone, prices rose 3.5% as compared to 2% in the United States. The rise in prices, combined with the recently implemented austerity measures and extremely high unemployment, are heavily impacting the livelihood of Spanish citizens.  As the average wage decreases, the [[buying power]] of the money decreases as well. The frustration of this decreases in buying power has manifested in several, very large, worker demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.socialistworld.net/doc/3569 |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129051304/http://www.socialistworld.net/doc/3569 |archive-date=29 January 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish banking system==
{{Further|Savings bank (Spain)}}
The Spanish banking system had been credited as one of the most solid and best equipped among all Western economies to cope with the worldwide [[liquidity crisis]], thanks to the country's conservative banking rules and practices. Banks are required to have high capital provisions and demand various proofs and securities from intending borrowers. Nevertheless, this practice was greatly relaxed during the housing bubble, a trend to which the regulator ([[Banco de España]]) turned a blind eye.

Spain's unusual accounting standards, intended to smooth earnings over the business cycle, have misled regulators and analysts by hiding losses and earnings volatility. The accounting technique of "dynamic provisioning", which violated the standards set by the International Accounting Standards Board, obscured capital cushions until they were depleted, allowing the appearance of health as problems mounted.&lt;ref name=bloomberg20120614 /&gt;

It was later revealed that nearly all the Spanish representatives in Congress had large investments in the housing sector, some owning up to twenty houses.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Over time, more and more news has emerged about the informal alliance between Spanish central and regional governments, the banking sector (bear in mind for example the recent government pardon of the second in command at the [[Santander Group|Santander Bank]], while all the major parties are strongly indebted with banks, and such debts are extended from time to time) which increased the bubble size over the years. Most [[Savings bank (Spain)|regional semi-public savings banks (''cajas'')]] lent heavily to real estate companies that at the end of the bubble went bankrupt, then the ''cajas'' found themselves left with the collateral and properties of those companies, namely overpriced real state and residential-zoned land, now worthless, rendering the ''cajas'' in essence bankrupt.

In stark contrast to countries like Ireland, no nationalization took place. Instead the problem was rolled-over with the extension of the remaining real estate companies debts, while the central government bailed once and again banks and cajas alike. For more than three years, there has been a steady process of bank concentration.  Spain had the densest bank-office net in Europe, which led many bank employees to be dismissed. By contrast, the bank Board of Members have mostly kept their jobs, even those in merged entities. [[Golden parachutes]] have been prevalent: it has been speculated that this was because of fear that laid-off senior members would talk about the sector's rampant malpractice.  To this date no bankers have been legally charged for having roles in this process.

In May 2012 [[credit rating]]s of several Spanish banks were downgraded, some to "junk" status. The [[Bankia]] bank, the country's largest [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] lender, was nationalized on 9 May, and on 25 May it announced that it would require a bailout of €23.5 billion to cover losses from failed mortgages.&lt;ref name="NYT-May12"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/26/business/global/spanish-lender-seeks-state-aid-ratings-cut-on-5-banks.html |title=Spanish Lender Seeks 19 Billion Euros; Ratings Cut on 5 Banks |author= Raphael Minder |date=25 May 2012 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Spanish banks, other European banks have a sizable presence in Spain. German banks lead with an exposure of $146 billion. Germany's [[Landesbank]]s "rushed in" during the early 2000s. [[Barclays]], [[Deutsche Bank]], and [[ING Group|ING]] have large Spanish units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303649504577492882666014186|title=European Banks Are Facing More Pain in Spain|author=Sara Schaefer Munoz and Laua Stevens |date=27 June 2012| work =Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443890304578008534178895560 |title=State of Europe's Banks: Safe and Stressed|date=24 September 2012|author=Laura Stevens and Eyk Henning| work =Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 June 2012 Eurozone finance ministers agreed that Spanish banks would be provided with up to €100 billion of rescue loans. This money is to be distributed via the [[Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring]], and that the exact amount to be loaned would be determined after audits of the banks. EC President [[Jose Manuel Barroso]] and vice-president [[Olli Rehn]] welcomed the move, praising the combination of a "thorough restructuring of the banking sector", structural reforms, and fiscal consolidation; U.S. Treasury Secretary [[Timothy Geithner]] also welcomed the move.&lt;ref name="BBC-9JUN"/&gt;

Recent [[Stress test (financial)|bank stress tests]] will enable the Spanish government to make a formal request for the €100 billion credit line. Further analysis and tests will be undertaken prior to restructuring and recapitalization over the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.cnbc.com/id/48076809|title=Spanish Banks' Tale of Woe to Drag On| author=Victor Mallet and Patrick Jenkins | work =CNBC |date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions on the credit line exempting funds from covering "legacy assets" suggests limits to the planned banking bailouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9569353/Spains-crisis-flares-again-as-AAA-club-scuppers-bank-rescue-deal.html |title= Spain's crisis flares again as AAA club scuppers bank rescue deal| author= Ambrose Evans-Pritchard |date=28 September 2012| work =UK Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, Spanish banks lent €1.66 trillion to the private sector and took in €896 billion. Historically it would borrow the difference from foreign banks (i.e., [[Interbank lending market|interbank lending]]) but reduced access has led to a greater reliance on ECB loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303919504577524482252510066 |title=Euro-Zone Banks Cut Back Lending: ECB Loans to Spain Soar, as Germany Pulls Back, Underlying Risks to South |date=14 July 2012 |author=Charles Forelle and David Enrich | work =Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish banks borrowed a record €376 billion (net) from the [[European Central Bank|ECB]] in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-08-14/spanish-banks-ecb-loans-rise-as-rajoy-mulls-second-bailout-call|title=Spanish Banks' ECB Loans Rise as Rajoy Mulls Second Bailout Call | work =Bloomberg Business|date=14 August 2012|author=Ben Sills}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depositors are fleeing Spanish banks; deposits have dropped 4.7% from June to July (2012) as money is moved abroad.&lt;ref name=UKT20120928&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444813104578016182740070640|title=Nordic Banks Gain New Status: Haven|author=Gustav Sandstrom|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November 2012, the [[European Commission]] approved the [[Government of Spain|Spanish government]]'s plan to shrink and restructure three major Spanish banks—[[Bankia]], [[NCG Banco]], and [[Catalunya Banc]]—and sell a fourth, [[Banco de Valencia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20523753|title=Spain banks to cut jobs and shrink in restructuring|date=28 November 2012|newspaper=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is part of a €37 billion EC bailout or restructuring approved in June.

==Employment crisis==
After having completed substantial improvements over the second half of the 1990s and during the 2000s, which put a few regions on the brink of [[full employment]], Spain suffered a severe setback in October 2008, when it saw its unemployment rate surging to 1996 levels. Between October 2007 and October 2008, Spain had its unemployment rate climb 36%, exceeding by far the unemployment surge of past economic crises like 1993. In particular, in October 2008, Spain suffered its worst unemployment rise ever recorded and,&lt;ref name=ElPais20081104&gt;{{Citation

Spain's unemployment rate hit 17.4% at the end of March 2009, with the jobless total now having doubled over the past 12 months, when two million people lost their jobs.&lt;ref name=BBC2009joblessrate&gt;{{Citation |date = 24 April 2009 | accessdate =2 May 2009 | title = Spain's jobless rate soars to 17% | work =BBC News | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8016364.stm

In 2012, unions organized a general strike to protest proposals to weaken union power, enable cuts in wages, and lower firing costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-03-28/spanish-general-strike-looms-as-rajoy-cornered-by-deficit-crisis |title=Spain Vows to Resist Strikers' Demands to Reverse Labor Law|author= Emma Ross-Thomas |date=20 March 2012| work =Businessweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2012, Spain's unit labor costs improved. It narrowed the gap with Germany by 5.5% and 4.6% with respect to France. Spain's policy of ''[[internal devaluation]]'' cut public sector salaries by 5% with an additional 7.1% cut consisting of a suspension of the "14-month bonus".

Spain, as in other southern European nations, relies heavily on the inter-generational family structure for a significant portion of the social safety net. Employment expectations should be adjusted for this cultural ethos. The unemployment rate for the "principal breadwinner" is 12.4% less than the 25% overall rate (June 2012.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303734204577466962276816888?mod=WSJ_hps_editorsPicks_1|title=The Nonna State|date=15 June 2012|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|author=Alessandra Galloni}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employment is also found in the underground economy, which is estimated to be as large as 20% of the economy during the boom years.&lt;ref name=NYT20120828/&gt;

===Youth unemployment===
[[File:Manifa1.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstration against labor market reforms, [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]], March 2012]]
Unemployment for those under 25 has been reported to be 50%. Spain's current generation is considered the most educated that the country has ever had, yet it faces the greatest rate of unemployment in Europe. Roughly 68% of young people are willing to leave the country to search for a job, and those with college degrees are willing to settle for working at so-called [[Marginal employment|minijobs]] for a paycheck. The State Secretary for Unemployment states that higher education is a way for the current generation to battle this issue; however, government cuts are occurring that slash university staff salaries and increase the number of students per class. For those paying their own way through college, the tough economy has made it nearly impossible to find a job and study simultaneously.  Hopes for the future are dwindling as Spain's unemployment rate is almost as high as it was for the United States during the [[Great Depression]]. People are beginning to fear the transformation of this generation into one referred to as a "[[Lost Generation]]" that is constantly looking for work and whose futures are closed off from "good careers". The stress of unemployment has also affected personal relationships, with many young adults separating from partners. Youth unemployment is about double overall unemployment.&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/desperation-anger-grows-for-spanish-youth-with-51-percent-unemployed/|title=Desperation, anger grows for Spanish youth, with 51 percent unemployed|website=www.cbsnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-05-02/markets/31525945_1_unemployment-rate-spain-unemployment-eurozone |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503212954/http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-05-02/markets/31525945_1_unemployment-rate-spain-unemployment-eurozone |archivedate=3 May 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wiseman|first=Paul|title=As Europe struggles, young job-seekers suffer the most|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/world/story/2012-07-09/Youth-unemployment-rates-surge-in-Europe/56111752/1|newspaper=USA Today|date=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high unemployment rate, at 56% as of June 2013, is overstated. Subtracting students and young mothers not looking for jobs, the actual number is closer to 22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21578702-spain-needs-its-young-people-create-new-businesses-great-migration | title =A great migration: Spain needs its young people to create new businesses|date=1 June 2013 |  work =The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From immigration to emigration ===

{{Further|Immigration to Spain}}
Large-scale immigration continued throughout 2008 despite severe unemployment, but by 2011 the [[OECD]] confirmed that the total number of people leaving the country (Spaniards and non-Spaniards) had over taken the number of arrivals. Spain is now a net emigrant country.&lt;ref name=Chaos2009&gt;{{Citation

==== Tourism====
As the financial crisis was getting started in Spain, it was already underway in the United States and other western countries. The decrease in [[disposable income]] of consumers led to a sharp decrease in [[Tourism in Spain|Spain's tourist industry]], a rarity in a country with so many coastal towns. Indeed, the EU as a group saw a decline in tourists coming to their countries in 2008 and 2009, with −13% tourism growth in coastal Spain. Despite its traditional popularity with Korean and Japanese tourists, the relatively expensive cost of holidaying in Spain led many to pursue "sun and beach" Mediterranean getaways in Turkey, Spain's tourism rival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news-spain.euroresidentes.com/2009/05/impact-of-crisis-on-tourism-in-spains.html "Impact of Crisis on Tourism in Spain"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430092607/http://news-spain.euroresidentes.com/2009/05/impact-of-crisis-on-tourism-in-spains.html |date=30 April 2014 }}, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Spain has also seen the largest growth in tourism since 2011 and 2012. Its geographic advantages, the [[Arab Spring]], and other non-economic factors are contributing to its resurgence as a tourist destination. While Spain's economy itself is not doing well, [[purchasing power parity]] is generally rising again. Furthermore, violent unrest in North Africa and the Middle East is redirecting tourists towards stable countries like Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/despite-economy-spanish-tourism-prospers/|title=Despite economy, Spanish tourism prospers|first=Jennifer|last=Riggins|website=ZDNet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public debt  ==
[[File:Spanish debt and EU average.png|thumb|right|Spanish debt as % of GDP vs. Eurozone average, by year]]
Spain entered crisis period with a relatively modest public debt of 36.2% of GDP. This was largely due to ballooning tax revenue from the housing bubble, which helped accommodate a decade of increased government spending without debt accumulation.&lt;ref name=cato20120531 /&gt;&lt;ref name=economist20120616&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21556953 |title=The Spanish bail-out: Going to extra time|date=16 June 2012| work =The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the crisis, Spain initiated an austerity program consisting primarily of tax increases.&lt;ref name=cato20120531/&gt; [[Spanish Prime Minister|Prime Minister]] [[Mariano Rajoy]] announced on 11 July 2012 €65 billion of austerity, including cuts in wages and benefits and a VAT increase from 18% to 21%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303919504577520213420179248|title =Madrid Austerity Plan Boosted to $80 Billion |date=11 July 2012|author=David Roman and Nicholas Winning| work =Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government eventually succeeded to reduce its budget deficit from 11.2% of GDP in 2009 to 8.5% in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/27/debt-crisis-euro-german-votes-greek-package#block-50 |location=London |work= The Guardian | title=Eurozone crisis live: German parliament approves Greek package | date=27 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is expected to fall further to 5.4% in 2012.&lt;ref name=wsj20120611&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303768104577458562351966868 | title = Latest Europe Rescue Aims to Prop Up Spain |date=11 June 2012 |author=Charles Forell and Gabriele Steinhauser| work =Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ratings==
For the third time in 13 months, [[Moody's|Moody's Investors Service]] has cut Spain's rating. On 18 October 2011 Moody's Rating cut Spain's rating by 2 notches to A1 from Aa2 with the outlook remaining negative.

==2012 financial bailout==
[[File:RodeaElCongreso25S2012 02.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstration in Madrid, 25 September 2012]]
On 9 June 2012 the [[Eurogroup]] held an emergency meeting to discuss how to inject capital into Spanish banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1505824/0/rescate-espana/bancos/eurozona/|title=El Gobierno español pide el rescate bancario a Europa|date=9 June 2012|website=www.20minutos.es - Últimas Noticias}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMF estimated the capital needs of the Spanish banks to be about 40 billion euros. The Eurogroup announced intentions to provide up to 100 billion euro to the [[Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring]] to the Spanish government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diariodeavisos.com/2012/06/comunicado-integro-del-eurogrupo-sobre-el-rescate-a-la-banca-espanola/|title=Comunicado íntegro del Eurogrupo sobre el rescate a la banca española|first=Juan Jesús|last=Gutiérrez|date=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish government is then expected to give the appropriate amount of money to the respective banks. On 21 June 2012 it was decided that 62 billion euros would be shared among the Spanish banks in need. The European Union warned that rescued banks are subject to control and Union experts would meet stringent requirements.
Since then, the country's borrowing costs have reached levels deemed unsustainable in the long run, raising the prospect of a second aid program for Madrid following the 100 billion euro lifeline it obtained for its banks in June.&lt;ref name="cnbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/49412487 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102093034/http://www.cnbc.com/id/49412487 |archivedate=2 November 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain expects the European Commission, to approve the restructuring plans of the banks needing aid on 15 November 2012 and then to authorize the disbursal of the first credit line of up to 100 billion euros within three weeks after that.&lt;ref name="cnbc.com"/&gt;

A larger economy than other countries which have received bailout packages, Spain had considerable bargaining power regarding the terms of a bailout.&lt;ref name=NYTBP&gt;{{cite news|title=Spain Holds a Trump Card in Bank Bailout Negotiations|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/07/world/europe/spain-holds-a-trump-card-in-bank-bailout-talks.html|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 June 2012|author=Nicholas Kulish|author2=Raphael Minder}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to reforms already instituted by Spain's conservative government less stringent austerity requirements are included then was the case with earlier bailout packages for Ireland, Portugal, and Greece.&lt;ref name=FT66&gt;{{cite news|title=Europe weighs up limited Spanish rescue|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/81e1c8ec-afe5-11e1-ad0b-00144feabdc0.html|accessdate=6 June 2012|newspaper=The Financial Times|date=6 June 2012|author=Peter Spiegel|author2=Victor Mallet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT66&gt;{{cite news|title=Europe Is Ready With Aid for Spanish Banks, France Says|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/07/business/global/daily-euro-zone-watch.html|accessdate=6 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 June 2012|author=David Jolly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the EU's fifth largest economy, Spain remains a large concern. In 2011 Mariano Rajoy took over the government with his conservative views, pushing out [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] and his left-wing views.  Trying to get Spain out of the highest unemployment rate in the European Union was proven to be harder than expected. The bailout for Spain has been estimated to not be enough to restore the economy.  There is a serious debt in the country, and substantial cuts would have to be put in place to restore the economy at this point. Many youths are trying to find jobs abroad, creating a problem for the future domestic economy and job market.  Rajoy recently proposed a new budget for 2013 that would be very different and would cut government spending by 8.9%. By April 2013, unemployment had risen to 27%, but is now around 15% – 16.1% as of February 2018 and is one of Europe's fastest growing economies, thus demonstrating that the country is improving.

==Separatist movements==
One effect of the financial crisis is an increase in support for [[Catalan independence|independence]] in [[Catalonia]]. The Statute of Autonomy included a package of laws that gave more power to the region and would have recognized Catalonia as a nation, although one still within Spain. As with the rest of Spain, Catalonia has had high levels of unemployment. As many as 22% of the economically active population, which is still lower than Spain's national jobless rate, yet higher than Madrid. In 2010, [[Constitutional Court of Spain|Spain's Constitutional Court]] weakened the [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia|Statute of Autonomy for Catalonia]], which further irritated Catalan secessionist organization.

The [[2015 Catalan regional election|2015 regional election]] was the first to produce a majority for openly separatist parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2012/11/25/world/europe/spain-catalonia-elections/index.html|title=Ruling party in Catalonia region loses seats in parliament|first=Al |last=Goodman|website=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy insisted that [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Spain's constitution]] does not allow a region to secede. Spain's [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] unsuccessfully tried to get such a move approved in Parliament in 2008. Catalan president [[Artur Mas]] instead scheduled an [[2014 Catalan self-determination referendum|independence referendum for 2014]], which was downgraded to being a more informal ballot after further intervention by the Constitutional Court. The dispute remains unresolved, as of March 2015.
