"'''Tunnel Vision'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Justin Timberlake]] for his third [[studio album]], ''[[The 20/20 Experience]]'' (2013). It was written and produced by Timberlake, [[Timbaland|Timothy "Timbaland" Mosley]] and [[J-Roc (record producer)|Jerome "J-Roc" Harmon]], with additional writing by [[James Fauntleroy]]. "Tunnel Vision" was digitally released on June 14, 2013 by [[RCA Records]] as the third single from the album. It is a mid-tempo [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] song with [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] influence and instrumentation featuring Timbaland's signature [[ad-libs]], record-[[scratching]], heavy [[drum]]s, melodic [[Bass (music)|bass]], [[orchestration]] and [[synthesizer]]. Its lyrics proclaim Timberlake's [[tunnel vision]] for his love interest, with several [[Voyeurism|voyeuristic]] references.

"Tunnel Vision" received generally positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], most of whom praised Timbaland's production, and it was cited as ''The 20/20 Experience''{{'}}s highlight. After the album's release, the song charted in South Korea and the United States because of high digital sales. It debuted on the [[Gaon Chart|singles chart]] in South Korea at number 27, selling 6,670 digital copies in its first week. "Tunnel Vision" peaked at number 40 on the US [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs|''Billboard'' Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart, and number eight on the UK [[UK R&amp;B Chart|R&amp;B Singles Chart]].

The [[music video]] for "Tunnel Vision" was directed by [[Jonathan Craven]], Simon McLoughlin and Jeff Nicholas, and premiered on July 3 on Timberlake's [[Vevo]] channel. In the seven-minute video, Timberlake and Timbaland watch nude women and dance. Critics labeled the video [[Not suitable for work|NSFW]] and compared it to the video for [[Robin Thicke]]'s 2013 single, "[[Blurred Lines]]". Originally banned on [[YouTube]], it was later posted with the condition that viewers disclose their age. The song was part of the [[set list]] for Timberlake's 2013 [[Legends of the Summer]] concert tour with rapper [[Jay-Z]] and his fifth solo tour, the 2013–15 [[The 20/20 Experience World Tour|20/20 Experience World Tour]].

== Critical reception ==
[[Consequence of Sound]]'s Sarah H.

In a less-enthusiastic review, Brad Stern of MTV Buzzworthy dismissed "Tunnel Vision" as "the album's most tediously grating moment".&lt;ref name="Buzzworhty"/&gt; Allan Raible of ABC News  praised the track's beat, but thought it would fit better on a song with fewer "tired 'loverman' clichés."&lt;ref name="ABC NEWS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2013/03/review-justin-timberlakes-the-2020-experience/|title=Review: Justin Timberlake's 'The 20/20 Experience'|publisher=[[ABC News]]|last=Rabile|first=Allan|date=March 23, 2013|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fact'' magazine's Lauren Martin described "Tunnel Vision" and "Don't Hold the Wall" as "two rousing, if mildly deja vu inducing, efforts."&lt;ref name="FACTMAG"/&gt; Jed Gottlieb of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' said that the song's "electro bump" would have been innovative if it had been released a year earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gottlieb |first=Jed |url=http://bostonherald.com/entertainment/music/album_reviews/2013/03/justin_timberlake_robs_from_the_past_for_his_new_release |title=Justin Timberlake robs from the past for his new release |work=[[Boston Herald]]|date=March 17, 2013 |accessdate=March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tunnel Vision"'s [[music video]] premiered on July 3, 2013 on Timberlake's [[Vevo]]  [[YouTube]] channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07FYdnEawAQ|title=Justin Timberlake&amp;nbsp;– Tunnel Vision (Explicit)|publisher=[[Vevo]]. [[YouTube]]|accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The singer [[Twitter|tweeted]], "Check out the new video for Tunnel Vision and be ready...it's explicit. -teamJT".&lt;ref name="video ban"/&gt; The video was directed by [[Jonathan Craven]], Simon McLoughlin and Jeff Nicholas, with a cameo appearance by Timbaland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/51410-watch-justin-timberlakes-tunnel-vision-video-features-lots-of-female-nudity-timbaland/|title=Watch: Justin Timberlake's "Tunnel Vision" Video Features Lots of Female Nudity, Timbaland|publisher=Pitchfork Media|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=July 3, 2013|accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craven and Nathan Scherrer produced the video for the Uprising Creative. Its director of photography was Sing Howe Yam, and Jacquelyn London edited the video for Sunset Edit.&lt;ref name="static"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videostatic.com/watch-it/2013/07/03/justin-timberlake-goes-nsfw-new-video-tunnel-vision|title=Justin Timberlake Goes NSFW with New Video 'Tunnel Vision'|publisher=Video Static|last=Gottlieb|first=Steven|date=July 3, 2013|accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven-minute video features Timberlake and Timbaland gazing at three nude women; according to Jason Lipshutz of ''Billboard'', the women are wearing flesh-colored [[G-string]]s. In some shots, Timberlake's face is projected onto the women's bodies.&lt;ref name="billboard mv review"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/1568870/justin-timberlake-admires-naked-women-in-nsfw-tunnel-vision-video|title=Justin Timberlake Admires Naked Women in NSFW 'Tunnel Vision' Video: Watch|work=Billboard|last=Lipshutz|first=Jason|date=July 3, 2013|accessdate=July 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan Sargent of ''Spin'' called the set pieces where projections of Timberlake interact with the nude dancers "a fractured dynamic that mirrors 'Tunnel Vision' itself".&lt;ref name="spin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://spin.com/articles/justin-timberlake-tunnel-vision-video/|title=Watch Justin Timberlake Put His Face on Naked Women in 'Tunnel Vision' Video|work=Spin|last=Sargent|first=Jordan|date=July 3, 2013|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cinya Burton of [[E!]] wrote about Timberlake's video wardrobe, "Apparently when Justin Timberlake isn't in his now-signature suit and tie getup, he's donning [[AllSaints]]." The singer wore two head-to-toe ensembles by the brand. The first was a gray Baxley V-neck T-shirt layered under a white Redono half-sleeved shirt, with casual Charge Chino pants. The second, a darker combination worn while he dances against a lighter background, was a black Resident Crew T-shirt, dark gray Pipe Chino pants, a Duncan denim shirt and black Trap boots. According to Burton, "While his ensembles are both dapper", the nude models in the video attracted more attention.&lt;ref name="wardrobe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.eonline.com/news/437065/gimme-that-justin-timberlake-s-allsaints-looks-in-tunnel-vision-video|title=Gimme That!

=== Critical response and ban ===
[[File:Robin Thicke 2014.jpg|upright|thumbnail|right|alt=A Caucasian man wearing glasses is smilling|Critics have compared the "Tunnel Vision" video to the one for [[Robin Thicke]]'s "[[Blurred Lines]]".]]

Critics have called the video [[Not suitable for work|NSFW]], comparing it to the 2013 video for "[[Blurred Lines]]" by [[Robin Thicke]] with [[Pharrell Williams]] and [[T.I.]].&lt;ref name="static"/&gt;&lt;ref name="billboard mv review"/&gt; In an interview with [[Capital (radio network)|Capital FM]], Thicke responded to a question about the videos' similarity: "No comment. I'll let you do all the talking. It's a subject that has no good ending."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://capitalfm.com/artists/robin-thicke/news/justin-timberlake-tunnel-vision-blurred-lines/|title=Robin Thicke Says "No Comment" On 'Tunnel Vision' And 'Blurred Lines' Comparisons|publisher=[[Capital (radio network)|Capital FM]]|date=July 10, 2013|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fact'' magazine called the video's concept simple, and said its production team was unconcerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factmag.com/2013/07/03/watch-justin-timberlakes-nsfw-video-for-tunnel-vision/|title=Watch Justin Timberlake's NSFW video for 'Tunnel Vision'|work=Fact|date=July 3, 2013|accessdate=July 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Spin''{{'}}s Jordan Sargent, "Like his new album ''The 20/20 Experience'', in which half the songs run longer than seven minutes, the 'Tunnel Vision' video is self-consciously artistic and mature. But the video is also at times effective, particularly when the editing gets choppier during the bridge."&lt;ref name="spin"/&gt;

About the nude women in the video, an [[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV UK]] reviewer said that Timberlake drew on Thicke's video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mtv.co.uk/news/justin-timberlake/385430-justin-timberlake-naked-ladies-new-video-tunnel-vision|title=Justin Timberlake Recruits Nude Women For NSFW Video|publisher=[[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV UK]]|date=July 4, 2013|accessdate=July 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Huffington Post''{{'}}s Sarah Dean wrote that Timberlake used a tip from Thicke to accompany a "great" song with a video objectifying women who enjoy dancing nude, criticizing the use of three women for a song with lyrics about a single love interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/07/04/justin-timberlake-tunnel-vision-video-naked-women_n_3545159.html|title=Justin Timberlake Banned 'Tunnel Vision' Video Features Multiple Naked Women (NSFW Video)|publisher=The Huffington Post|last=Dean|first=Sarah|date=July 4, 2013|accessdate=July 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tamar Anitai of MTV Buzzworthy, Timberlake wanted to live his life and celebrate his album's success: "Oh, come on! Don't complain. You bitched and moaned endlessly when Justin Timberlake stopped making music for six years, so don't get all Veruca Salty when he comes back with boobs to spare and boobs to share."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2013/07/03/justin-timberlakes-topless-tunnel-vision-video-gif-reactions/|title=Justin Timberlake's Topless 'Tunnel Vision' Video: GIF Reactions|publisher=MTV Buzzworthy|last=Anitai|first=Tamar|date=July 3, 2013|accessdate=July 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her review, Rachel Maresca of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' wrote that Timberlake slurred some of the song's explicit lyrics in the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/justin-timberlake-releases-nude-music-video-tunnel-vision-article-1.1390188|title=Justin Timberlake's nude 'Tunnel Vision' music video banned from YouTube, causes fireworks on July 4|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|last=Maresca|first=Rachel|date=July 4, 2013|accessdate=July 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kathy McCabe of [[News Corp Australia]], Timberlake escalated the pop-porn movement with the video: "With mummy blogger outrage over Robin Thicke's exploitation of topless women for his Blurred Lines video&amp;nbsp;– and its questionable lyrics&amp;nbsp;– still raging, Timberlake has gone even further in his clip".&lt;ref name="aus review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.com.au/entertainment/music/justin-timberlake8217s-new-video-for-single-tunnel-vision-his-raunchiest-yet-and-robin-thicke8217s-new-song-give-it-2-u-more-explicit-than-blurred-lines/story-e6frfn09-1226674421602|title=Justin Timberlake's new video for single Tunnel Vision his raunchiest yet, and Robin Thicke's new song Give It 2 U more explicit than Blurred Lines|publisher=[[News Corp Australia]]|last=McCabe|first=Kathy|date=July 4, 2013|accessdate=July 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCabe wrote that male pop singers have been influenced by [[Rihanna]] and [[Katy Perry]], who have "stripped down in the name of a hit. Or art. Or freedom of expression, depending on the press release spin".&lt;ref name="aus review"/&gt; ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]''{{'}}s Robin Murray wrote that pop music has lacked raunchiness and sex appeal for some time, and Timberlake's return was needed: "Lavish, lush and 21st century in a direct, shocking fashion, the video finds Justin Timberlake on perfect preening form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://clashmusic.com/videos/justin-timberlake-tunnel-vision-explicit|title=Justin Timberlake&amp;nbsp;– Tunnel Vision (Explicit)|work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]|last=Murray|first=Rbon|date=July 4, 2013|accessdate=July 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the video's release it was banned from YouTube with a message saying, "This video has been removed as a violation of YouTube's policy on nudity or sexual content".&lt;ref name="video ban"/&gt; The website quickly restored the video with a content warning and the requirement that viewers sign in (to verify their age). Although a YouTube representative declined to comment on individual videos, he issued a statement: "While our guidelines generally prohibit nudity, we make exceptions when it is presented in an educational, documentary or artistic context, and take care to add appropriate warnings and age restrictions".&lt;ref name="video ban"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.eonline.com/news/436612/justin-timberlake-debuts-racy-tunnel-vision-music-video-amid-brief-youtube-ban|title=Justin Timberlake Debuts Racy "Tunnel Vision" Music Video Amid Brief YouTube Ban|publisher=E!|last=Grossberg|first=Josh|date=July 5, 2013|accessdate=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Live performances ==
Timberlake first performed "Tunnel Vision" at the [[Phoenix Park]] concert in [[Dublin, Ireland]], as part of a set list which included "[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]", "[[SexyBack]]" and "[[My Love (Justin Timberlake song)|My Love]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rte.ie/ten/news/2013/0711/461819-40-000-bring-sexy-back-with-justin-timberlake/|title=40,000 bring 'Sexy Back' with Justin Timberlake|publisher=[[RTÉ.ie]]|date=July 11, 2013|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of the concert, John Balfe of [[entertainment.ie]] wrote: "Even the album's more well-known songs like 'Tunnel Vision', 'Mirrors' and 'Suit &amp; Tie' don't yet have the same weight in the setlist as some of JT's more established hits and it was songs like 'SexyBack' that really got the 40,000 strong crowd to move".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.ie/music/news/Live-Review-Justin-Timberlake-Phoenix-Park-10th-July/200606.htm|title=Live Review: Justin Timberlake, Phoenix Park&amp;nbsp;– 10th July|publisher=[[entertainment.ie]]|last=Balfe|first=John|date=July 11, 2013|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 12 Timberlake appeared on the main stage at the [[Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park]] in [[Stratford, London]] as part of the [[Wireless Festival]], performing "Tunnel Vision" and other songs dressed in black and wearing a black [[fedora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nme.com/news/justin-timberlake/71419|title=Jay-Z joins Justin Timberlake onstage at London's Wireless Festival|work=[[NME]]|date=July 13, 2013|accessdate=July 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was on the [[set list]]s of Timberlake's 2013 [[Legends of the Summer Stadium Tour]] with rapper [[Jay-Z]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/review/justin-timberlake-jay-z-affirm-594902|title=Justin Timberlake, Jay Z Affirm Their 'Legends' Status with Rose Bowl Bow: Concert Review|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|last=Godley|first=Chris|date=July 29, 2013|accessdate=May 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his fifth worldwide tour, the 2013–15 [[The 20/20 Experience World Tour|20/20 Experience World Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wpgc.cbslocal.com/2014/02/24/justin-timberlake-2020-experience-world-tour-set-list/|title=Justin Timberlake's '20/20 Experience' World Tour Set List|publisher=[[CBS Local Media]]|date=February 24, 2014|accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
