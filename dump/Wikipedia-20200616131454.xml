[[File:Malone Attempt title page, cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edmond Malone]] was the first scholar to construct a tentative chronology of Shakespeare's plays in ''An Attempt to Ascertain the Order in Which the Plays attributed to Shakspeare were Written'' (1778), an essay published in the second edition of [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[George Steevens]]' ''[[The Plays of William Shakespeare]]''.]]
This article presents a possible '''''chronological listing of the composition of the [[Shakespeare's plays|plays]] of [[William Shakespeare]]'''''.

Shakespearean scholars, beginning with [[Edmond Malone]] in 1778, have attempted to reconstruct the relative chronology of Shakespeare's ''oeuvre'' by various means, using external evidence (such as references to the plays by Shakespeare's contemporaries in both critical material and private documents, allusions in other plays, entries in the [[Stationers' Register]], and records of performance and publication), and internal evidence (allusions within the plays to contemporary events, composition and publication dates of sources used by Shakespeare, stylistic analysis looking at the development of his style and diction over time, and the plays' context in the contemporary theatrical and literary ''[[milieu]]''). Most modern chronologies are based on the work of [[E. K. Chambers|E.K. Chambers]] in "The Problem of Chronology" (1930), published in his book ''William Shakespeare: A Study of Facts and Problems, Vol. I''.

== Introduction ==
Since the surviving evidence is fragmentary, there is not, neither can there be a definitive or precise chronology. Performance history is often of limited use, as the first recorded performance of many plays was not necessarily when that play was first performed. For example, the first recorded performance of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' was not until 1662, yet we know the play was performed in Shakespeare's lifetime.&lt;ref name="Levinson 70-71"&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Levenson| editor-first=Jill L. | title=Romeo and Juliet | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2000 | pages=70–71 | isbn=978-0-19-953589-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus,  performance history reveals little about the date of composition.

Similarly, dates of first publication are often relatively useless in determining a chronology, as roughly half the plays were not published until seven years after Shakespeare's death, in the ''[[First Folio]]'' (1623), prepared by [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]], and published by [[Edward Blount]], [[William Jaggard]] and Isaac Jaggard. Performance dates and publication dates are also problematic insofar as many of the plays were performed several years before they were published. For example, ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' was performed in 1592, but not published until 1594, ''[[Othello]]'' was performed in 1604 but not published until 1622, ''[[King Lear]]'' was performed in 1606 but not published until 1608. Performance and publication dates can thus be used only to determine terminal dates of composition, with the initial dates often remaining so much more speculative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Chambers | first=E.K. | authorlink=E. K. Chambers | title=William Shakespeare: A Study of Facts and Problems, Vol. I | location=Oxford | publisher=Clarendon | year=1930 | page=[https://archive.org/details/williamshakespea017475mbp/page/n284 245] | url=https://archive.org/details/williamshakespea017475mbp | isbn=978-0-19-811773-5 | accessdate=26 October 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909142016/https://archive.org/details/williamshakespea017475mbp | archivedate=9 September 2015 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some scholars dissent from the conventional dating system altogether. A notable scholar to do so is [[E. A. J. Honigmann]], who has attempted to push back the beginning of Shakespeare's career four or five years to the mid-1580s, with his "early start" theory. Honigmann argues that Shakespeare began his career with ''Titus Andronicus'' in 1586 (the conventional school of thought is that Shakespeare began writing plays upon arriving in London ''c.''1590).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Honigmann | first=E.A.J. | authorlink=E.

=== Modern ''Complete Works'' ===
There are six major modern scholarly editions of the ''[[Complete Works of Shakespeare]]'':
* ''The [[Riverside Shakespeare]]'' (edited by [[G. Blakemore Evans]] in 1974, with a second edition in 1996)
* ''[[The Oxford Shakespeare]]: The Complete Works'' (edited by [[Stanley Wells]], [[Gary Taylor (scholar)|Gary Taylor]], [[John Jowett]] and [[William Montgomery (English literature scholar)|William Montgomery]] in 1986, with a second edition in 2005)
* ''The [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company|Norton]] Shakespeare: Based on the Oxford Edition'' (edited by [[Stephen Greenblatt]], [[Walter Cohen]], [[Jean E. Howard]] and [[Katharine Eisaman Maus]] in 1997, with a second edition in 2008)
* ''[[Arden Shakespeare|The Arden Shakespeare: Complete Works]]'' (edited by [[Richard Proudfoot]], [[Ann Thompson (scholar)|Ann Thompson]] and [[David Scott Kastan]] in 1998, with a second edition in 2002 and a third in 2011)
* ''The Complete [[Pelican Books|Pelican]] Shakespeare'' (edited by [[Stephen Orgel]] and [[A. R. Braunmuller]] in 2002), and
* ''[[Royal Shakespeare Company|The RSC Shakespeare: Complete Works]]'' (edited by [[Jonathan Bate]] and [[Eric Rasmussen (scholar)|Eric Rasmussen]] in 2007).

Additionally, as with Oxford, Arden, Pelican and the RSC, the [[New Cambridge Shakespeare]], the New [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] Shakespeare, the [[New American Library|Signet]] Classic Shakespeare, the [[J. Dover Wilson|Dover Wilson]] Shakespeare, the Shakespeare Folios and the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] all publish scholarly editions of individual plays, although none have issued a complete works volume.

''Arden'' presents the plays alphabetically without any attempt to construct an overall chronology. ''Oxford'', ''Riverside'', ''Norton'' and ''RSC'' all present chronologies which differ from one another and which attempt to construct only approximate dating. The following list is based on that of ''The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works''  (2nd ed.) and the accompanying ''William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion'' (Revised ed.), edited by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor. However, none of the major chronologies has any real authority over any of the others.

=== ''[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'' (1589–1591) ===

:'''''First published''''': ''First Folio'' (1623).

:'''''Evidence''''': Stanley Wells argues that the play's "dramatic structure is comparatively unambitious, and while some of its scenes are expertly constructed, those involving more than, at the most, four characters betray an uncertainty of technique suggestive of inexperience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Wells | editor1-first=Stanley | editor1-link=Stanley Wells | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Gary | editor2-link=Gary Taylor (scholar) | editor3-last=Jowett | editor3-first=John | editor3-link=John Jowett | editor4-last=Montgomery | editor4-first=William | title=The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2005 | edition=2nd | origyear=1986 | page=[https://archive.org/details/completeworks0000shak_f0m2/page/1 1] | isbn=978-0-19-926718-7 | url=https://archive.org/details/completeworks0000shak_f0m2/page/1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The play is therefore considered one of the first Shakespeare composed after his arrival in London ''c.''1590, at which point he would have lacked theatrical experience. Furthermore, the discussion between Launce and Speed regarding the vices and virtues of Launce's mistress (3.1.276-359&lt;ref&gt;For each play, line references, and occasionally even scene numbers and divisions, can differ substantially from edition to edition. In order to maintain a degree of continuity, all line references throughout this article are to the individual Oxford Shakespeare editions, unless otherwise noted.&lt;/ref&gt;) seems to borrow from [[John Lyly]]'s ''[[Midas (Lyly play)|Midas]]'', which was written in late 1588 and/or early 1589, thus fixing a ''[[terminus post quem]]'' for the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Warren | editor-first=Roger | title=The Two Gentlemen of Verona | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2008 | pages=20, 25–27 | isbn=978-0-19-283142-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situates the date of composition as somewhere between 1589 and 1591, by which time it is known Shakespeare was working on the ''Henry VI'' plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Leech | editor-first=Clifford | editor-link=Clifford Leech | title=The Two Gentlemen of Verona | location=London | publisher=Methuen | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Second Series | year=1969 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/twogentlemenofve00shak_3/page/ xxx–xxxiv] | isbn=978-0-17-443581-5 | url=https://archive.org/details/twogentlemenofve00shak_3/page/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Carroll | editor-first=William C. | title=The Two Gentlemen of Verona | location=London | publisher=Thompson Learning | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2004 | pages=116–130 | isbn=978-1-903436-95-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2008 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, Roger Warren, following E.A.J.

=== ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' (1590–1591) ===
[[File:A Shrew TP 1596.jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|1596 second quarto of ''A Shrew'']]
:'''''First official record''''': possible version of the play entered into [[Stationers' Register]] by [[Peter Short (printer)|Peter Short]] on 2 May 1594 as "a booke intituled A plesant Conceyted historie called the Tayminge of a Shrowe." First record of the play as it exists today is found in the ''First Folio'' (1623).
:'''''First published''''': possible version of the play published in [[quarto]] in 1594 as ''A Pleasant Conceited Historie, called The taming of a Shrew'' (printed by Peter Short for [[Cuthbert Burby]]). This text was republished in 1596 (again by Short for Burby) and 1607 (by [[Valentine Simmes]] for [[Nicholas Ling]]). The play as it exists today was first published in the ''First Folio'' as ''The Taming of the Shrew''.
:'''''Additional information (publication)''''': there is a general lack of scholarly agreement regarding the exact relationship between the 1594 ''A Shrew'' and the 1623 ''The Shrew''. Originally, ''A Shrew'' was seen as a non-Shakespearean source for ''The Shrew'', meaning ''The Shrew'' must have been completed sometime after 2 May 1594.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Chambers | first=E.K. | authorlink=E.

This text was republished in 1600 (by Valentine Simmes for Millington) and in 1619.

Most critics take Nashe's reference to Talbot as supportive of the fact that the play Henslowe saw was ''1 Henry VI''. If, then, it was a new play in March 1592, and if we also assume that it was a prequel written after the other two plays in the trilogy, the play was most likely written in 1591 or very early 1592.&lt;ref name="Taylor 1-10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor 1H6" /&gt;

Regarding specific performances however, there is little solid evidence. In 1602, [[John Manningham]] mentions seeing [[Richard Burbage]] playing the role of Richard, probably at the [[Globe Theatre|Globe]], where his performance so impressed a female member of the audience that she asked him to visit her later that night in the guise of [[Richard III of England|Richard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Dover Wilson | editor-first=John | editor-link=J.

:'''''Evidence''''': it is known that ''Richard III'' was definitely a sequel to ''True Tragedy'', which was on stage by 23 June 1592, hence ''Richard III'' must have been written roughly around the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Lull | editor-first=Janice | title=King Richard III | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2009 | origyear=1999 | edition=Revised | pages=4–5 | isbn=978-0-521-73556-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common argument regarding Shakespeare's chronology at this point in his career is that ''Richard III'' is a significantly better play than any of the ''Henry VI'' plays, with a much tighter structure, a more mature manner and a greater degree of stylistic control. This dramatic improvement in his writing is attributed to his absorbing the lessons of [[Senecan tragedy]] when composing ''Titus'', which he was then able to incorporate into ''Richard''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mincoff | first=Marco | authorlink=Marco Mincoff | title=Shakespeare: The First Steps | location=Sofia | publisher=Bulgarian Academy of Sciences | year=1976 | pages=110–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in his 2000 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare, John Jowett argues that the play may originally have been written for [[Lord Strange's Men]], but Shakespeare added some new material after it had passed to [[Pembroke's Men]], a company which formed in mid-1592 and disbanded in September 1593. The patron of Strange's Men was [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby]], a direct descent of [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby]], a major character in the play. However Shakespeare altered much of his source material (Sir [[Thomas More]]'s ''History of King Richard III'') regarding this character, presenting him as far more heroic and honourable than does More. For example, Shakespeare has Thomas lead a battalion against Richard at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]], when it was in fact his brother [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|William]] who led them. This suggests Shakespeare was writing with Ferdinando in mind, knowingly praising the ancestor of the company's patron. However, the play also takes the time to praise the ancestors of the patron of Pembroke's Men, [[Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]]. Prior to the Battle of Bosworth, a list of names of lords who have joined [[Henry VII of England|Richmond]]'s cause is read aloud, two of whom are "Sir Walter Herbert, a renown'd soldier" (4.5.9) and "redoubted [[William Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]]" (4.5.11). This passage is completely extraneous to the rest of the plot, is almost always cut in performance and has been argued to be an addition to the original composition. Pembroke is later mentioned by Richmond, who asks for him to be sent to his tent to consult on the eve of battle (5.4.5-8), a request never mentioned again. Additionally, in Q1, Richmond is flanked by "three lords" in 5.2, but in F1, the lords are all named, one of whom is the previously mentioned Walter Herbert. Both the request for Pembroke, which is subsequently forgotten, and the change of the anonymous lord to a specific historical individual suggest addition after initial composition. Jowett argues that coupled with the narratively vital praise of Stanley's ancestor, the less integrated references to Herbert and Pembroke create something of a hypothetical internal chronology of composition in which Shakespeare initially writes the play for Strange's Men, but, perhaps due to the closing of the theatres in June 1592, the play passes to Pembroke's Men for a regional tour, at which point he adds the lines praising the ancestors of the new company in whose hands the play has now found itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Jowett | editor-first=John | editor-link=John Jowett | title=The Tragedy of King Richard III | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2000 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/tragedyofkingric0000shak_p5i3/page/5 5–7] | isbn=978-0-19-953588-0 | url=https://archive.org/details/tragedyofkingric0000shak_p5i3/page/5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giorgio Melchiori believes the connection to Pembroke's Men can help date the play. All of the Shakespearean plays performed by Pembroke's Men are pre-plague; ''Taming of the Shrew'', ''The Contention'', ''True Tragedy'', ''Titus'' and ''Richard III''. These plays all feature relatively large casts, with an emphasis on platforms, at least two doors and an upper stage. ''Edward III'', however, needs only ten adult actors and one boy (the most cast intensive scene is 5.1). Battle scenes are also muted, especially when compared to ''True Tragedy'' or ''Richard III'', and the siege scene (4.2) requires no doors or upper stage. The conclusion reached by Melchiori regarding this evidence is that the writer(s) of the play were unsure where it was going to be staged, and therefore wrote it in such a way that it could be adequately staged by a small company performing on a basic stage. This would suggest it was written during the closure of the theatres, which places the date of composition sometime between mid-1592 and late 1593.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Slater | first=Eliot | title=The Problem of The Reign of King Edward III: A Statistical Approach | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1988 | pages=80–101 | isbn=978-0-521-12348-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Melchiori | editor-first=Giorgio | editor-link=Giorgio Melchiori | title=King Edward III | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=1998 | pages=6–9 | isbn=978-0-521-59673-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These four plays are argued to represent a phase of Shakespeare's career when he was experimenting with rhyming [[iambic pentameter]] as an alternative form to standard blank verse; ''Richard II'' has more rhymed verse than any other history play (19.1%), ''Romeo and Juliet'' more than any other tragedy (16.6%) and ''Love's Labour's'' and ''Midsummer Night'' more than any other comedy (43.1% and 45.5% respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Harbage | editor-first=Alfred | editor-link=Alfred Harbage | title=Love's Labour's Lost | location=London | publisher=Penguin | year=1973 | edition=Revised | series=The Pelican Shakespeare | origyear=1963 | page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; All four tend to be dated to the period 1594–1595.&lt;ref name="Woudhuysen 60"&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Woudhuysen | editor-first=H.R. | title=Love's Labour's Lost | location=London | publisher=Thomas Nelson | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=1998 | page=60 | isbn=978-1-904271-10-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of this, [[Ants Oras]]' pause test places the play after ''Richard III'', which is usually dated 1592. Furthermore, Gary Taylor finds possible allusions to the Gray's Inn revels of December 1594 (specifically the Muscovite [[masque]] in 5.2), and also finds plausible Geoffrey Bullough's argument that the satirical presentation of the King of Navarre (loosely based on [[Henry IV of France|Henry of Navarre]], who was associated with oath breaking after abjuring [[Protestantism]] in 1593) favours a date after December 1594, when Henry survived an assassination attempt by [[Jean Châtel]].

=== ''[[Love's Labour's Won]]'' (1595–1596) ===
[[File:LLW on Hunt's play list.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christopher Hunt]]'s list of plays; the bottom entry reads "Loves labor won."]]
:'''''First official record''''': Francis Meres' ''Palladis Tamia'' (1598), referred to as "''Love labours wonne''."
:'''''First published''''': prior to 1603; format and exact date unknown.
:'''''First recorded performance''''': there are no recorded performances of the play, but the fact that it is mentioned in ''Palladis Tamia'' strongly suggests it was performed.
:'''''Additional information (existence)''''': there are only two known references to this play. One is in Meres' ''Palladis Tamia'', the other is a fragment of [[Christopher Hunt]]'s inventory, listing sixteen "ludes and tragedyes" sold from 9 to 17 August 1603. The list includes four Shakespearean plays; ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', ''The Taming of a Shrew'', ''Love's Labour's Lost'', and ''Love's Labour's Won''. Up until 1953, only Meres' reference was known, until Hunt's two pages of handwriting were discovered in the backing of a copy of [[Thomas Gataker]]'s ''Certaine Sermones''. The discovery was handed over to T.W. Baldwin, who published his findings in 1957 in ''Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Won''. Baldwin argues that the title of the play suggests it was a sequel to ''Love's Labour's Lost'', which is partially supported by the unusually open-ended nature of that play (the main characters all vow to meet again in a year's time). However, whether the play ever existed has been debated, with some critics speculating that it is simply another name for one of Shakespeare's known plays, a situation similar to ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'', which was originally performed with the title ''All is True''. As Meres refers to ''The Two Gentlemen of Verona'', ''The Comedy of Errors'' and ''The Merchant of Venice'', prior to the discovery of the Hunt reference, a common suggestion was ''The Taming of the Shrew'', but as Hunt mentions this play, it could not be ''Love's Labour's Won''. ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', ''[[As You Like It]]'', ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' and ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' have also been cited as possibilities, with ''All's Well'' the most favoured. However, these plays all tend to be dated later than 1598 (although the argument is that ''Love's Labour's Won'' is an early draft). As there are no other pre-1598 Shakespearean comedies with which to equate it, it seems certain that the play did exist, that it was performed and published, but that it has since been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Hibbard | editor-first=G.R. | title=Love's Labour's Lost | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1990 | pages=81–83 | isbn=978-0-19-953681-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This text was republished twice in 1598 (on both occasions by Simmes for Wise), 1608 (by William Wright for Matthew Lawe) and 1615 (again by Wright for Lawe). The ''Folio'' text appears under the title ''The life and death of King Richard the Second''.
:'''''First recorded performance''''': possible performance on 9 December 1595 at Sir [[Edward Hoby]]'s house. On that date, Hoby's wife, Margaret Carey, daughter of [[Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon]] (chief patron of the Lord Chamberlain's Men), wrote a letter to Robert Cecil inviting him to supper and to see "K. Richard present him self to your vewe&lt;!--not a typo--&gt;." This could be a reference to a private performance of ''Richard II'', especially because of the Hunsdon connection with Shakespeare's company. However, some scholars argue that "K. Richard" could be a painting, not a play, whilst others argue there is no evidence that even if it is a play, it necessarily refers to ''Richard II'', suggesting it could refer to ''Richard III'' or to another play entirely.

:'''''Evidence''''': ''Richard II'' is usually seen as one of the 'lyrical plays', along with ''Love's Labour's Lost'', ''Romeo and Juliet'' and ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''; four plays in which Shakespeare used rhymed iambic pentameter more than anywhere else in his career. The four plays also include elaborate [[pun]]ning, [[rhetoric]]al patterning, a general avoidance of colloquialisms and a high volume of [[Metre (poetry)|metrical]] regularity. All four of these plays tend to be dated to 1594–1595.&lt;ref name="Woudhuysen 60" /&gt; Also important in dating the play is [[Samuel Daniel]]'s ''The First Four Books of the Civil Wars'', which was entered into the Stationers' Register on 11 October 1594, and published in early 1595. Although some scholars have suggested that Daniel used Shakespeare as a source, which would mean the play was written somewhat earlier than 1594, most agree that Shakespeare used Daniel, especially in some of the later scenes, meaning the play could not have been written earlier than 1595.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Forker | editor-first=Charles R. | title=King Richard II | location=London | publisher=Thompson Learning | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2002 | pages=111–116 | isbn=978-1-903436-33-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Gurr | editor-first=Andrew | editor-link=Andrew Gurr | title=King Richard II | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2003 | edition=Revised | origyear=1984 | pages=1–4 | isbn=978-0-521-53248-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''''Evidence''''': as there is virtually no external evidence (other than the quarto text which establishes 1597 as a ''terminus ante quem'') with which to date the play, most arguments tend to centre on references within the play to topical events, publication dates of Shakespeare's influences, and stylistic evidence. A much discussed possible topical allusion is the [[Nurse (Romeo and Juliet)|Nurse]]'s reference to an earthquake which took place eleven years previously (1.3.24-36). The specificity of this reference has led many scholars to argue that Shakespeare must have been referring to a real earthquake. Originally, [[Thomas Tyrwhitt]] suggested the [[1580 Dover Straits earthquake]], which would place the composition of the play in 1591.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Evans | editor-first=G.

:'''''Evidence''''': stylistically, ''Midsummer Night'' is very much part of the 'lyrical plays', which would suggest a date of composition in 1594 or 1595.&lt;ref name="Woudhuysen 60" /&gt; A strong argument that it was written immediately after ''Romeo and Juliet'' is the nature of ''[[Pyramus and Thisbe]]'', which features a pair of ill-fated lovers who arrange to meet in secret and which ends with the heroine killing herself over the body of her dead love. In his 1979 edition of the play for the second series of the Arden Shakespeare, Harold F.

That the second is the more likely of the two is due to the fact that Elizabeth's grandfather was Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon and her father was [[George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon]], successive patrons of the Lord Chamberlain's Men.

:'''''Evidence''''': the play was obviously in existence by 1598. However, other evidence places its date of composition as probably 1596 or very early 1597. An important topical allusion is Salarino's reference to "my wealthy ''Andrew'' docked in sand" (1.1.28). This is thought to refer to the ''San Andrés'', a Spanish [[galleon]] that ran aground in [[Cádiz]] in June 1596 after a surprise attack under the command of Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex. The ship was subsequently captured, renamed the ''St. Andrew'' and incorporated into the [[Royal Navy]]. However, she remained in the news throughout 1596. Upon arriving in England, she nearly ran aground on the [[Thames Estuary]]. In August, she served as a [[troopship]] during the [[Islands Voyage]], and upon returning to a stormy England in October, Essex refused to allow her to sail past the [[Goodwin Sands]], a location also referred to by Salarino (3.1.4-5).

William served as Lord Chamberlain from August 1596 to March 1597, and only in that period would he have had the authority to demand the alteration of a play which he found objectionable.

''1 Henry IV'' was definitely written by early 1597. ''Henry V'' was completed by September 1599. ''2 Henry IV'' was written at some point between these two. Exactly where ''Merry Wives'' fits into the sequence is unknown, but attempts to date the composition of the play by locating the plot within the overall ''Henriad'' have proved fruitless. The plot of ''Merry Wives'' does not fit into the plot of the ''Henriad'' in any chronological or logical sense; there are continuity problems no matter where in the sequence one locates the play. For example, Falstaff and [[Mistress Quickly]] don't know one another at the start of ''Merry Wives'', whereas in ''1 Henry IV'', they have known one another for over thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Craik | editor-first=T.W. | title=The Merry Wives of Windsor | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1990 | pages=11–12 | isbn=978-0-19-953682-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Jowett, editor of the play for the ''Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works'', argues it is not supposed to fit into the ''Henriad'' at all, it is "essentially an [[Shakespearean comedy|Elizabethan comedy]], the only one that Shakespeare set firmly in England.

Hotson believes the play was commissioned for the Feast by George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon, who had recently succeeded his father as patron of Shakespeare's Lord Chamberlain's Men and was to be one of the newly elected knights.

:'''''First published''''': published in quarto in 1600 as ''The second part of Henrie the fourth, continuing to his death, and coronation of Henrie the fift. With the humours of Sir John Falstaffe, and swaggering Pistoll'' (printed by Valentine Simmes for Andrew Wise and William Aspley) The 1623 ''Folio'' text appears under the title ''The Second Part of Henry the Fourth, Containing his Death: and the Coronation of King Henry the Fift''.
:'''''First recorded performance''''': probable performance took place on or around 14 February 1613, when either ''1 Henry IV'' or ''2 Henry IV'' (or both) were performed at court as part of the celebrations for the marriage of Princess Elizabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine. A play performed under the title ''Sir Iohn Falstaffe'' is thought to refer to ''2 Henry IV''. It is unlikely to refer to ''1 Henry IV'' as a play under the name ''The Hotspur'' would seem to indicate that play. Additionally, a list of plays under consideration for court performance in 1620, compiled by [[George Buck]], [[Master of the Revels]], mentions the "Second part of Falstaffe not plaid theis&lt;!--not a typo--&gt; 7. yeres&lt;!--not a typo--&gt;." This would seem to confirm the 1613 performance as ''2 Henry IV'', as, due to the lack of republication of the initial 1600 quarto text, it is known that ''2 Henry IV'' was not nearly as popular as ''1 Henry IV'' (which was republished five times prior to 1623).&lt;ref name="Melchiori 38-39" /&gt;
:'''''Evidence''''': as a sequel to ''1 Henry IV'' and a prequel to ''Henry V'', the play was obviously written at some point between the two. We know that ''1 Henry IV'' was probably written by early 1597 at the latest, and that ''Henry V'' was written by September 1599, so ''2 Henry IV'' can be dated from early 1597 to September 1599. There is some tentative evidence to narrow the date further, however. For example, the fact that Falstaff seems to have been called Falstaff from the very inception of ''2 Henry IV'' would suggest the play was written after the censoring of ''1 Henry IV'' in 1596/1597.&lt;ref name="Richard James" /&gt; The fact that the 25 February 1598 Stationers' Register entry for ''1 Henry IV'' does not identity it as the first part of a two-part play has led some scholars to speculate that ''2 Henry IV'' could not have been completed by that date.&lt;ref name="Taylor 120" /&gt; There is also a reference to the character of Justice Shallow in [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Every Man out of His Humour]]'', which was first acted in 1599, indicating the play was well enough known by then for an audience to understand the allusion.

Other pieces of evidence also serve to link it to 1599. For example, the play's absence from ''Palladis Tamia'' suggests it had not been performed by September 1598. Furthermore, an apparent indebtedness to [[John Davies of Hereford|John Davies]]' ''Nosce teipsum'' at 1.2.51-58 and another to Samuel Daniels' ''[[Musophilus]]'' at 3.1.111-116 help situate the play in 1599.

In the fifth-act prologue of ''Henry V'', the Chorus refers to "antique Rome," "[[Plebs|plebeians]]" and "conqu'ring Caesar" (5.0.26-28), suggesting Shakespeare may already have had his mind on his next play.

:'''''First recorded performance''''': the entry in the Stationers' Register in July 1602 states that the play was "latelie Acted by the Lo: Chamberleyne his servantes." The title page of Q1 states that it had been performed in London, at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] universities, "and else-where." However, there is no record of any of these performances. The first definite performance of the play took place on a ship called the ''[[Red Dragon (1595)|Red Dragon]]'', anchored off the coast of Africa, on 5 September 1607. The evidence for this comes from Thomas Rundall's ''Narratives of Voyages Towards the North-East: 1496–1631'' (1849). Rundall includes extracts from the journal of Captain [[William Keeling]], who was in charge of three ships sponsored by the [[East India Company]] that left England for India in March 1607, but were almost immediately separated. The ''Red Dragon'', Keeling's flagship, was beset by storms and anchored off what is now Sierra Leone for six weeks. According to Keeling, the crew performed ''Hamlet'' on the nights of 5 September and "31 September" (presumably 1 October), and ''Richard II'' on the night of 30 September. There has been some argument as to the authenticity of Keeling's journal entry. Prior to Rundall's book, Keeling's journal had been published in 1625, but the references to ''Hamlet'' and ''Richard II'' were not included by the editor, [[Samuel Purchas]]. In his 1898 book, ''Life of Shakespeare'', [[Sidney Lee]] claimed the entire ''Red Dragon'' episode was probably a forgery by [[John Payne Collier]], and in 1950, Sydney Race revealed that the relevant pages were missing from the original journal and argued that a ship's crew would be incapable of mastering two of Shakespeare's most difficult plays. However, [[William Foster (historiographer)|William Foster]] pointed out that the entire journal had been missing since at least 1900, not just the relevant pages, and he countered Race by arguing that the crew probably performed truncated and edited versions of each play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Thompson | editor1-first=Ann | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Neil | title=Hamlet | location=London | publisher=Thompson Learning | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2006 | pages=53–55 | isbn=978-1-904271-33-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general feeling amongst scholars today is that the record is genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Gary | authorlink=Gary Taylor (scholar) | chapter=The Red Dragon in Sierra Leone | editor1-last=Kamps | editor1-first=Ivo | editor2-last=Singh | editor2-first=Jyotsna | title=Travel Knowledge: European "Discoveries" in the Early Modern Period | location=Basingstoke | publisher=Palgrave | pages=211–222 | isbn=978-0-312-22299-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded performance of the play in England took place at court over Christmas 1619.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Thompson | editor1-first=Ann | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Neil | title=Hamlet | location=London | publisher=Thompson Learning | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2006 | page=97 | isbn=978-1-904271-33-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''''Evidence''''': because the three versions of ''Hamlet'' which appeared in 1603, 1604/1605 and 1623 differ so much from one another, dating the play is exceptionally difficult. In his 1987 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare (which uses F1 as the control text), [[George Richard Hibbard|G R. Hibbard]] writes "exactly when ''Hamlet'' was composed depends in part on which ''Hamlet'' is under consideration, for the play exists in three different forms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Hibbard | editor-first=G.R. | title=Hamlet | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1987 | pages=3 | isbn=978-0-19-953581-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hamlet'' was originally written sometime between September 1599 and July 1602 (when it was registered in the Stationers Register). The ''terminus post quem'' of September 1599 is fixed by a reference to ''Julius Caesar'' (3.2.96-97), the earliest recorded performance of which took place in September 1599.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Hibbard | editor-first=G.R. | title=Hamlet | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1987 | pages=3–4 | isbn=978-0-19-953581-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Thompson | editor1-first=Ann | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Neil | title=Hamlet | location=London | publisher=Thompson Learning | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2006 | pages=49–51 | isbn=978-1-904271-33-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important internal piece of evidence is found in [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]'s report to [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] of "an aerie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for't" (2.2.335-337). This is probably a reference to the [[Children of the Chapel]], a playing company of young boys who performed at [[Blackfriars Theatre|Blackfriars]] with such success as to make them genuine rivals to the adult acting companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Hibbard | editor-first=G.R. | title=Hamlet | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1987 | page=5 | isbn=978-0-19-953581-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Thompson | editor1-first=Ann | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Neil | title=Hamlet | location=London | publisher=Thompson Learning | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2006 | pages=51–53 | isbn=978-1-904271-33-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent comment, "there has been much to-do on both sides; and the nation holds it no sin to tar them to controversy. There was, for a while, no money bid for argument, unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in to the question" (2.2.348-352) is thought to refer to the [[War of the Theatres]] between Ben Jonson on one side and [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]] and [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]] on the other. The conflict began in 1599 when Marston mocked Jonson with the character of Chrisoganus in ''[[Histriomastix (play)|Histriomastix]]''. Jonson responded by satirizing Marston's style in ''Every Man out of His Humour'', leading to a series of plays in which the various writers mocked one another. The "conflict" concluded in 1601, when Dekker mocked Jonson with the character of Horace in ''[[Satiromastix]]'', at which point Jonson and Marston apparently reconciled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Edwards | editor-first=Philip | title=Hamlet, Prince of Denmark | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2003 | edition=Revised | origyear=1985 | pages=4–5 | isbn=978-0-521-53252-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the reference to the child actors and the War of the Theatres suggest a date of composition of 1600–1601. Additionally, in his 1598 copy of the works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[Gabriel Harvey]] has written in a marginal note that Shakespeare's "''[[The Rape of Lucrece|Lucrece]]'' &amp; his ''tragedie of Hamlet, prince of Denmarke'', have it in them, to please the wiser sort." Harvey also mentions the Earl of Essex as still alive, which would suggest he wrote the note prior to 25 February 1601, when Essex was executed. This would seem to narrow the date of composition to between September 1599 and February 1601. However, not all scholars accept that Harvey's note can be used for dating purposes, mainly due to the fact that it infers [[Thomas Watson (poet)|Thomas Watson]] (d.1592) and [[Edmund Spenser]] (d.1599) are both still alive, but also mentions [[John Owen (epigrammatist)|John Owen]]'s 1607 epigrams, making it impossible to ascertain exactly when the note was written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Edwards | editor-first=Philip | title=Hamlet, Prince of Denmark | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2003 | edition=Revised | origyear=1985 | page=5 | isbn=978-0-521-53252-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stylistic evidence has also been cited, usually as illustrative of a date of composition of 1600 or 1601, with subsequent revisions up to, and possibly beyond, 1605.

:'''''Evidence''''': obviously the play was complete by February 1602. However, John Leslie Hotson believes it to have been written earlier, probably in late 1600. On the night of the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of the Epiphany]] (6 January) 1601, it is known the Lord Chamberlain's Men performed a play at Whitehall for Queen Elizabeth and [[Virginio Orsini, Duke of Bracciano]]. However, although official records contain much information on the preparations for the play, the name of the play itself is never mentioned. An official description of the unnamed play dictates "that [it] shall be best furnished with rich apparel, have great variety and change of music and dances, and of a subject that may be most pleasing to her Majesty." Hotson believes the unnamed play of 1601 was ''Twelfth Night'', the title of which refers to the [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night celebrations]] which bridge [[Christmas]] and the epiphany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hotson | first=John Leslie | authorlink=John Leslie Hotson | title=The First Night of Twelfth Night | url=https://archive.org/details/firstnightoftwel0000hots | url-access=registration | location=London | publisher=Macmillan | year=1954 | isbn=978-0-8414-4779-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars disagree with Hotson on this point, however, believing the description could just as easily fit ''Much Ado'' as ''Twelfth Night'', and arguing that rather than Shakespeare naming the character of [[Orsino (Twelfth Night)|Orsino]] in honour of the Duke who would be watching the play, it is more likely he took the name after meeting the Duke prior to writing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Elam | editor-first=Keir | title=Twelfth Night | location=London | publisher=Cengage Learning | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2008 | pages=93–95 | isbn=978-1-903436-99-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topical allusions serve only to fix 1599 as a ''terminus post quem''. [[Maria (Twelfth Night)|Maria]] makes reference to "the new map with the augmentation of the [[Indies]]" (3.2.74).

:'''''Evidence''''': just as its early performance history is far from clear, so too is the date of the play's composition. 1598 can be fixed as a ''terminus post quem'', as Shakespeare definitely used [[George Chapman]]'s ''Seven Books of the Illiad of Homer'' as a source, which was entered into the Stationers' Register in April 1598. Some scholars have attempted to link the play to the War of the Theatres, particularly the reference to the "Prologue armed" (l.23), which may be an allusion to the prologue in Jonson's ''[[The Poetaster]]'' (1601), in which an obviously infuriated Jonson lashes out at his detractors. However, the prologue in ''Troilus'' was not included in either Q{{sup|a}} or Q{{sup|b}}, making it difficult to directly connect it to the squabbles between the playwrights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Muir | editor-first=Kenneth | editor-link=Kenneth Muir (scholar) | title=Troilus and Cressida | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1982 | pages=5–7 | isbn=978-0-19-953653-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stylistic evidence is also inconclusive. A rare word test places it closest to ''Hamlet''. Ants Oras' pause test places it after ''Henry IV'' and before ''Othello'', but is unable to determine exactly where the play lies between the two. A colloquialism-in-verse test places it after ''Hamlet'' and before ''Twelfth Night''. Metrical analysis places it after ''Hamlet'' and ''Twelfth Night'' but before ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' and ''Othello''. This all suggests a date of composition of somewhere between 1600 and 1602, but the exact order in which ''Hamlet'', ''Twelfth Night'' and ''Troilus and Cressida'' were written seems impossible to determine.&lt;ref name="Taylor 123" /&gt;

:'''''Evidence''''': the original play is traditionally believed to have been written sometime between 1592 and 1595 by Munday and Chettle. The early scenes of the play depict "[[Evil May Day]]", the name given to an anti-alien riot in London in May 1517. Anti-alien riots also occurred in 1593 and 1595, followed by the execution of the ringleaders. In the play, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] is depicted as being relatively merciful to the instigators of the riots, whereas in 1595, Queen Elizabeth showed no such leniency. The theory is that no playwright would have written a play which knowingly portrayed the current monarch in such a negative light when compared to a previous monarch, and as Munday was an occasional government spy, he would be even less likely to do so. This places the date of initial composition as prior to the 1595 executions but probably after the initial re-emergence of [[xenophobia]] in the autumn of 1592.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blayney|first=Peter W.M.|date=April 1972|title=''The Booke of Sir Thomas Moore'' Re-Examined|url=|journal=Studies in Philology|volume=69|issue=2|pages=167–191|jstor=4173757}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tilney's specific objections to the depiction of the riots and their aftermath suggest that he received the play when these issues were still considered sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Gary | authorlink=Gary Taylor (scholar) | chapter=The Canon and Chronology of Shakespeare's Plays | editor1-last=Wells | editor1-first=Stanley | editor1-link=Stanley Wells | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Gary | editor2-link=Gary Taylor (scholar) | title=William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1997 | edition=Revised | origyear=1987 | page=139 | isbn=978-0-393-31667-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Honigmann | first=E.A.J. | authorlink=E.

Specifically, he may have got the name Signor Angelo, mentioned in the sailor's report (1.3.16), from Angelus Sorianus, a Venetian commander discussed in Knolles. Also, the sailor's description of Turkish tactics, "The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomites]], reverend and gracious,/Steering with due course toward the island of Rhodes,/Have there injoined with an after fleet" (1.3.34-36), may have come from Knolles' description of the Turkish fleets' actions prior to the siege of [[Nicosia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Neill | editor-first=Michael | title=Othello, the Moor of Venice | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2006 | page=400 | isbn=978-0-19-953587-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bate | first=Jonathan | authorlink=Jonathan Bate | title=Soul of the Age: The Life, Mind and World of William Shakespeare | location=London | publisher=Penguin | year=2008 | pages=298–299 | isbn=978-0-14-101586-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests September 1603 as a likely ''terminus post quem''.&lt;ref name="Sanders 1" /&gt; A possible ''terminus ante quem'' could be March 1604, when Philip Henslowe paid Thomas Dekker and [[Thomas Middleton]] for Part 1 of ''[[The Honest Whore]]'', which contains the line "more savage than a barbarous Moor."

James was interested in Turkish history, and had written a poem in 1591 about the [[Battle of Lepanto]]. The poem was republished upon his accession in 1603, and a play set amongst the events which ultimately led to that battle would have had a special interest for the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jones | first=Emrys | title=''Othello'', "Lepanto" and the Cyprus Wars | journal=Shakespeare Survey | volume=21 |year=1968 | pages=11–20 | url=http://universitypublishingonline.org/cambridge/shakespeare/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9781139053013&amp;cid=CBO9781139053013A008 | accessdate=2 August 2014 | doi=10.1017/CCOL0521072859.005| isbn=978-1-139-05301-3 }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would also support a date of 1603–1604. However, following H.C. Hart's 1928 edition of the play for the first series of the Arden Shakespeare, E.A.J. Honigmann dates the play mid-1601 to mid-1602, believing it to have influenced the bad quarto of ''Hamlet'' (in existence by July 1602). For example, he cites the substitution of the name "Montano" for "Reynaldo." Montano occurs in no other play except ''Othello'', and Honigmann believes the actor who worked on ''Hamlet'' Q1 played Reynaldo, but had played Montano in an earlier production of ''Othello'', and unconsciously mixed up the names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Honigmann | first=E.A.J. | authorlink=E.

In 1813, he formulated the theory that the play "as it has come down to us, was written at two different, and rather distinct periods of the poet's life."&lt;ref name="Hunter xix" /&gt; Further elaborated upon by John Payne Collier, this theory was widely accepted throughout the nineteenth century, with most scholars arguing for an initial period of composition in the mid-1590s and a second period in the mid-1600s.&lt;ref name="Snyder 21" /&gt; The basis of the argument was that although the play exhibited stylistic and thematic connections with ''Hamlet'' and ''Measure for Measure'', certain sections were seen as immature, and more akin to the type of material found in ''Two Gentlemen'', ''Taming of the Shrew'' or ''Comedy of Errors''. Often cited as immature were Helen's discussion about virginity in 1.1 and the [[Couplet|rhyming couplets]] in 2.1 and 2.2.

:'''''Evidence''''': although the existence of two distinct texts complicates the issue of dating the play, what is known for certain is that it must have been completed (in some form) by December 1606. The play could not have been written any earlier than March 1603, as determined by Shakespeare's use of [[Samuel Harsnett]]'s ''Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures'', from which he took some of Tom O'Bedlam's dialogue, which was entered into the Stationers' Register on 16 March 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Wells | editor-first=Stanley | editor-link=Stanley Wells | title=The History of King Lear | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2000 | page=10 | isbn=978-0-19-953582-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''terminus post quem'' can possibly be pushed forward to 1605. Gary Taylor believes that ''Lear'' was influenced by George Chapman, Ben Jonson and John Marston's ''[[Eastward Hoe|Eastward Ho]]'', written in early 1605, and [[George Wilkins]]' ''[[The Miseries of Enforced Marriage]]'', written no later than mid-1605.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Taylor | first=Gary | authorlink=Gary Taylor (scholar) | title=A New Source and an Old Date for ''King Lear'' | journal=[[The Review of English Studies]] | volume=33 | issue=132 | date=November 1982 | pages=396–413 | url=http://res.oxfordjournals.org/content/XXXIII/132/396.full.pdf+html | accessdate=27 October 2014 | doi=10.1093/res/XXXIII.132.396}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the line "these late eclipses in the sun and moon" (Sc.2.101&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Wells' 2000 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare does not divide the play into acts.&lt;/ref&gt;) could refer to the [[lunar eclipse]] of 17 September and the [[solar eclipse]] of 2 October 1605.&lt;ref name="Halio 1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Shaheen | first=Naseeb | authorlink=Naseeb Shaheen | title=Biblical References in Shakespeare's Plays | location=Cranbury, NJ | publisher=Associated University Presses | year=1999 | page=606 | isbn=978-1-61149-358-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of vital importance in dating the play, however, is the 1605 publication of an older version of the story, the anonymous play ''[[King Leir|The true Chronicle History of King Leir and his three daughters, Gonorill, Ragan and Cordella]]''. The publication of ''Leir'' in 1605 is often taken as evidence that Shakespeare's ''Lear'' was on stage by 1605. ''Leir'' was entered into the Stationers' Register on 14 May 1594, but had already been staged, and is usually dated to ''c.''1590. There is no evidence it was ever published prior to 1605, and its sudden appearance in print over ten years after its composition could represent evidence of an attempt to capitalise on the success of Shakespeare's newly released play.&lt;ref name="Halio 1-2"&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Halio | editor-first=Jay L. | title=The Tragedy of King Lear | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2005 | edition=Revised | origyear=1992 | pages=1–2 | isbn=978-0-521-61263-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in his 1997 edition of the play for the third series of the Arden Shakespeare, [[R. A. Foakes|R.A. Foakes]] argues the 1605 publication of ''Leir'' inspired Shakespeare to write his own version of the story. There is little doubt that Shakespeare used ''Leir'' as a source, and Foakes' believes that some of the parallels are too specific to represent Shakespeare's remembrance of a performance, rather he must have been working with a printed copy. Foakes also argues that the title page of Q1 specifically recalls the title page of the 1605 ''Leir'' to "alert" readers to the fact that Shakespeare's version is based on the older version, but is much improved. For example, this explains the reference to Edgar and Gloucester on the title page. These characters are not in ''Leir'', and their inclusion in the title of Q1 serves as an advertisement that Shakespeare's version of the story is more complex than ''Leir''. If Foakes is correct, it means Shakespeare could not have started writing ''Lear'' until May 1605.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Foakes | editor-first=R.A. | editor-link=R. A.

In 1603, Annesley's eldest daughter, Grace, tried to have him declared a lunatic so she would be placed in charge of his estate. She seems to have been supported in this by her husband (Sir John Wildgose), her sister (Christian) and her brother-in-law (William Sandys). However, Annesley's youngest daughter, Cordell, wrote to Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury for help, and successfully blocked Grace's plan. Annesley died in July 1604, and most of his estate was left to Cordell. Whether or not Shakespeare knew about the case is unknown, but if he did, it provides more evidence for a date of composition in the period 1604–1606.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Foakes | editor-first=R.A. | editor-link=R.

:'''''Evidence''''': because there is no reference to ''Timon'' until 1623, attempts to date the play must rely on topical allusions and stylistic analysis. A possible ''terminus ante quem'' is 1608. In his 2004 edition for the Oxford Shakespeare, John Jowett argues the lack of act divisions in the ''Folio'' text is an important factor in determining a date. The King's Men only began to use act divisions in their scripts when they occupied the indoor Blackfriars Theatre in August 1608 as their winter playhouse. ''Timon'' is notoriously difficult to divide into acts, suggesting to Jowett that it was written at a time when act divisions were of no concern to the writer, hence it must have been written prior to August 1608.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Jowett | editor-first=John | editor-link=John Jowett | title=The Life of Timon of Athens | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2004 | page=4 | isbn=978-0-19-953744-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''terminus post quem'' may come from a possible topical allusion to the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of November 1605; "those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire" (Sc.7.32-33&lt;ref&gt;John Jowett's 2004 edition of the play for the Oxford Shakespeare does not divide the play into acts. In editions which do divide the play, Oxford's Scene 7 is usually Act 3, Scene 3.&lt;/ref&gt;). In the context of the play, the line is referring to religious zeal, but some scholars feel it is a subtle reference to the events of November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Dawson | editor-first=Anthony B. | editor2-last=Minton | editor2-first=Gretchen E. | title=Timon of Athens | location=Boston, MA | publisher=Cengage Learning | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2008 | pages=12–13 | isbn=978-1-903436-97-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play may also have been influenced by a pamphlet published in June 1605, ''Two Unnatural and Bloody Murders'', which served as the primary source for Thomas Middleton's ''[[A Yorkshire Tragedy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Jowett | editor-first=John | editor-link=John Jowett | title=The Life of Timon of Athens | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2004 | page=6 | isbn=978-0-19-953744-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would narrow the possible range of dates to sometime between November 1605 and August 1608. Narrowing the date further, however, must come wholly from stylistic analysis. A metrical test links the play most closely with ''Hamlet'', ''Troilus and Cressida'' and ''King Lear'', whilst a colloquialism-in-verse test places it after ''All's Well'' but before ''Macbeth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Gary | authorlink=Gary Taylor (scholar) | chapter=The Canon and Chronology of Shakespeare's Plays | editor1-last=Wells | editor1-first=Stanley | editor1-link=Stanley Wells | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Gary | editor2-link=Gary Taylor (scholar) | title=William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1997 | edition=Revised | origyear=1987 | pages=127–128 | isbn=978-0-393-31667-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, MacDonald P.

:'''''First official record''''': in his [[Book of Plays|notes for a book]] on "Common Policy" (i.e. public morals), [[Simon Forman]] records seeing the play at the Globe on 20 April 1611. He actually dates the performance "1610, the 20th April, Saturday," but in 1610, 20 April was a Tuesday, and most scholars feel he accidentally wrote the wrong year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Brooke | editor-first=Nicholas | title=The Tragedy of Macbeth | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2008 | page=234 | isbn=978-0-19-953583-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''''First published''''': ''First Folio'' (1623), as ''The Tragedie of Macbeth''.
:'''''First recorded performance''''': possibly on 20 April 1611 at the Globe, recorded by Simon Forman. However, there is some doubt amongst scholars as to the veracity of Forman's account. Initially, the document itself was thought to be a forgery, as it was first brought to light by John Payne Collier amongst a group of documents many of which did prove to be inauthentic. Although J. Dover Wilson proved the document was genuine in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dover Wilson | first1=John | author1link=J.

For example, he makes no mention of the apparitions, or of [[Hecate]], and he virtually ignores the conclusion of the play, which is strange considering he was taking notes for a book about morals. He also mentions seeing [[Macbeth (character)|Macbeth]] and [[Banquo]] on horseback riding through a wood, something highly unlikely on the Globe stage. Furthermore, he describes the [[Three Witches|Weïrd Sisters]] as "nymphs or fairies," an unusual way to describe the characters as they appear in the play. However, "nymphs" is how they are described in one of Shakespeare's sources for ''Macbeth'', ''[[Holinshed's Chronicles]]''. This suggests Forman may have conflated witnessing a performance with reading the source material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Brooke | editor-first=Nicholas | title=The Tragedy of Macbeth | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2008 | pages=234–235 | isbn=978-0-19-953583-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Forman's account is not accepted as genuine, the first recorded performance was on 5 November 1664, as recorded by Samuel Pepys.&lt;ref name="Brooke 37"&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Brooke | editor-first=Nicholas | title=The Tragedy of Macbeth | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2008 | pages=37 | isbn=978-0-19-953583-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''''Additional information (revision)''''': because it is theorised by some scholars that the ''Folio'' text of ''Macbeth'' shows signs of revision, dating the play can be difficult. ''Macbeth'' is extremely short for a Shakespearean tragedy, and it is thought that F1 may have been set from a [[prompt book]] that had been shortened for performance, rather than from Shakespeare's own foul papers. First suggested by W.G. Clarke and W.A. Wright in their 1869 edition of the play for [[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]], the most likely person to have carried out the revision is Thomas Middleton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Braunmuller | editor-first=A.R. | title=Macbeth | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2008 | origyear=1997 | edition=Revised | pages=261–279 | isbn=978-0-521-86240-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play is listed in the ''Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works'' as "''The Tragedy of Macbeth'' by William Shakespeare, Adapted by Thomas Middleton,"&lt;ref name="Oxford 969"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Wells | editor1-first=Stanley | editor1-link=Stanley Wells | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Gary | editor2-link=Gary Taylor (scholar) | editor3-last=Jowett | editor3-first=John | editor3-link=John Jowett | editor4-last=Montgomery | editor4-first=William | title=The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2005 | edition=2nd | origyear=1986 | page=[https://archive.org/details/completeworks0000shak_f0m2/page/969 969] | isbn=978-0-19-926718-7 | url=https://archive.org/details/completeworks0000shak_f0m2/page/969 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its date is recorded as "1606; adapted 1616."

:'''''Evidence''''': the play is closely connected to King James, and scholars are in general agreement that it is unlikely to have been written prior to his accession in 1603. He considered Banquo his direct ancestor, and eight [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] kings preceded James, just as Banquo is depicted at the end of "a show of eight kings" (4.1.126.1-2).&lt;ref name="Oxford 969" /&gt; In 1790, Edmond Malone dated the play 1606, and the majority of scholars still accept this date even whilst acknowledging little conclusive evidence exists, other than the fact that it 'seems' correct in the context of Shakespeare's other work of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Brooke | editor-first=Nicholas | title=The Tragedy of Macbeth | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2008 | page=59 | isbn=978-0-19-953583-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some possible topical allusions, however, which do support a date of 1606. For example, the Porter's mention of "an equivocator that could swear in both the [[Justice|scales]] against either scale" (2.3.7-9) is a possible reference to the Gunpowder plot, specifically the trial of [[Henry Garnet]] in March 1606.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Brooke | editor-first=Nicholas | title=The Tragedy of Macbeth | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2008 | page=60 | isbn=978-0-19-953583-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Weïrd Sisters' account of ''The Tiger'' (1.3.8-26) is thought to allude to a ship of the same name that returned to England on 27 June 1606 after a disastrous voyage in which many of the crew were killed by pirates. At 1.3.22-23, the First Witch says "Weary sev'n-nights, nine times nine,/Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine." The real ship was at sea 567 days, the product of 7x9x9, which has been taken as a confirmation of the allusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Loomis | first=Edward Alleyn | title=The Master of the Tiger | journal=[[Shakespeare Quarterly]] | volume=7 | issue=4 | date=Autumn 1956 | page=457 | jstor=2866386 | doi=10.2307/2866386}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this theory is correct, the play could not have been written any earlier than July 1606.

:'''''Evidence''''': obviously, the play was written by May 1608.

If Barnes is here alluding to ''Anthony and Cleopatra'', in which Cleopatra kills herself by making an asp bite her on the breast and arm (5.2.302-312), it must have been on stage by January 1607 at the very latest, suggesting composition in 1606.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Neill | first=Michael | title=The Tragedy of Anthony and Cleopatra | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1994 | pages=20–22 | isbn=978-0-19-953578-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Wilders | first=John | title=Antony and Cleopatra | location=London | publisher=Routledge | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=1995 | pages=69–73 | isbn=978-1-904271-01-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''''First published''''': published in quarto in 1609 as ''The Late and much admired Play, Called Pericles, Prince of Tyre. With the true Relation of the whole History, adventures, and fortunes of the sayd Prince: As also, The no lesse strange, and worthy accidents, in the Birth and Life, of his Daughter Mariana'' (printed by William White and Thomas Creede for Henry Gosson). This text was republished in 1609 (again by White and Creede for Gosson), 1611 (by Simon Stafford for Gosson) 1619 (as part of William Jaggard's "False Folio", printed by Thomas Pavier), 1630 (by John Norton for Robert Bird) and 1635 (by [[Thomas Cotes]] for Robert Bird). ''Pericles'' did not appear in the ''First Folio'' (1623), the ''Second Folio'' (1632) or the first impression of the ''Third Folio'' (1663). It was added to the second impression of the ''Third Folio'' (1664; printed by Coates for [[Philip Chetwinde]]) as ''The much admired Play, called, Pericles, Prince of Tyre.

:'''''First recorded performance''''': the Venetian ambassador to England from 5 January 1606 to 23 November 1608, Zorzi Giustinian, saw a production of the play during his time in London. He was accompanied by the French ambassador, Antoine Lefevre de la Boderie, and his wife, who arrived in England in April 1607. Giustinian noted that he paid admission, so the play must have been public. As the theatres were closed from April to December 1607 and from July to November in 1608, he must have seen the play at sometime between January and June of 1608.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Delvecchio | editor1-first=Doreen | editor2-last=Hammond | editor2-first=Anthony | title=Pericles, Prince of Type | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=1998 | page=1 | isbn=978-0-521-29710-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known datable production was at the manor house of Sir John Yorke, Gouthwaite Hall in [[North Yorkshire]], on 2 February 1610, performed by the Cholmley Players.

:'''''Additional information (attribution)''''': as the play was not included in the ''First Folio'', there has always been doubt as to whether or not Shakespeare actually wrote it.

Traditionally, for some scholars, the simple fact that ''Pericles'' is included with such a group is proof enough that Shakespeare did not write it.&lt;ref name="Taylor 130"&gt;{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Gary | authorlink=Gary Taylor (scholar) | chapter=The Canon and Chronology of Shakespeare's Plays | editor1-last=Wells | editor1-first=Stanley | editor1-link=Stanley Wells | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Gary | editor2-link=Gary Taylor (scholar) | title=William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1997 | edition=Revised | origyear=1987 | page=130 | isbn=978-0-393-31667-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a contested field, the most widely accepted theory is that Shakespeare collaborated on the play with another playwright, probably George Wilkins. Although the collaboration theory dates back to at least 1709 (Nicholas Rowe's ''The Works of Mr. William Shakespeare''), the theory of Wilkins' involvement originated in 1868, suggested by [[Nicolaus Delius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Warren | editor-first=Roger | title=A Reconstructed Text of Pericles, Prince of Tyre | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=2003 | page=62 | isbn=978-0-19-953683-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkins status as co-author is generally accepted by modern scholars, and Delius' original breakdown of scenes remains the most widely agreed upon; Wilkins worked on scenes 1-9 and Shakespeare on scenes 10-22.&lt;ref name="Taylor 130" /&gt; However, because the 1609 quarto is so badly corrupted and generally regarded as a poorly constructed memorial reconstruction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Wells | editor1-first=Stanley | editor1-link=Stanley Wells | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Gary | editor2-link=Gary Taylor (scholar) | editor3-last=Jowett | editor3-first=John | editor3-link=John Jowett | editor4-last=Montgomery | editor4-first=William | title=The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2005 | edition=2nd | origyear=1986 | page=[https://archive.org/details/completeworks0000shak_f0m2/page/1059 1059] | isbn=978-0-19-926718-7 | url=https://archive.org/details/completeworks0000shak_f0m2/page/1059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no complete agreement as to the motives or mechanism of the collaboration, with some scholars arguing for Shakespeare as sole author. For example, in their 1998 edition of the play for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, Doreen Delvecchio and Anthony Hammond reject the theory of co-authorship, arguing that the problems inherent in the text arise not because of collaborative writing, but because of especially poor memorial reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Delvecchio | editor1-first=Doreen | editor2-last=Hammond | editor2-first=Anthony | title=Pericles, Prince of Type | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=1998 | pages=197–210 | isbn=978-0-521-29710-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in his 2002 book ''Shakespeare, Co-Author'', Brian Vickers is highly critical of Delvecchio and Hammond's analysis, arguing that co-authorship of the play is a virtual certainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Vickers | first=Brian | authorlink=Brian Vickers | title=Shakespeare, Co-Author: A Historical Study of Five Collaborative Plays | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2002 | pages=291–332 | isbn=978-0-19-926916-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 2003 book, ''Defining Shakespeare'', MacDonald P. Jackson analyses, amongst other aspects, versification, rhyme, function words, [[pronoun]] usage, metrical patterns and [[elision]]s.

:'''''Evidence''''': in 1608, Wilkins published a prose version of the story called ''The Painful Adventures of Pericles Prince of Tyre, Being the True History of the Play of Pericles, as it was lately presented by the worthy and ancient poet [[John Gower]]'', which contains numerous phrases that seem to recall specific lines from the play, suggesting work on the play preceded composition of the prose version. In fact, some scholars consider Wilkins' prose version to be a more accurate record of the original script than the 1609 quarto, and several modern editors have incorporated passages from Wilkins' prose into the play text, such as Roger Warren's 2003 edition for the Oxford Shakespeare, based on a text prepared by Gary Taylor and MacDonald P. Jackson, or the version in the 2nd edition of the ''Oxford Shakespeare: Complete Works'' (2005), edited by Taylor. Stylistic analysis places the play in the period of 1607–1608. A rare word test of scenes 10-22 place them closest to ''The Tempest'', whereas a rare word test of scenes 1-9 place them closest to ''1 Henry IV''. If Shakespeare wrote 10-22, the proximity to ''The Tempest'' makes sense. If Wilkins wrote 1-9, Gary Taylor has suggested that due to the immense popularity of ''1 Henry IV'', Wilkins may have read it during composition in an effort to write in a Shakespearean manner. Ants Oras' pause test places scenes 10-22 closest to ''Macbeth'' and ''Antony and Cleopatra''.&lt;ref name="Taylor 130" /&gt; Taken together, the stylistic evidence, the 1608 Stationers' Register entry, Wilkins' 1608 prose version, the 1608 performance seen by Giustinian, and the 1609 quarto, all serve to suggest a date of composition of 1607 or very early 1608.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Barroll | first=J.

:'''''Evidence''''': ''The Winter's Tale'' can be a difficult play to date precisely due to a lack of contemporary references and topical allusions.

This may be an allusion to Ben Jonson's masque ''[[Oberon, the Faery Prince]]'', which was performed at court on 1 January 1611. This would place the most likely date of composition sometime in mid-1610.

:'''''Evidence''''': obviously, the play was complete by September 1611. A ''terminus post quem'' of 1608 can be fixed with reasonable certainty insofar as the spectacular stage direction in 5.3, when "[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] descends in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle," suggests Shakespeare wrote the play with the indoor stage equipment of Blackfriars in mind, which places the date as after August 1608.&lt;ref name="Oxford 1185" /&gt; The play also has connections with two other plays of the period; [[Francis Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s ''[[Philaster (play)|Philaster, or Love Lies a-Bleeding]]'' and Thomas Heywood's ''The Golden Age''. ''Philaster'' and ''Cymbeline'' have strong verbal and tonal parallels, and both feature a broadly similar plot. Scholars are in general agreement that the plays were written around the same period, and that one influenced the other. The direction of influence, however, is not certain. If Beaumont and Fletcher were influenced by ''Cymbeline'', they must have seen it in performance. However, the theatres were closed until at least December 1609, meaning the play could not have been staged until early 1610. ''Philaster'' was read in MS by John Davies in October 1610, so if ''Philaster'' was influenced by ''Cymbeline'', it must have been written in the first half of 1610.&lt;ref name="Taylor 132"&gt;{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Gary | authorlink=Gary Taylor (scholar) | chapter=The Canon and Chronology of Shakespeare's Plays | editor1-last=Wells | editor1-first=Stanley | editor1-link=Stanley Wells | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Gary | editor2-link=Gary Taylor (scholar) | title=William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1997 | edition=Revised | origyear=1987 | page=132 | isbn=978-0-393-31667-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this contradicts Andrew Gurr's evidence that ''Philaster'' was written in late 1609.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Gurr | editor-first=Andrew | editor-link=Andrew Gurr | title=Philaster Or, Love Lies a-Bleeding | location=Manchester | publisher=Manchester University Press | series=The Revels Plays | year=2003 | origyear=1969 | edition=Revised | page=xxvi-xxix | isbn=978-0-7190-6485-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Shakespeare would have had access to the ''Philaster'' MS, making it more likely that ''Philaster'' preceded ''Cymbeline''.

As Heywood commonly borrowed from Shakespeare's work, the likely explanation here is that ''Cymbeline'' preceded ''Golden Age''. However, the date of ''Golden Age'' is uncertain. It was published in 1611, but there is some evidence it may have been written in late 1610.

Warren argues that the play was performed at court during the [[investiture]] of James' eldest son [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry]] as [[Prince of Wales]], which ran from 31 May to 6 June. Central to the celebrations was Samuel Daniels' ''Tethys' Festival'', which foregrounded [[Milford Haven]] as the "port of union" where Henry's ancestor Henry Tudor had landed to face Richard III.

:'''''Evidence''''': the date of ''The Tempest'' can be securely fixed between September 1610 and October 1611. Obviously, to have been on stage on 1 November, it must have been completed before November, and it is unlikely that the Whitehall performance was the first performance (plays were rarely performed at court without previously appearing on the public stage). The ''terminus post quem'' of September 1610 can be fixed by Shakespeare's use of a real incident as source material. In May 1609 a fleet of nine ships set sail from Plymouth, heading for [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], carrying five hundred colonists. On 29 July, the flagship, the ''[[Sea Venture]]'', was driven off course by a storm and wrecked on the coast of Bermuda. All hands were thought lost, but on 23 May 1610 her passengers arrived safely in Virginia, having found shelter on Bermuda, where they repaired the [[Pinnace (ship's boat)|pinnaces]] and completed their journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Wells | editor1-first=Stanley | editor1-link=Stanley Wells | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Gary | editor2-link=Gary Taylor (scholar) | editor3-last=Jowett | editor3-first=John | editor3-link=John Jowett | editor4-last=Montgomery | editor4-first=William | title=The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2005 | edition=2nd | origyear=1986 | page=[https://archive.org/details/completeworks0000shak_f0m2/page/1221 1221] | isbn=978-0-19-926718-7 | url=https://archive.org/details/completeworks0000shak_f0m2/page/1221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The play is particularly indebted to [[William Strachey]]'s ''[[True Reportory|A True Reportory of the Wracke and Redemption of Sir Thomas Gates]]'', written in Virginia, and dated 15 July. The MS was carried back to England by [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Gates]] himself, who arrived in London in early September.

Theobald claimed that he had access to the original play in the form of three manuscripts. The play had been staged at Drury Lane in December 1727, to great box office success, and was revived in 1728.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Wells | editor1-first=Stanley | editor1-link=Stanley Wells | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Gary | editor2-link=Gary Taylor (scholar) | editor3-last=Jowett | editor3-first=John | editor3-link=John Jowett | editor4-last=Montgomery | editor4-first=William | title=The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2005 | edition=2nd | origyear=1986 | page=[https://archive.org/details/completeworks0000shak_f0m2/page/1245 1245] | isbn=978-0-19-926718-7 | url=https://archive.org/details/completeworks0000shak_f0m2/page/1245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an article in the ''Gazetteer'' on 31 March 1770, "the original Manuscript of this play is now treasured up in the Museum of Covent Garden Playhouse." However, the article is unclear on whether it is referring to the original ''Cardenio'' manuscript by Shakespeare and Fletcher or the original ''Double Falsehood'' script by Theobald. In any case, the library burned down in 1808.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Hammond | editor-first=Brian | title=Double Falsehood or The Distressed Lovers | location=London | publisher=Methuen | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2010 | pages=113, 122 | isbn=978-1-903436-77-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theobald's 1728 publication contains a preface which reads, in part, "It has been alleged as incredible, that such a curiosity should be stifled and lost to the world for above a century. To this my answer is short: that though it never till now made its appearance on the stage, yet one of the manuscript copies which I have is of above sixty years standing, in the handwriting of [[John Downes (prompter)|Mr. Downes]] the famous old prompter; and, as I am credibly informed, was early in the possession of the celebrated [[Thomas Betterton|Mr. Betterton]] and by him designed to have been ushered into the world. What accident prevented this purpose of his, I do not pretend to know; or through what hands it had successively passed before that period of time. There is a tradition (which I have from the noble person, who supplied me with one of my copies) that it was given by our author, as a present of value, to a natural daughter of his, for whose sake he wrote it, in the time of his retirement from the stage. Two other copies I have (one of which I was glad to purchase at a very good rate), which may not, perhaps, be quite so old as the former; but one of them is much more perfect, and has fewer flaws and interruptions in the sense."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book | editor-last=Hammond | editor-first=Brian | title=Double Falsehood or The Distressed Lovers | location=London | publisher=Methuen | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=2010 | pages=1671–169 | isbn=978-1-903436-77-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''''Additional information (attribution)''''': ''Cardenio'' is considered a lost play, and whether or not Shakespeare had anything to do with it is an unanswered (and, given the available evidence, perhaps unanswerable) question. Only two sources attribute it to Shakespeare; Moseley's 1653 Stationers' Register entry and Theobald's 1727 adaptation. Although the 1613 court payment does connect the play to the King's Men, this does not mean Shakespeare wrote it, as the company performed many plays in which he had no hand. The validity of Moseley's attribution is not helped by the fact that he is known to have attributed several other now lost plays to Shakespeare. For example, on 29 June 1660, he made an entry in the Register for "the History of [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]]. [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester|Duke Humphrey]], a Tragedy.

E.K. Chambers points out several problems with Theobald's asserted ownership of the text; no one else ever confirmed seeing the three manuscripts, Theobald's claim that he owned them is the only evidence we have; there is no evidence Shakespeare had a "natural daughter" (i.e. an illegitimate daughter), he had two legitimate daughters, and one son, who died age eleven (although John Freehafer argues the reference to "a natural daughter" is to Henrietta Maria du Tremblay, the wife of Shakespeare's (alleged) illegitimate son, [[William Davenant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Freehafer | first=John | title=Cardenio, by Shakespeare and Fletcher | journal=[[Modern Language Association|PMLA]] | volume=84 | issue=3 | date=May 1969 | pages=501–513 | jstor=1261138 | doi=10.2307/1261138}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;); the manuscripts apparently disappeared after Theobald's death and were not listed in his sale catalogue of 23 October 1744; the play is never mentioned in the writings of either Downes or Betterton; and if Theobald was so certain of Shakespeare's authorship, why did he not include the play in his 1734 edition of the complete works?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Chambers | first=E.K. | authorlink=E.

In his 1957 edition of the play for the second series of the Arden Shakespeare, R.A. Foakes argues the overriding theme of the play, especially the final scene, showing the christening of the future Queen Elizabeth, would have perfectly suited the political atmosphere of the period. In early 1613, there was much suspicion of Spain, and Catholic conspiracy, and it was hoped that the marriage would produce an alliance with the devoutly Protestant German princes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Foakes | editor-first=R.A. | editor-link=R.

Jackson's rare word test, which found that the sections of the play thought to be by Shakespeare must be dated to the very end of his career, and if the non-Shakespearean sections were treated as Shakespearean they would be dated to 1599–1600, an obvious impossibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Jackson | first=MacDonald P. | authorlink=MacDonald P.

:'''''First published''''': published in quarto in 1634 (printed by Thomas Cotes for [[John Waterson]]).
:'''''First recorded performance''''': although the play must have been staged prior to October 1614, records of early productions are vague. The 1619 list may be a list of recently performed plays, but it could also be a list of plays proposed for future performance.&lt;ref name="Chambers 346" /&gt; The inclusion of two actors' names in stage directions in the 1634 quarto text (4.2.70.1 and 5.3.0.2) suggest the play was staged in 1625 or 1626 (the actors mentioned are "Curtis" (probably Curtis Greville) and "T. Tucke", (Thomas Tuckfield), both of whom were with the King's Men for the 1625–1626 season only).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Waith | editor-first=Eugene M. | title=The Two Noble Kinsmen | url=https://archive.org/details/twonoblekinsmen01fletgoog | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1989 | page=[https://archive.org/details/twonoblekinsmen01fletgoog/page/n19 3] | isbn=978-0-19-953745-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quarto text also claims the play had recently been performed at Blackfriars. However, the earliest known performance is in the form of William Davenant's adaptation ''The Rivals'' in 1664.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Potter | editor-first=Lois | title=The Two Noble Kinsmen | location=London | publisher=Thomas Nelson | series=The Arden Shakespeare, Third Series | year=1997 | pages=74–77 | isbn=978-1-904271-18-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known production of the straight Shakespearean/Fletcher text was in The Old Vic on 28 March 1928, directed by Andrew Leigh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Waith | editor-first=Eugene M. | title=The Two Noble Kinsmen | url=https://archive.org/details/twonoblekinsmen01fletgoog | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | series=The Oxford Shakespeare | year=1989 | page=[https://archive.org/details/twonoblekinsmen01fletgoog/page/n50 34] | isbn=978-0-19-953745-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''''Additional information (attribution)''''': attributed to Shakespeare and Fletcher by both the Stationers' Register entry and the 1634 quarto, there is also much internal evidence that the play was a collaboration between the two. Studies of vocabulary, metre, imagery, pause patterns, the treatment of sources as well as linguistic analysis and rare word tests all suggest the play had two distinct authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=Gary | authorlink=Gary Taylor (scholar) | chapter=The Canon and Chronology of Shakespeare's Plays | editor1-last=Wells | editor1-first=Stanley | editor1-link=Stanley Wells | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Gary | editor2-link=Gary Taylor (scholar) | title=William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1997 | edition=Revised | origyear=1987 | page=134 | isbn=978-0-393-31667-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare is thought to have written Act 1, 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, and most of Act 5 (except 5.4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Wells | editor1-first=Stanley | editor1-link=Stanley Wells | editor2-last=Taylor | editor2-first=Gary | editor2-link=Gary Taylor (scholar) | editor3-last=Jowett | editor3-first=John | editor3-link=John Jowett | editor4-last=Montgomery | editor4-first=William | title=The Oxford Shakespeare: The Complete Works | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2005 | edition=2nd | origyear=1986 | page=[https://archive.org/details/completeworks0000shak_f0m2/page/1279 1279] | isbn=978-0-19-926718-7 | url=https://archive.org/details/completeworks0000shak_f0m2/page/1279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''''Evidence''''': the [[morris dance]] in 3.5 borrows from Francis Beaumont's ''[[The Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray's Inn]]'', which was performed at court on 20 February 1613, probably by the King's Men. A ''terminus ante quem'' is fixed by Ben Jonson's ''[[Bartholomew Fayre: A Comedy|Bartholomew Fair]]'', first performed on 31 October 1614, which twice sarcastically refers to "Palemon"; Palamon is one of the protagonists in ''Noble Kinsmen''. This establishes a date of composition sometime between February 1613 and October 1614.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Turner | editor1-first=Robert Kean | editor2-last=Tatspaugh | editor2-first=Patricia | title=The Two Noble Kinsmen | location=Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | series=The New Cambridge Shakespeare | year=2012 | page=6 | isbn=978-0-521-68699-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument has also been made that the play may have been commissioned specifically for the festivities surrounding the marriage of Princess Elizabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine in February 1613. At the time, the country was still in mourning for Prince Henry, who had died in November 1612. Henry was devoutly Protestant, a keen proponent of [[chivalry]] and was delighted with Elizabeth's choice of husband. Until his death, he was the main planner behind the wedding celebrations and it has been speculated that perhaps Beaumont's ''The Masque of the Inner Temple'' was written to cater to Henry's penchant for chivalry. [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s "[[The Knight's Tale]]", upon which ''Two Noble Kinsmen'' is based, is a chivalric romance, and would have been especially fitting for a wedding organised by Henry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Wickham | first=Glynne | chapter=''The Two Noble Kinsmen'' or ''A Midsummer Night's Dream Part II?'' | title=The Elizabethan Theatre VII | date=1980 | editor-last=Hibbard | editor-first=G.R. | location=Toronto, Ontario | publisher=PD Meany | pages=167–196 | isbn=978-0-88835-008-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Strong | first=Roy | authorlink=Roy Strong | title=Henry Prince of Wales and England's Lost Renaissance | location=London | publisher=Pimlico | year=1986 | pages=35–48 | isbn=978-0-7126-6509-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
