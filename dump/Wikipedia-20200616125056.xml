'''''Call Me Madam''''' is a [[musical theater|musical]] written by [[Howard Lindsay]] and [[Russel Crouse]], with music and lyrics by [[Irving Berlin]].

The musical is a [[satire]] on [[politics]] and [[foreign policy]] that [[Parody|spoof]]s post-war America's penchant for lending billions of dollars to needy countries. It centers on Sally Adams, a well-meaning but ill-informed [[socialite]] widow, who is appointed [[United States]] [[Ambassador]] to the fictional European country of Lichtenburg (unconnected to the real [[Lichtenburg concentration camp|Lichtenburg]] which came to fame in 1945 as a concentration camp, but ironically with the inhabitants being clearly Germanic). Signs in Lichtenburg are written in German, and inhabitants wear traditional [[Bavaria]]n costume. While there, she charms the local gentry, especially Cosmo Constantine, while her [[press attaché]] Kenneth Gibson falls in love with Princess Maria.

==Background==
The lead character is based on [[Washington, D.C.]] hostess and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] fundraiser [[Perle Mesta]], who was appointed Ambassador to [[Luxembourg]] in 1949. The ''[[Playbill]]'' distributed at each performance humorously noted that "neither the character of Mrs. Sally Adams nor Miss [[Ethel Merman]] resemble any person living or dead."

In 1949, Merman and her family were vacationing at the [[Hotel Colorado]] in [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado|Glenwood Springs]] with Howard Lindsay and his wife Dorothy Stickney. Watching Merman poolside while reading a magazine article about Mesta, Lindsay was struck by how typically "American" she was and immediately envisioned her portraying a colorful character similar to the newly appointed ambassador. When he proposed the idea to Merman, who had little interest in either society or political news, she responded, "Who's Perle Mesta?"&lt;ref name=Kellow&gt;Kellow, Brian, ''Ethel Merman: A Life''. New York: Viking Press 2007. {{ISBN|0-670-01829-5}}, pp. 121-142&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Merman had announced she was interested in playing a dramatic role in her next project, Lindsay and Russel Crouse approached [[Irving Berlin]] and began working on the book for ''Call Me Madam'' when he expressed interest in composing the score. Berlin's last production, ''[[Miss Liberty]]'', had failed to recoup its investment, and he was determined to repeat the success he had had with ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]''. The three collaborators agreed they needed to treat their subject with care to avoid any legal action by Mesta. As the work progressed, Merman conceded she would be willing to sing two or three songs, but eventually accepted the fact she was going to star in a full-scale musical comedy instead of the drama she preferred.&lt;ref name=Kellow /&gt;

Producer [[Leland Hayward]] budgeted the production at $250,000. In exchange for the original cast recording and television broadcast rights, he arranged to have it financed 100% by [[RCA Records]] and [[NBC]], with the two sharing 35% of the net earnings. In order to increase the profits, Hayward decided to charge an all-time high of $7.20 for orchestra seats.&lt;ref name=Kellow /&gt;

Hayward hired [[George Abbott]] to direct, and Abbott and casting director [[Harold Prince]] auditioned thousands of actors for the twenty speaking roles and twenty-nine chorus members. [[Raoul Pene du Bois]] was hired to design sets and costumes, although the wardrobe worn by Merman was the responsibility of [[Mainbocher]].&lt;ref name=Kellow /&gt;

Once the script was completed, everyone agreed that, while it was little more than standard [[situation comedy]] material, it was a perfect vehicle for Merman, and that Berlin's score, although far from his best, was tuneful and memorable. It included the comic song "Mr. Monotony", which originally was written for and dropped from the film ''[[Easter Parade (film)|Easter Parade]]''. Berlin had then included it in ''Miss Liberty'', but it was dropped from that as well. In this instance, the third time was not the charm: during out-of-town tryouts, Merman insisted it be dropped. (In 1988, [[Sarah Brightman]] recorded it for her CD ''The Songs That Got Away''.) To fill the hole its omission left in the second act, Berlin wrote "Something to Dance About" to give the second act a lively opening. When the star requested a duet with Russell Nype playing her lovestruck press attaché, Berlin responded by writing the [[counterpoint]] tune "[[You're Just in Love]]" and it ultimately became a showstopper at every performance.&lt;ref name=Kellow /&gt;

==Productions==
Directed by George Abbott and choreographed by [[Jerome Robbins]], the musical premiered at the [[Shubert Theatre (New Haven)|Shubert Theatre]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] on September 11, 1950. Reviews were mixed - ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said it "inspires warm applause rather than cheer"—and Berlin wrote two new songs to bolster the sagging second act. It opened in Boston on September 19, and while ''[[The Boston Record]]'' thought it offered "only an occasional flash of inspirational fire", it played to standing-room-only audiences throughout the run.&lt;ref name=Kellow /&gt;

With a record advance sale of $2 million,&lt;ref name=Kellow /&gt; the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production opened on October 12 at the [[Imperial Theatre (Broadway)|Imperial Theatre]], where it ran for 644 performances and grossed more than $4 million.&lt;ref name=Kellow /&gt; In addition to Merman and Nype, the cast included [[Paul Lukas]], [[Pat Harrington, Sr.]], [[Galina Talva]], [[Lilia Skala]], [[Tommy Rall]] and [[Richard Eastham]]. [[Brooks Atkinson]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' thought it offered one of Berlin's "most enchanting scores: fresh, light, and beguiling, and fitted to lyrics that fall out of it with grace and humor", and the ''[[New York Post]]'' called Merman "indescribably soul-satisfying", "a comedienne of rare skill", and "one of the joys of the world."&lt;ref name=Kellow /&gt; She remained with the show for the entire run and appeared in the limited four-week engagement staged to celebrate the reopening of the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=Kellow /&gt;

Apart from playing Rose in the first national tour of ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'', the role of Sally Adams in ''Call Me Madam'' would be the only stage role which Ethel Merman would reprise after originating it on Broadway. In July 1965 Merman would headline a revival by the [[Valley Music Theater]] in which Richard Eastham and Russell Nype also reprised their Broadway roles: the production playing an encore engagement - without Nype - in [[Houston]] that October. Merman, Eastham and Nype again reprised their Broadway roles for a 1967 summer stock tour of ''Call Me Madam'' in which [[Donna McKechnie]] was originally featured as Princess Maria, a role assumed by [[Carole Wells]] before the tour's end.

The national tour of ''Call Me Madam'' was headlined by [[Elaine Stritch]]: Merman's [[understudy]] during the show's Broadway run, Stritch had never had occasion to perform as Sally Adams at the Imperial, her debut in the role being at a matinee performance during the show's May 1952 Washington D.C. engagement. Subsequent to engagements at the [[Regional Enterprise Tower#Nixon Theater|Nixon Theater]] in Pittsburgh and the [[Hanna Theatre]] in Cleveland - with respective openings on June 2 and June 9, 1952 - the ''Call Me Madam'' national tour opened at the [[Hazard's Pavilion|Philharmonic Auditorium]] June 23, 1952 with further engagements in nine other cities - including Chicago and Detroit - the finale being an engagement at the [[Iroquois Park]] Amphitheater in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] in August 1953. Throughout most of the tour Stritch's leading man was [[Kent Smith]] as Cosmo Constantine, although [[Richard Smart (actor)|Dick Smart]] would take over the role before the tour's end. The cast of the national tour also included Pat Harrington, Sr. and Jay Velie reprising their Broadway roles. Stritch would reprise the role of Sally Adams in two regional theatrical productions, headlining ''Call Me Madam'' for [[the Muny|St. Louis Municipal Opera Theatre]] in 1954 - with Russell Nype reprising his Broadway role - and for the [[Valley Forge Music Fair]] in 1956.

''Call Me Madam'' returned to the New York stage for the first time since its original Broadway run via the [[New York City Center]] ''[[Encores!]]'' semi-staged concert version - with [[Tyne Daly]] headlining a cast including [[Walter Charles]] as Cosmo Constantine, [[Lewis Cleale]] as Kenneth and [[Melissa Errico]] as Princess Maria. Presented in February 1995 &lt;ref&gt;[http://broadwayworld.com/bwidb/productions/Call_Me_Madam_3789/ Encores 1995 listing] broadwayworld.com, accessed March 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; as the inaugural production of Encores! second season, ''Call Me Madam'' was lauded as the company's first hit production. Encores! would present a fully-staged production of ''Call Me Madam'' in February 2019, with [[Carmen Cusack]] headlining a cast which included [[Darrell Hammond]] as Grand Duke Otto, [[Carol Kane]] as Grand Duchess Sophie, [[Stanley Wayne Mathis]] as Senator Borckbank, [[Randy Rainbow]] as Sebastian Sebastian, and [[Lauren Worsham]] as Princess Maria.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.stageleft.nyc/blog/2019/2/7/review-encores-call-me-madam-with-carmen-cusack&lt;/ref&gt;

''Call Me Madam'' had its premiere regional theatrical engagement at the [[State Fair of Texas|Dallas State Fair]] in August 1952: with [[Joan Blondell]] headlining and Russell Nype reprising his Broadway role, the cast also included [[William LeMassena]] as Pemberton Maxwell, [[Michael Pollock (tenor)|Michael Pollock]] as Sebastian Sebastian and [[Gene Raymond]] as Cosmo Constantine. In 1959 [[Constance Bennett]] would headline a production of ''Call Me Madam'', featuring [[Wilbur Evans]] as Cosmo Constantine, which played engagements at the [[Camden County, New Jersey|Camden County]] Music Fair and at the [[Helen Storrow#Storrowtown Village|Storrowtown]] Music Fair. Also in 1959 [[Penny Singleton]] would headline a 1959 production by the [[the Muny|St. Louis Municipal Opera Theatre]] in which both Russell Nype and Pat Harrington, Sr. reprised their Broadway roles. Wilbur Evans would reprise the role of Cosmo Constantine in a 1963 production headlined by [[Martha Raye]] which played engagements at the [[Valley Forge Music Fair]] and at the Storrowtown Music Fair, with Kenneth Gibson being played by [[James Kirkwood Jr.|James Kirkwood]]. [[Margaret Whiting]], who headlined a 1961 production of ''Call Me Madam'' which played engagements in Boston and New Jersey, would in 1966 headline the play's Melody Top [[summer stock]] production in [[Milwaukee]] which featured [[Tommy Sands (American singer)|Tommy Sands]] as Kenneth Gibson.

[[Jo Anne Worley]], who headlined the 1987 [[Pasadena Convention Center]] production of ''Call Me Madam'', would also headline a semi-staged concert version mounted in 2001 at the [[Auditorium Theatre]] ([[Chicago]]) with [[Malcolm Gets]] as Kenneth Gibson and [[Fred Willard]]. [[Leslie Uggams]] would headline a revival of ''Call Me Madam'' mounted at the [[Paper Mill Playhouse]], [[Millburn, New Jersey]], in April–May 1996: the additional cast included [[J. B. Adams]] as Henry Gibson/ Grand Duke Otto, [[Mark Baker (actor)|Mark Baker]] as Pemberton Maxwell, and [[Vanessa Dorman]] as Princess Maria.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Alvin. [http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9805E4DD1F39F932A15757C0A960958260 "From Washington to Lichtenburg via Berlin"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 21, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2000 ''Call Me Madam'' was mounted at the [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television|UCLA Freud Playhouse]] with [[Karen Morrow]] headlining a cast which included [[Robert Mandan]] as Pemberton Maxwell, [[Michael Nouri]] as Cosmo Constantine, [[Hugh Panaro]] as Kenneth Gibson, and [[Michael Tucci]] as Congressman Wilkins.

Other regional productions of ''Call Me Madam'' have been headlined by [[Maxene Andrews]] (Coachlight Dinner Theater &lt;small&gt;[[East Windsor, Connecticut|East Windsor CT]]&lt;/small&gt;/ 1976), [[Klea Blackhurst]] ([[42nd Street Moon]] &lt;small&gt;[[San Francisco]]&lt;/small&gt;/ 2009), [[Kim Criswell]] with [[Catherine Brunell]] as Princess Maria  and [[David Hess]] as Cosmo Constantine ([[Goodspeed Musicals]] &lt;small&gt;[[Middlesex County, Connecticut|Middlesex County CT]]&lt;/small&gt;/ 2004), [[Ruta Lee]] ([[Casa Mañana]] &lt;small&gt;[[Fort Worth]]&lt;/small&gt;/ 1978), and [[Helen Reddy]] with [[Monte Markham]] as Cosmo Constantine ([[Broadway Sacramento|Sacramento Civic Light Opera]]/ 1986).

''Call Me Madam'' opened in the [[West End theatre|West End]] at the [[London Coliseum]] on March 15, 1952 for a run of 486 performances: [[Billie Worth]] headlined a cast which included [[Anton Walbrook]] as Cosmo Constantine and [[Shani Wallis]] - in her first major stage role - as Princess Maria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://broadwayworld.com/bwidb/productions/Call_Me_Madam_3787/ Call Me Madam listing] broadwayworld.com, accessed March 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noele Gordon]] - who had [[understudy|understudied]] Worth during the Coliseum run of ''Call Me Madam'' - headlined the production's British touring edition in 1953 and in 1983 would headline a West End revival whose cast also included [[Jeremy Hawk]] as Pemberton Maxwell and [[Basil Hoskins]] as Cosmo Constantine: opening March 14, 1983, the production was afforded a seven-week run at the [[Victoria Palace Theatre|Victoria Palace]]. ''Call Me Madam'' has since had two evident London [[fringe theatre|fringe]] productions, the first at [[Upstairs at The Gatehouse]] in the summer of 2009 with [[Thom Southerland]] directing a cast which included Beverley Klein as Sally Adams, Chris Love as Kenneth Gibson, Kate Nelson as Princess Maria, and Gido Schimanski as Cosmo Constantine. Subsequently, the [[Union Theatre, London]] would mount ''Call Me Madam'' in the fall of 2012: staged and directed by Michael Strassen, the production - headlined by Lucy Williamson leading as cast which included Gavin Kerr, Leo Miles and Natalie Lipin - received five nominations at the Off West End Awards and was named as one of the productions when the Union won Best Fringe at The Stage Awards in 2013 alongside The Globe (Best Theatre).

''Call Me Madam'' began its inaugural Australian engagement on September 5, 1953 at [[Her Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne]]: with [[Evie Hayes]] headlining a cast which also included [[David Cahill]] as Hugo Tantinnin and [[Alec Kellaway]] as Congressman Wilkins, the production would play subsequent engagement in [[Brisbane]] and [[Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RnG_tEGjSloC&amp;pg=PA504&amp;lpg=PA504&amp;dq=Evie+Hayes+Call+Me+Madam+1953&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CN5Ph5_HsW&amp;sig=U2PRVRU7kTpdbDiDnC00L-dR970&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqkLOiwtPZAhWPmOAKHWjvDeU4ChDoAQgoMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Evie%20Hayes%20Call%20Me%20Madam%201953&amp;f=false "Australian Dictionary of Biography, 1981-1990"] books.google.com, accessed March 4, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Revived in 1985 at the [[Canberra Theatre]] with [[June Bronhill]] headlining and [[David Branson]] featured as Cosmo Constantine, ''Call Me Madam'' would in 2000 be mounted at the [[Arts Centre Melbourne]] with [[Geraldine Turner]] headlining a cast which included [[Rachael Beck]] as Princess Maria, [[Reg Gorman]] as Congressman Wilkins, and [[Spencer McLaren]] as Kenneth Gibson.

==Recordings==
In a highly unusual situation, two [[LP album]]s of the score were released. The recording rights had been granted to [[RCA Victor]], which had invested in the show, but Merman was under contract to [[Decca Records]], which refused to allow her to record the [[cast album|original cast album]]. Decca issued a 10-inch LP featuring Merman singing some of her songs, accompanied by arranger-conductor [[Gordon Jenkins]] and His Orchestra and Chorus, with vocalizing by [[Dick Haymes]] (who joined Merman in the show's biggest hit, "[[You're Just in Love]]", their single reaching ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's number 30 for a week) and [[Eileen Wilson]] (who sang "[[It's a Lovely Day Today]]" with Haymes). RCA Victor went ahead with the original cast album replacing Merman with [[Dinah Shore]]. Merman was called back into the Decca studios to record additional songs from the show, and the label quickly re-released the album as a 12-inch LP under the title ''Ethel Merman: 12 Songs from Call Me Madam''. The Victor album sold reasonably well, attaining the sixth spot on the ''Billboard'' popular album charts, but the LP was out of print from 1956 until RCA Red Seal reissued it briefly in 1977. Peaking at number two on ''Billboard''{{'}}s popular album charts, Merman's Decca recording, which would appear on [[MCA Records]] beginning in 1973, stayed steadily in print until the end of the LP era. Merman's ''Madam'' album currently is available on a Decca Broadway CD, which also features Merman singing four [[Cole Porter]] tunes from the stage score of ''[[Panama Hattie]]'' (1940).

Merman also is heard on the film soundtrack album (with Donald O'Connor and George Sanders), issued in 1953 as a 10-inch album, also on the Decca label. Scoring fifth position on ''Billboard'' "s popular albums charts when first released, the soundtrack, taken out of print in 1957, was reissued in 1981 by Stet Records on a 12-inch LP which also contained songs from the film scores of ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1955) and ''[[I'll Cry Tomorrow]]'' (1955). The Merman soundtrack has not been legally updated to a CD.

A 1995 Broadway concert cast album, featuring [[Tyne Daly]], [[Lewis Cleale]], [[Christopher Durang]], [[Ken Page]], and [[Melissa Errico]], is available on the DRG label.

The original London [[West End theatre|West End]] cast recording, starring Billie Worth and [[Anton Walbrook]], has been released on the Sepia label.

==Promotional appearances==
On the premiere episode of NBC Radio's ''[[The Big Show (NBC Radio)|The Big Show]]'' on November 5, 1950, original Broadway cast members [[Ethel Merman]], [[Paul Lukas]], and [[Russell Nype]] appeared in the first half-hour (of the hour-and-a-half program) and performed songs from the score in order of their appearance in the production, while host [[Tallulah Bankhead]] filled in story notes between songs (although accidentally missing one story cue). Merman sang "The Hostess With the Mostes' on the Ball," then Lukas sang "Lichtenburg," then Merman sang "Can You Use Any Money Today?" and "[[The Best Thing for You (Would Be Me)]]," and finally Merman sang "[[You're Just in Love]]" with Nype.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/download/OTRR_The_Big_Show_Singles/Big_Show_50-11-05_001_Fred_Allen__Jimmy_Durante.mp3 The Big Show from November 5, 1950] ''The Big Show'' - Single Episodes from the Old Time Radio Researchers Group at the Internet Archive, accessed November 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
